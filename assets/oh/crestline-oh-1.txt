Adopting Ordinance
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND RE-ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY, AS AMENDED.
 
   WHEREAS the Council of the Village of Crestline, Ohio, has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
 
   WHEREAS it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification; and
 
   WHEREAS the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to
be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council:
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, be it ordained by the Council of the Village of Crestline,
Ohio that:
 
Section 1. The ordinances of the Village of Crestline, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
reenacted as the Codified Ordinances of Crestline, Ohio, 1993.
One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct by
the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part hereof,
and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Crestline, Ohio.
 
Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All ordinances
and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to August 2, 1993, which are
inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to August 2, 1993.
 
Section 3. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.21 and 731.23 the Clerk-Treasurer shall
cause to be published in a manner required by law this Adopting Ordinance
together with a summary of the new matter contained in the codification adopted
hereby.
 
Section 4. Wherefore this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety,
convenience and welfare of the Village of Crestline and the inhabitants
thereof, for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the
earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the
officials and residents of the Village, so as to facilitate administration,
daily operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately upon its passage.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Crestline Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

CHAPTER 109
Public Records
109.01   Public records policy.
109.02   Public records.
109.03   Records requests.
109.04   Costs for public records.
109.05   Failure to respond to a public records request.
109.01 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)   Introduction.   It is the policy of the Village of Crestline in
Crawford County that openness leads to a better-informed citizenry, which leads
to more transparent government and sounder public policy. It is our policy to
strictly adhere to the State's Public Records Act as well as other state and
federal laws.
   (b)   Ohio's Public Records Act imposes two primary obligations upon public
offices:
      (1)   Provide prompt inspection of public records (Ohio R.C. 149.43 (b)
(1)); and
      (2)   Provide copies of public records within a reasonable period of time
(Ohio R.C. 49.43 (B)(2)
   (c)   The Public Records Act evolved from the principle that Ohio's citizens
are entitled to access the records of their government. We agree that to
advance that principle, the Public Records Act should be interpreted liberally
in favor of disclosure.
(Ord. 3363. Passed 11-20-23.)
109.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Under Ohio law, a public office may only create records that are
necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the
agency and for the protection of the legal and financial rights of the state
and persons directly affected by the agency's activities. (Ohio R.C. 149.40)
   (b)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and court rulings, "records"
are defined as those items that meet all of the following:
      (1)   Any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or
characteristic, including an electronic record (which includes but is not
limited to e-mail or other record created, generated, sent, communicated,
received, or stored by electronic means);
      (2)   That is created or received by, or coming under the jurisdiction of
a public office; and
      (3)   That documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the office. (Ohio R.C. 149.011
(G))
   (c)   The determination of whether a specific item constitutes a "record"
will depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular item
requested. The Ohio Supreme Court has imposed an actual use standard in
defining a "record", which means that an item is not automatically a "record"
simply because the public office could (but did not) use a document it received
to carry out its duties and responsibilities.
   (d)   Furthermore, a public office is not required to create new records to
respond to a public records request, even if it is only a matter of compiling
information from existing records.
   (e)   It is the policy of the Village of Crestline in Crawford County that,
as required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they
are made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during
regular business hours. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(1)]
   (f)   Copies will be made available upon request within a reasonable period
of time. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(1)].
   (g)   A current record retention schedule will be readily available to the
public upon request. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(2)].
   (h)   Not all of the Village of Crestline's records are "public records."
Certain records are exempt from the Public Records Act. Exempt records include
records:
      (1)    The release of which is prohibited by state or federal law, or
      (2)    That are subject to an express exception set forth in Ohio's
Public Records Act, which may be released only if the Village of Crestline
decides to waive the express exception.
   (i)   Examples of records, the release of which is prohibited by state or
federal law, include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Attorney-Client privilege information
      (2)   Records of a Certified Public Accountant or public accountant in
the performance of an audit of a public office [Ohio R.C. 4701.19(B)]
      (3)   Federal tax returns [26 U.S.C. 6103 (a)]
      (4)   Criminal background information and other law enforcement
information on the LEADS / CCH NCIC computer database [U.S.C. 3789 (G)]
      (5)   Records that have been sealed pursuant to a statutorily authorized
court order [Ohio R.C. 2953.52]
      (6)   Peace Officer's home address during the pendency of a criminal case
in which the officer is a witness or arresting officer [Ohio R.C. 2921.24 (a)]
      (7)   Employees' and their family members records that were created for
purposes of the Family Medical Leave Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act
[29 CFR 825.500 (g)]
   (j)   Examples of records that are subject to an express exception set forth
in Ohio's Public Records Act, which may be released only if the Village of
Crestline decides to waive the express exception include, but are not limited
to, the following:
      (1)   Peace Officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor, assistant prosecutor,
children's services worker, or corrections officer, residential and familial
information [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (A)(7)]
      (2)   Records that pertain to a patient's medical history, diagnosis,
prognosis, or medical condition and that were general and maintained in the
process of medical treatment [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (A)(1)(a)
      (3)   Records that contain information that was specifically compiled in
reasonable anticipation of of, or in defense of, a civil or criminal action or
proceeding [Ohio R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(g)]
      (4)   Records that pertain to a law enforcement matter of a criminal,
quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature and that, if released, would
create a high probability of disclosing any of the following:
         A.   The identity of an uncharged suspect;
         B.   The identity of a confidential source;
         C.   Specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures;
         D.   Specific investigative work product; or
         E.   Information that would endanger the life or physical safety of
law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a confidential source
[Ohio R.C. 149.43 (A) (2)].
   (k)   The exemption to the Public Records Act will be narrowly construed by
the Village of Crestline in the favor of disclosure. The Village of Crestline
may seek a legal review prior to determining whether or not an exception
applies.
(Ord. 3363. Passed 11-20-23.)
109.03 RECORDS REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the Village of Crestline to identify, retrieve, and review the
records. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records such
that the Village of Crestline cannot reasonably identify what public records
are being requested, then the Village of Crestline may deny the request. In
such case, the Village of Crestline will provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing them of the manner in which
records are maintained by the Village of Crestline and accessed in the ordinary
course of the Village of Crestline's duties [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(2)].
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide their identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. However, the records custodian may ask for a written request and
may ask for the requestor's identity and/or intended use of the information
requested if (1) it would benefit the requestor by helping the public office
identify, locate or deliver the records being sought, and (2) the requestor is
informed that written request and the requester's identity and intended use of
the information requested not required [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(5)].
   (c)   The Village of Crestline will permit a requester to choose to have the
public record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium which the Village of
Crestline keeps it, or upon any other medium which the Village of Crestline
determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the
normal operations of the Village of Crestline. The Village of Crestline is not
required to allow the requester to make the copies of the public record [Ohio
R.C. 149.43 (B)(6)].
   (d)   Public records should be available for inspection at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Public records should be made available
for inspection promptly [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(1)]. To the extent that an office
may operate 24-hours a day, the records of that office will be made available
for inspection during normal administrative hours only.
      Copies of public records should be made within a reasonable period of
time. [Ohio R.C. 149.43(B)(1)]
      The determination of the terms "prompt" and "reasonable" take into
account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the location where
the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the records
requested.
   (e)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), resolutions,
budgets, etc.
   (f)   Upon request, the Village of Crestline will provide copies of public
records to a requester by United States Mail or by any other delivery means or
transmission that the Village of Crestline deems reasonable. [Ohio R.C. 149.43
(B)(7)]
      The Village of Crestline will limit to ten the number of copies of a
public record provided per month to a requester by United States Mail, unless
the requester certifies in writing that they do not intend to use or forward
the requested records, or the information contained within, for commercial
purposes. (the word "commercial" should be narrowly construed and does not
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information to
assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or activities of
government, or nonprofit educations research). [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(7)]
   (g)   By Ohio law, the Village of Crestline is not required to permit a
person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile
adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal
investigation if the subject of the investigation or prosecution were an adult,
unless the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect
to the person, or the judge's successor in office, finds that the information
sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a
justifiable claim of the person. [Ohio R.C. 149.43(B)(8)]
   (h)   The Village of Crestline, in response to a written request made and
signed by a journalist, which must include the journalist's name and title and
the name and address of the journalist's employer and which states that the
disclosure of the information sought would be in the public interest, will
provide the address of the actual personal residence of anyone employed by the
Village of Crestline as a peace officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor,
assistant prosecutor, children's services worker, or corrections officer, and,
if such employee's spouse, former spouse, or child is employed by a public
office, the name and address of that public office. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(9)]
   (i)   Any denial of public records requested, in part or whole, should
include an explanation, including legal authority, as to why the request was
denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the explanation for
denial will be provided to the requester in writing. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)(3)]
      If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt
portions should be redacted and the rest released. If there are redactions, the
Village of Crestline will notify the requester of any redaction or make the
redaction plainly visible. Each redaction should be accompanied by a supporting
explanation, including legal authority, as to why the redaction was made. [Ohio
R.C. 149.43(B)(1) and (2)]
   (j)   The Village of Crestline has no duty to provide records acquired after
a request for records is complete. (Ord. 3363. Passed 11-20-23.)
109.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records should be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, unless the cost is otherwise set by statute. [Ohio R.C. 149.43
(B)(1)]. Employee time should not be calculated into the charge for copying a
public record. However, in the event that circumstances make it reasonable for
the Village of Crestline to hire an outside contractor to make copies of
requested records, the requester will be charged the actual cost paid to the
outside contractor for the copying service. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (F)(2)(a)]. These
circumstances may include, but not be limited to, a lack of in-house
photocopying resources or labor.
   The Village of Crestline has no duty to provide copies of public records
free of charge to someone who indicates an inability or unwillingness to pay
for them.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is ten cents ($0.10) per page, twenty
cents ($0.20) per double-sided. Audio files are not included. A disk or
compatible audio device must be provided by the requester.
   (b)   The Village of Crestline may require a requester to pay in advance the
cost involved in providing the copy of the public record, as requested. [Ohio
R.C. 149.43(B)(6)]
   (c)   Upon request, the Village of Crestline will provide copies of public
records to a requester by United States mail or by any other delivery means or
transmission that this office deems reasonable. This office may require such a
requester to pay in advance the cost of postage or costs incurred for other
supplies used in the mailing, delivery, or transmission. [Ohio R.C. 149.43 (B)
(7)]
   (d)   There may be instances when the Village of Crestline may be able to
provide copies made in-house without disrupting its normal functions, not only
over an extended period of time. In that instance, the Village of Crestline may
offer the requester the options of (1) having the documents produced through a
faster method by employing temporary personnel and equipment, (2) using an
external private contractor, or (3) having the documents produced in-house by
this public office's normal staff and equipment in a less efficient and more
time-consuming manner.
      (Ord. 3363. Passed 11-20-23.)
109.05 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The Village of Crestline recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the Village's failure
to comply with a request may result in the requester commencing mandamus action
against the Village in either the court of common pleas, in the court of
appeals, or in the Supreme Court of Ohio. The court may order the Village to
comply with the Public Records Act, as well as order this office to pay
statutory damages of one-hundred dollars for each business day (beginning with
the day the requester files the mandamus action) during which this public
office failed to comply (up to a maximum of one-thousand dollars ($1,000), as
well as court costs and the requester's reasonable attorney fees.

         A.   The employee must have exhausted all paid leave available to the

based upon the unusual, severe, or emergency conditions facing the employee on
a case-by-case basis. The employee's attendance record prior to the request for
hours from the sick leave bank, for reasons other than the current basis for
the request, may be considered.

illness, injury, or surgery is covered by Workers' Compensation.

(Ord. 3280. Passed 3-1-21.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
171.01   Mayor’s Court Magistrate.
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

and after July 1, 1990, by resident individuals of the Municipality.
   (b)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on

activities, derived from work done or services performed or rendered and
business or other activities conducted in the Municipality.
   (f)   On that portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned on

   (i)   Business Allocation Percentage Formula.
      (1)   In the taxation of income which is subject to Municipal income
taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation
shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the municipal corporation, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for purpose
of municipal income taxation. In the absence of such records, net profits from
a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average net book value
of all the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereof by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services wherever made or performed.
         In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulation, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
      (2)   As used in subsection (h)(1) hereof, "sales made in a municipal
corporation" means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation.
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
         D.   In the computation of any tax due under this chapter, a business
loss of a previous tax year shall not be allowed or carried forward to reduce
the tax due in any subsequent tax year.
            (Ord. 1810. Passed 2-5-90.)
   (j)   That the income of an individual who has taken a deduction for federal
income tax purposes as reported on Form 2106 and which taxpayer has not been
allowed a deduction for this amount for which they have applied under the
municipal income tax ordinance where the income was earned, shall be allowed a
deduction under this ordinance minus the amount of credit received from the
municipality where the income as earned upon satisfactory proof presented to
the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2645. Passed 2-28-05.)
181.03 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Such tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to salaries,
wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and after July 1, 1990, and
with respect to the net profit of businesses, professions and other activities
earned on and after July 1, 1990. Provided, however, that where the fiscal year
of the business, profession or other activity differs from the calendar year,
the tax shall be applied to that part of the net profit for the fiscal year as
shall be earned on and after July 1, 1990, to the close of the taxpayer's
fiscal year; thereafter the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis.
(Ord. 1810. Passed 2-5-90.)
181.04 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer whose earnings or profits are subject to the tax imposed
by this chapter shall, on or before April 15, 1991 and on or before April 15 of
each year thereafter, make and file a final return with the Tax Administrator
on a form obtainable from the Tax Administrator or on a generic form as defined
in this chapter, setting forth the aggregate amount of salary, wages or other
compensation and net profits earned by him or her during the preceding year of
period and subject to the tax, together with other pertinent information as the
Tax Administrator may require. Provided, however, that when the final return is
made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the
return shall be made within the 15th day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxpayer’s fiscal year.
   (b)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed on such
earning and profits. The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereof. Provided, however, that where any portion of such tax shall have been
paid by such taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.05 and/or Section
181.06, credit for the amount shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due
and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing
the final return.
   (c)   The return of an employee showing the amount of tax deducted by the
employer or employers from the salaries, wages or compensation of any employee,
and paid by him or them to the Tax Administrator, shall be accepted as the
return required of any such employee whose sole income subject to the tax of
two percent (2%) is such salary, wages or compensation.
   (d)   Beginning January 1, 2001 any taxpayer that has requested an extension
for filing a Federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing
of an income tax return required in this chapter. The taxpayer shall make the
request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s request for a Federal filing
extension with the office of the Tax Administrator. The request for extension
shall be filed not later than the last day for filing the income tax return
required by paragraph (a) of this section. The Municipality shall grant such a
request for an extension for a period of not less than the last day of the
month following the month to which the due date of the federal return has been
extended. The Municipality may deny a taxpayer’s request for an extension only
if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file a copy of the
request for the Federal extension, owes the Municipality any delinquent income
tax or any penalty, interest, assessment, or other charge for the late payment
or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax
return, report, or other related document for a prior tax period. The granting
of an extension for filing an income tax return does not extend the last date
for paying the income tax without penalty, unless the Municipality grants an
extension, in writing, to that date. In addition, if unusual circumstances
exist for the taxpayer, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing of
the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period not to exceed
six (6) months, or three (3) months beyond any extension granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return.
However, the Tax Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of the tax shown to be due thereon by the date the
request for extension is filed and the actual tax to be paid within the period
as extended. The taxpayer shall be responsible for interest and penalty if the
amount shown on the tentative return is less than the actual amount determined
to be payable in the final return.
   (e)   A tax in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) or less will not be
collected or refunded, provided that this subsection shall not be applicable to
taxes collected at the source under the provisions of Section
181.05, and provided further that nothing in this subsection shall dispense
with any requirement of this chapter relating to the filing of declarations,
returns and questionnaires.
   (f)   If a business has sustained a net operating loss in any taxable year,
such loss may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (g)   A taxpayer may aggregate rentals for a net rental income, but no net
loss may be taken against other income nor may it be carried either forward or
backward.
   (h)   The residents of the Municipality are subject to taxation upon net
income from rentals on all properties located in the Municipality, and/or on
all properties located outside the Municipality, with credit being given for
income tax or taxes paid to other municipalities on rental profits on
properties in those other municipalities, but with said credit not to exceed
the total rate levied in this chapter. Non-residents of the Municipality are
subject to such taxation only if the real property is situated within the
Municipality and shall receive no credit for taxes paid to another
municipality.
   (i)   In no case may a taxpayer deduct business losses or rental losses
against wages or other compensation earned as an employee. (Ord. 2586. Passed
12-15-03.)

2879, passed July 29, 2009.
   (k)   Each person who was a resident of Crestline at any time during the
taxable year shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon; and each person who
was a nonresident who has a business operation within Crestline; and each
nonresident person who has been employed with Crestline and received any type
of compensation or salary where Crestline income tax is either not withheld or
such withholding is not equal to the Crestline income tax owed shall make and
file a return on or before April 15 of the following year.
   (l)   No joint tax returns may be filed under this Chapter even though the
taxpayers filed a joint return under federal or state income tax law.
   (m)   Within thirty days of receiving a tax refund from another municipality
for which credit has been claimed on a taxpayer’s Crestline return, as
permitted by Section
181.07, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended Crestline return and pay
any additional tax shown thereon. (Ord. 2676. Passed 10-24-05.)

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under

behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two

   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

days" if either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid.
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax

Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided, net profit from a business or
profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality

taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

182.19 of this Chapter.
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (B) of this section,

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (A)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer
is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which

relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a
credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance under Section

section for the purposes of that division or division (A)(2) of this section,

reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services

         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that

have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is

location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location. provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election.
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (B)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(l)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(l)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division(A)(1)(c) of this section. and
notwithstanding division (A)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety

      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.

of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section

extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th, day of the eleventh month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time

the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension

period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section 182.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed

the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:

      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
 
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

23-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
 182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue

(Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

Administrator.
(Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section 182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as
provided by division (D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)

be subject to Sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio R.C. in lieu of the

R.C., except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio R.C. "Taxpayer" may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
(Ord. 3376. Passed 4-1-24.)
182.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

   (B)   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
182.091 as though the same were continuing.

182.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 3136. Passed 11-23-15.)
182.99 VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may

R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless

to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in

the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for seventy-two
consecutive hours.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left

Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.

the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open

willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a

flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified

withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency

have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy- two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three- day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

   The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
    The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail
term under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

device, the user grants to the Police Department the right to conduct any form
of investigation deemed necessary to verify the authenticity of the alarm.
Panic alarm users shall execute waivers to be submitted to the Chief of Police
which will allow the Police Department the right to enter the premises of the
alarm user to verify the alarm. The contents of such waiver shall be specified
by the Village Attorney.
      (2)    It shall be deemed a violation of this section if a panic device
is activated for anything other than that specified in the section.

as hereby adopted shall remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. 3184. Passed 7-17-17.)

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently

aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.

complaint as to such respondent. A copy of its orders shall be delivered in all
cases to the Clerk of Council. The Board shall establish rules of practice to

in the Municipality in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this
section shall, on recommendation of the Director be ordered relaid to conform
to the provisions of this section, within the time allowed by law after service
of notice to construct such sidewalks. However, if such sidewalk was built or
constructed pursuant to a notice theretofore given, to build or construct such
sidewalk, and the walk is then built or constructed contrary to the provisions
of this section, the Administrator may order such sidewalk to be torn up and
construct the same according to the provisions of this section without further
notice. In any and all cases where Council builds or constructs any sidewalks,
the entire cost and expense incident thereto, shall be charged to the abutting
property and collected as provided by law.
 
   (h)   Hereafter sidewalks shall be located as follows: On streets forty feet
or more in width, the inner edge of the sidewalk shall be one foot from the lot
line. On all streets less than thirty-three feet in width, the inner edge shall
be the lot line. It shall be the duty of the Engineer to give and fix the grade
and alignments of any and all sidewalks hereafter constructed. When such grade
and alignment is given, the Engineer shall take into consideration the
sidewalks that are now constructed along the streets, so that as far as
possible a uniformity can be maintained. All grades and alignments shall be in
conformity to the established Municipal grades.

discharged to the building sewer.
 
   (j)   Excavations. All excavations required for the installation of a
building sanitary sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by
the Safety-Service Director. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in
accordance with the latest ASTM specifications except that no backfill shall be
placed until the work has been inspected.
 
   (k)   Joints.
      (1)   All joints and connections in sanitary sewers shall be made
gastight and watertight. Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with
oakum or hemp and filled with molten lead, Federal Specification (QQ-L-156) not
less than one inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight. No
paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material
until after the joint has been tested and approved.
      (2)   All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals
shall be made with approved hot-poured jointing material or cement mortar as
specified below.
      (3)   Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160
degrees Fahrenheit, and shall not be soluble in any of the wastes carried by
the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp or
similar approved materials.
      (4)   Cement joints shall be made by packing a closely twisted jute, or
oakum gasket, of suitable size to fill partly the annular space between the
pipes. The remaining space shall be filled and firmly compacted with mortar
composed of one part of Portland cement and three parts of mortar sand. The
material shall be mixed dry; however, sufficient water shall be added to make
the mixture workable. Mortar which has begun to set shall not be used or
retempered. Lime putty or hydrated lime may be substituted to the extent of not
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the volume of the Portland cement that
may be added.
      (5)   Other jointing materials and methods may be used only upon approval
of the Safety-Service Director.
 
   (l)   Connecting Building Sewer into Public Sewer. The connection of the
building sanitary sewer into the public sanitary sewer shall be made at the "Y"
branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer
is twelve inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is
available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building
sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of approximately
forty-five degrees. A forty-five degree ell may be used to make such
connection, with the spigot and cut so as not to extend past the inner surface
of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of
connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the
public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure
and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the
connection only when approved by the Safety- Service Director.
 
   (m)   Inspections. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify
the Safety- Service Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection
and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Safety-Service Director or his representative.
 
   (n)   Safety Requirements; Restoration of Pavement. All excavations for
building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored
in a manner satisfactory to the Municipality.
 
   (o)   Laying Pipe in Streets. No person or corporation shall lay any pipe or
conduit for any purpose whatsoever in any street within five feet on either
side of a public sewer in any street without permission of the Safety-Service
Director.
 
   (p)   Repair of Surface. Any settlement of the surface over a drain on any
street or public way occurring within six months after the laying of the drain
shall be repaired by the Municipality at the expense of the drain layer, if the
repairs are not made by the drain layer within twenty-four hours after notice
to repair is given to such drain layer by the Safety-Service Director.
(Ord. 465. Passed 1-17-66.)
921.13 PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (a)   Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under the
provisions of Section
921.03(d), the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system complying with the provisions of this section.
 
   (b)   Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal
system, the owner shall first obtain a written memorandum from the Safety-
Service Director that the applicant's property is not within 100 feet of a
public sanitary sewer.
 
   (c)   The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage disposal
system shall comply with the provisions of the Revised Code and all regulations
of the department of public health of the State. No septic tank or cesspool
shall be permitted to discharge into any public sewer or natural outlet.
 
   (d)   At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served
by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in Section
921.03(d), a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance
with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private sewage
disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable material.
 
   (e)   The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal
facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the
Municipality.

921.15 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES; METERS; BILLING.
   (a)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the Municipal
sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied
by the Water Department and the water used thereon or therein is not measured
by a Municipal water meter, or by meter acceptable to the Safety-Service
Director, then in each such case the amount of water so used shall be otherwise
measured or determined by the Safety-Service Director in order to determine the
sewer service charge or rental provided in Section
921.14, or the owner or other interested party at his expense may install and
maintain a meter acceptable to the Safety-Service Director for such purpose.
(Ord. 845. Passed 12-3-73.)
   (b)   In the case a lot or parcel of land, building or premises discharges
industrial wastes, either directly or indirectly into the Municipal sewerage
system, and the Safety-Service Director finds that it is not practical to
attempt to measure such waste by meter, they shall measure such waste in such
manner and by such method as they may find practicable in the light of the
conditions and attendant circumstances of the case, in order to determine the
sewer service charge or rental. The Municipality may require all property
owners to install a meter outside the building.
   (c)   In addition to the charge or rental determined according to the rates
specified herein a further charge of ten percent (10%) of such amount so
determined shall be added thereto in each case of failure to make prompt
payment, and the total thus obtained shall be the sewerage service charge or
rental in each such case.
   (d)   The period within which payment shall be made in order to be
classified as a "prompt payment" shall be determined by the Safety-Service
Director and shall be expressed through the rules or regulations which he is
authorized by this chapter to make for the purposes hereof.
   (e)   The sewer service charge or rental shall be payable quarterly at the
office of the Water Department and at the option of Council may be made payable
at the same time as water bills are payable.
   (f)   For any lot, land, building or premises from which connection is made
with the Municipal sewerage system or which begins to discharge sewage, any
industrial waste, water or other liquid into the Municipal sewerage system,
either directly or indirectly, after this section becomes effective, a charge
shall be made pursuant to this section, the same to be a per diem pro rata
amount based upon the minimum rate per quarter from the time such sewer
connection is made, or such discharge into the Municipal sewerage system,
either directly or indirectly, is begun, until the next following quarter
period, except should the measured service exceed the minimum charge the
corresponding measured rate or rates shall be charged.
   (g)   The charge or rental levied and assessed by this section shall be
payable in four quarterly payments in each year, as provided in subsection (e)
hereof, provided that the amount of the rental payable for any lot or premises
at the first payment period after this section becomes effective shall be
determined on the basis of a per diem proratement of the minimum charge herein
established beginning with the date this section becomes effective, except that
in those cases in which the metered or measured charge will exceed the minimum
charge, the metered or measured charge shall be the basis.
   (h)   Each charge or rental levied by or pursuant to this chapter is hereby
made a lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection
to the sewerage system of the Municipality, and if the payment is not made
within ninety days after it is due and payable it shall be certified to the
County Auditor, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the County
with the interest and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes
are collected.
   (i)   The charges or rental shall be collected by the Water Department.
   (j)   The funds received from the collection of the charges or rentals
authorized by this section shall be deposited daily with the Municipal Treasury
and shall be accounted for and be known as the Sewer System Revenue Fund, and
when appropriated by Council, shall be available for the payment of the cost
and expense of the management, maintenance and repair of the Municipal sewerage
system and sewage pumping, treatment and disposal works, and any surplus in
such fund shall be used for the payment of the interest on bonds issued and
outstanding or which may be issued to provide funds with which to pay the
Municipality's portion of the cost of constructing such sewerage system, or
part thereof, and to retire such bonds when they mature, and/or for the
enlargement or replacement of the sewerage system.
(Ord. 845. Passed 12-3-73.)
   (k)   No lot, parcel of land, building or premises now or hereinafter used
by the Municipality for municipal purposes, shall be subject to the sewer
charges provided in this chapter; nor shall any water supplied by the Municipal
waterworks for extinguishing fires, cleaning fire apparatus and waste
collection trucks or furnishing or supplying water to fire hydrants be used to
determine any sewer charge as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 465. Passed 1-17-66.)
921.16 CONNECTION TO ANNEXATIONS.
   (a)   All subdividers and owners of property outside the Municipality
desiring to be annexed to the Municipality and desiring to be supplied with
water by the Municipality, are hereby required to provide for sanitary sewage
disposal in accordance with the plans and specifications of the Municipal
Engineer. Such sewage disposal plans shall provide for the use of the existing
sewage system now owned and operated by the Municipality unless the cost of
providing sanitary sewage disposal and connections with the central system
would be extremely excessive.
   (b)   Each subdivider or property owner required to use the central sewage
system of the Municipality shall pay for the cost of the construction of such
sanitary sewer to one of the main lines of the central sewage system and shall
further be assessed a tap-in charge for each and every lot using the sewage
system.
(Ord. 465. Passed 1-17-66.)
921.17 SPECIAL RATES.
   (a)   Over and above the charges established by Section
921.14 there may be established in special instances and upon special agreement
between the Municipality and the owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises
served by the system, such additional charges for industrial wastes of unusual
strength or composition which are accepted by the Municipality for treatment as
may be determined to be fair and equitable.
   (b)   Each such special agreement and the charges established thereby shall
not become effective until ratified by ordinance duly passed by Council.
(Ord. 465. Passed 1-17-66.)
921.18 OWNERS AND TENANT JOINTLY LIABLE.
   (a)   Each charge for sewer services is made a lien upon the corresponding
lot, parcel of land, building or premises served by a connection to the system
of the Municipality. Such lien shall vest when such charge becomes due and
payable and, if the same is not paid within ninety days after it becomes due
and payable it shall be certified to the County Auditor and the Auditor shall
place the same on the tax duplicate of the County with the interest and
penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes.
   (b)   The owners of real estate premises installing or maintaining sewer
service shall be liable for all charges incurred for service at the premises.
Unless the premises is equipped with individual water shut-offs for each unit,
owners of real estate shall be required to contract with the Municipality for
all sewer accounts at the premises. Individual shut-offs must be either outside
of the premises or at an inside location that is accessible by the Municipality
at all times. In the event that shut-offs are at an inside location, it shall
be the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the shut-offs are accessible
by the Municipality without prior notice to the owner.
(Ord. 2513. Passed 4-15-02.)
   (c)   Tenants of the owners of real estate premises may contract with the
Municipality for such sewer service but such contract shall be in no way
construed as to relieve the owner of the real estate premises of liability for
service charges.
   (d)   After certifying to the County Auditor that charges are unpaid and a
lien as provided herein the Safety-Service Director is authorized and directed
to shut off the water service to those real estate premises until such unpaid
charges have been paid. However, before any service is disconnected the owner
shall have the opportunity for a hearing before Council, which may stay or
permit such shut off. The owner of real estate premises by installing or
maintaining sewer service from the Municipality is deemed to assent to all
rules, regulations and ordinances of the Municipality pertaining to sewer
service and distribution.
   (e)   The Municipality may require a deposit of one hundred dollars
($100.00) prior to providing sewerage services to any property owner or tenant
where there have been past delinquencies or shut offs.
921.19 TAMPERING.
   No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part
of the sewerage system.
921.20 DISCHARGE OF CHEMICALS INTO STORM SEWER SYSTEM PROHIBITED.
   No person shall dump, drain or discharge into the storm sewer system of this
City any chemicals, including but not limited to motor oil, gasoline, diesel
oil, fuel oil, automotive coolant, transmission fluid, solvents, grease, paint,
paint thinner or brush cleaner, turpentine, or any other hazardous, flammable
or corrosive liquid or substance.
(Ord. 2631. Passed 11-8-04.)
921.21 REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE CONNECTIONS TO THE SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that all sewers,
including all public and private sewers and all connections to them, are
managed, operated and maintained to:
      (1)   Maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of conveyance and
treatment facilities;
      (2)   Minimize the probability, duration, and magnitude of overflows;
      (3)   Eliminate the infiltration of storm water.
   (b)   Acceptable Practices for Connections. No water from downspouts,
areaways, cisterns, or the ground surface shall be permitted to enter the
sanitary sewer system. The elevation of basement and garage floors shall be
designed so storm water cannot enter the sanitary sewer system.
      (1)   Grades with Footer Drains. The finished grade adjacent to all
houses or structures with footer drains shall not be less than a six-inch fall
in the first ten feet horizontally. Where the horizontal distance is restricted
to less than ten feet by property lines, the minimum fall shall be six inches.
      (2)   Grades without Footer Drains. The finished grade adjacent to all
houses or structures without footer drains shall not be less than a six-inch
fall in the first ten feet horizontally. Where the horizontal distance is
restricted to less than ten feet by property lines, the minimum fall shall be
three inches.
      (3)   Yard Drainage. Positive yard drainage shall be provided for each
lot by means of ditches, swales or tile to natural watercourses or to public
storm sewers. Where a lot is graded to a higher or lower level than the natural
ground grade on an adjacent property, the owner of the lot shall provide
suitable slopes, retaining walls or other protection on his property to
preserve the natural slope or surface elevation of the adjacent property.
Maximum slope shall be not greater than fourteen percent, unless approval is
obtained from the Village Administrator or Village Engineer.
      (4)   Roof and Footer Drains. Roof drainage shall be handled by suitable
collectors and downspouts, which must discharge into storm sewers when
available. If storm sewers are not available, downspouts must discharge on
suitable splash blocks to conduct water three feet from the foundation,
provided the yard slope does not exceed one and one-half percent grade. If the
slope of the yard exceeds one and one-half percent grade, and suitable storm
sewers are not available, roof drainage shall be tiled from the downspouts to a
curb opening at the street or shall be tiled to a natural watercourse. No
concentration of water shall flow onto the adjoining property. Where drainage
is to the front of lots, the top of the basement wall shall be not less than
twenty inches above sidewalk grade.
      (5)   Splash Blocks. If splash blocks are used, the water shall be
directed from the downspouts by means of an elbow to the splash block.
      (6)   Storm Drain Tile. If storm drain tile is used, the downspout shall
discharge into sewer pipe not less than four inches in diameter, from a point
not less than six inches above finish grade to an elbow below finish grade, and
discharge into the storm sewer connection. The sewer shall be of an approved
material, and all joints shall be sealed. The elbow shall be securely blocked
up with masonry or braced to the wall with non-corrosive hangars, to prevent
settlement.
   (c)   Foundation Drains.
      (1)   In any area served by sanitary sewers, foundation drain sump pumps
shall discharge to surface drainage, a storm sewer, a storm water detention or
retention basin, or any other location that is approved by the Village of
Crestline and is not a sanitary sewer or tributary to a sanitary sewer.
         A.   A foundation drain sump pump may not discharge to a combined
sewer at any site that is served by a separate storm water conveyance system.
         B.   Foundation drains connected to a sanitary or combined sewer
before January 2008 may remain connected, unless inspection requires
disconnection to reduce inflow. If a foundation drain was connected to a
combined sewer before the construction of a storm sewer that serves the
property, then the foundation drain may remain connected to the combined sewer,
unless the Village of Crestline requires disconnection to reduce inflow.
      (2)   For structures constructed after December 31, 2008, foundation
drain sump pumps shall discharge through a verifiable external pipe.
   (d)   Inspections.
      (1)   The Village of Crestline shall conduct inspections for prohibited
connections whenever the Village has a reasonable suspicion that:
         A.   Prohibited connections are likely to be causing or contributing
to excessive inflow in a particular sanitary sewer, or
         B.   A particular prohibited connection is connected to a sanitary
sewer line contrary to the requirements of this section.
      (2)   An inspection plan and schedule may include: inspecting within a
certain time, every structure within a particular sewer or a representative
sample of these structures; inspecting structures at the time of sale; or
inspecting structures as a condition of receiving a building permit.
      (3)   Before inspections occur, the Village of Crestline shall provide
notice to both the owners and the occupants of the structures to be inspected.
This notice shall indicate the range of dates and times when the inspection may
occur and the reasons for the inspection.
      (4)   The scope of the inspection shall be limited to determining whether
connections comply with the Ohio Building Code 2007, this section, and any
other related requirements of the Village.
      (5)   The owner or occupant of any structure shall allow the Village of
Crestline to inspect sewer connections and any related piping at any reasonable
time after receiving notice from the Village of Crestline of its plans to
perform inspections, according to the requirements of this section and any
other applicable law.
   (e)   Prohibited Connection Enforcement.
      (1)   If the Village of Crestline possesses any credible evidence showing
that a connection is in violation as outlined, then the Village shall notify
both the owner and the occupant of the structure of the violation and require
remedial action.
      (2)   The Village of Crestline shall allow a reasonable length of time to
complete the remedial action and advise the owner and occupant in writing. The
length of time to remediate the violation shall be set by the Village
Administrator based upon the complexity of the repair.
      (3)   If the owner or occupant of a structure does not consent to an
inspection undertaken according to the requirements as set forth above, then
the Village of Crestline shall cease providing water, sewer service or other
municipal services to that structure or take other effective action. The
Village shall terminate these services according to any applicable requirements
of the Villages Codified Ordinances and any other applicable requirements.
   (f)   Submerged Manholes. If a sanitary sewer manhole is in a 100-year
floodplain or is submerged for significant periods by storm water runoff, then
the manhole shall have a solid and non-vented cover and the portion subject to
freeze and thaw cycles shall be sealed to effectively prevent infiltration.
   (g)   Inconsistent Provisions Repealed. All ordinances, rules and
regulations inconsistent with the provisions of this section are hereby
repealed.
   (h)   Violations. Whoever violates subsections (b) or (c) hereof and fails
to remediate the violation in the time provided under subsection (e) shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition, the Village may seek
an injunction or pursue an action in Common Pleas Court to abate any nuisance
caused by the violation.
(Ord. 2974. Passed 9-12-11.)
921.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter except Section
921.19 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each day on which a violation occurs
or continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates Sections
921.19 or
921.20 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. (Ord. 2631. Passed
11-8-04.)

Safety-Service Director.
 
   (f)   When a service connection is found to have deteriorated to the extent
that permanent repairs cannot be made, a new service shall be required to be

further notice.
 
   (g)   Water service between the curb stop and the meter must be maintained
at the expense of the property owner. Service pipe between the main and the

   (a)   The Village Administrator or his authorized subordinates shall have
access at all reasonable times to the premises supplied with water for the
purpose of reading meters and to see that all rules are observed or to make any
necessary examination of plumbing and water fixtures. In case the meter is not
accessible in a reasonable length of time, the service may be discontinued
until a reading is obtained and bill paid.
   (b)   Meters shall be furnished by the Municipality up to and including two-
inch meters and shall be set, removed or adjusted by their employees only. The
location of the meter must be provided by the consumer so that the meter can be
set in place without disturbing any of the water piping. Any alterations
required to conform with this shall be done by and at the expense of the
consumer. Meters shall not be installed in coal bins, or other inaccessible
places.
   (c)   On property where there is no cellar or basement a suitable place for
a meter must be provided inside the building, provided that existing meter
boxes or meter vaults will be permitted in lieu of a suitable place inside the
building.
   (d)   If a meter installed on the premises is stolen, damaged by freezing,
fire, hot water or any other way due to the neglect of the consumer or property
owner, the cost of repairs or replacement shall be paid by the property owner
or consumer.
   (e)   If the Village Administrator finds that a meter seal has been tampered
with or broken or any by-pass inserted and there is evidence that the meter has

established by the Village Administrator.
   (i)   There shall be charged to each user the sum of ten dollars ($10.00)
for such installation of an outside reading device. Unless requested in writing
by the user, such ten dollars ($10.00) shall be added to the next following
water billing. The type of reading device and the means of installation shall
be determined by the Village Administrator.
(Ord. 1789. Passed 10-2-89.)
925.05 BILLINGS.
   (a)   All water and sewage bills not paid by the fifth of the month shall be
subject to a ten percent (10%) penalty. When bills are not paid by the
twentieth, service shall be disconnected and fifty dollars ($50.00) charged to
turn same on.
   (b)   Accounts for water service must be paid in the order in which they are
contracted. Accordingly, payment of current accounts will not be accepted until
all prior accounts for the same premises have been paid. In the event that the
user of water owes for water not used on the premises, then the Municipality at
its option may apply the payment to any account owed by the user.
   (c)   When water service has been discontinued by request of the consumer or
for nonpayment of bills, or for any other reason set forth herein, a charge of
fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be made to restore the service.

estimated from the Municipality's record of a period when water was supplied
under similar conditions, or based on the records of a similar use. (Ord. 2363.
Passed 2-15-99; Ord. 3302. Passed 4-18-22.)
925.06 WATER TESTING.
   The Municipality will on deposit of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) test a
meter. If the meter is found to over-register by an amount exceeding three
percent (3%), another meter will be furnished and proper reduction made on the
water bill and the deposit will be refunded. If the meter does not over-
register by an amount exceeding three percent (3%), the deposit shall not be
refunded and the bill must be paid as rendered.
925.07 WATER SERVICES AND FEES.

(Ord. 3324. Passed 12-5-22.)
   (c)   The Water Department is hereby authorized and directed to charge
accredited public and parochial schools and school facilities a discounted
water rate that is seventeen percent (17%) of the “Inside city regular rates”
of this section. (Ord. 2939. Passed 12-27-10.)
   (d)   That effective April 1, 2006, there shall be assessed a surcharge in
addition to the rates specified in Section
925.08 on those water customers located outside of the City who are served by a
private water line running through a City Master water meter. This surcharge
shall be computed as follows:
There shall be subtracted from the total number of cubic feet of water measured
by the Master meter the sum of the total cubic feet of water measured by all
individual meters served by this line and the result shall then be divided by
the number of individual water customers served by this line and added as water
consumed by that customer at the rate set forth in the regular rate schedule.
(Ord. 2697. Passed 1-23-06.)
925.09 OWNERS AND TENANT JOINTLY LIABLE.
   (a)   Each charge for water services is made a lien upon the corresponding
lot, parcel of land, building or premises served by a connection to the system
of the Municipality. Such lien shall vest when such charge becomes due and
payable and, if the same is not paid within ninety days after it becomes due
and payable it shall be certified to the County Auditor and the Auditor shall
place the same on the tax duplicate of the County with the interest and
penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes. (A.O.)
   (b)   The owners of real estate premises installing or maintaining water
service shall be liable for all charges incurred for service at the premises.
Unless the premises is equipped with individual water shut-offs for each unit,
owners of real estate shall be required to contract with the Municipality for
all water accounts at the premises. Individual shut-offs must be either outside
of the premises or at an inside location that is accessible by the Municipality
at all times. In the event that shut-offs are at an inside location, it shall
be the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the shut-offs are accessible
by the Municipality without prior notice to the owner.
(Ord. 2513. Passed 4-15-02.)
   (c)   Tenants of the owners of real estate premises may contract with the
Municipality for such water service but such contract shall be in no way
construed as to relieve the owner of the real estate premises of liability for
service charges.
   (d)   After certifying to the County Auditor that charges are unpaid and a
lien as provided herein, the Village Administrator is authorized and directed
to shut off the water service to those real estate premises until such unpaid
charges have been paid. However, before any service is disconnected the owner
shall have the opportunity for a hearing before Council, which may stay or
permit such shut off. The owner of real estate premises by installing or
maintaining water service from the Municipality is deemed to assent to all
rules, regulations and ordinances of the Municipality pertaining to water
service and distribution.
925.10 PRIVATE WATER CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   No consumer shall have a private water supply connected in series with the
water system supplied by the Municipality regardless if valves are supplied for
shut-off of either system. In other words, if the consumer desires to keep the
present water system, it must be completely separate from the system being
supplied by the Municipality. If any consumer is found to be in violation of
this rule, the water supply to his premises will be shut off immediately and
shall not be turned on again until the private supply is disconnected or
separated. A charge of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be made for turning on the
water.

   (a)   Any extensions of main water lines other than in subdivisions shall
not be less than six inches in diameter and shall include fire hydrants.
   (b)   Such lines, as well as all fittings and other appurtenances shall meet
the American Water Works Association standards, and shall be installed in
accordance with plans and specifications submitted to and approved by the
Municipality. Upon completion of the extension paid bills covering the
installation costs shall be filed with the Municipality.
   (c)   None of the foregoing shall be construed as preventing the
Municipality from extending their main water lines where they deem it necessary
to eliminate dead ends or improve fire flows, nor to preclude methods provided
for by petition and assessment and/or otherwise by request of property owners.
925.13 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE TO NONRESIDENT.
   (a)   The Municipality reserves the right to discontinue water service to
consumers outside the corporation at any time, should they deem it necessary to
conserve water for consumers within the corporation.
   (b)   Any new lines in new subdivisions or parts thereof, must have nothing
less than six-inch cast iron water lines or larger.
925.14 SALE OF WATER OUTSIDE MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   The following policy is hereby adopted regulating the sale of water to
areas outside the corporate limits of the Municipality.
      (1)   Whenever the Planning Commission recommends to Council that for
purposes of the controlled and orderly growth of the environs of the
Municipality, it is desirable that water rights be granted to new subdivisions
or areas not within the corporate limits of the Municipality and which are not
deemed advisable to annex at that time or in the immediate future, Council
shall consider such recommendations, each on its own merits, and without being
bound by other provisions of this section.
      (2)    Other than subsection (a)(2) hereof or deemed by Council, water
rights so granted are on the condition that the applicants and users of such
water rights and water shall agree and incorporate in their deed conveying any
of the area so affected, appropriate covenants binding upon the grantees, their
heirs and assigns forever, to agree to annexation to the Municipality at any
time the Municipality indicates it desires for annexation, and to do whatever
is necessary to accomplish such result.
         (Ord. 3123. Passed 8-24-15.)
   (b)   In areas outside the corporate limits where water service is now being
furnished by the Municipality from existing water lines, the following policy
shall apply:

   (a)   No person shall enter a claim for damage against the Municipality or
any officer thereof, for damage to any pipe, fixture or appurtenance by reason
of interrupted water supply, or variation of pressure, or for damage of any
nature whatsoever caused by the turning off, or turning on, either wholly or
partially, of the water supply for the extension, alteration or repair of any
water main or premise supply, or for the discontinuance of the premise water
supply for the violation of any rule or regulation contained in or authorized
by this chapter.
 
   (b)   No claims shall be allowed against the Municipality, on account of the
interruption of the water supply caused by the breaking of pipes or machinery,

the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water consumer to install
an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the
Safety- Service Director and/or the Superintendent of Water and shall have
inspections and tests made of such approved devices as required by the Safety-
Service Director and/or the Superintendent of Water.
 
   (c)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public

municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Safety- Service Director and/or the Superintendent of Water and by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
 
   (d)   It shall be the duty of the Safety-Service Director and/or the
Superintendent of Water to cause surveys and investigations to be made of

investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated as
often as the Safety-Service Director and/or the Superintendent of Water shall
deem necessary.
 
   (e)   The Safety-Service Director and/or the Superintendent of Water or

piping system or systems thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of
any property so served shall furnish to the Safety-Service Director and/or the
Superintendent of Water any information which they may request regarding the
piping system or systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Safety-Service

         (Ord. 2787. Passed 11-26-07.)
929.03 SITE PLANNING AND DESIGN.
   These procedures will help in the preparation of a Stormwater Management/
Sediment Control Plan (SWM/SCP) that will meet the requirements of this chapter
and State NPDES Stormwater Permits. These guidelines are not intended to be
all-inclusive or to address all possible situations.
   (a)   Configure the site layout to maintain as much of the existing natural
drainage system as possible.
      (1)   Where increased conveyance and improved drainage is needed, do not
create new ditches or enclose waterways in pipe, but instead apply stream
channel restoration or construction practices to increase capacity.
      (2)   Improve existing ditches or other extensively degraded channels by
re-establishing riparian buffers and in-stream restoration practices.
   (b)   Scrutinize every possible way to minimize the amount of impervious
surface to be created.
      (1)   Cluster developments to the extent possible.
      (2)   Minimize street widths and lengths, minimize off-street parking to
the extent required by Zoning or Subdivision Regulations, and use modular
paving bricks, or other similar pervious surfaces rather than concrete or
asphalt for non-traffic areas.
   (c)   Design the on-site drainage system to be stable for the design storm.
This should include roadside ditches, storm sewers, retention/detention basins,
outlet pipes, etc. (See Section
929.04(h) for design storm criteria.)
   (d)   Manage concentrated stormwater flows to minimize soil erosion/
sedimentation.
      (1)   Minimize the amount of the worksite that will be disturbed, staging
construction if at all possible to limit the area of clearing, grading and
excavation.
      (2)   Preserve trees, buffer strips of natural vegetation along streams,
and provide temporary seeding on disturbed areas as quickly as possible.
   (e)   Design sediment control structures that should be put in place in the
first stages of development for control of erosion and sedimentation during and
after construction. Sediment ponds should be the first priority structure for
drainage areas of five (5) acres or more of disturbed areas. Silt fences and/or
straw bales may be used to control sheet flow run-off. Measures shall be taken
to eliminate sedimentation of storm sewers, catch basins, manholes and similar
structures. These should be protected by the use of filter insert devices,
stone dikes or other acceptable techniques. Developers shall refer to the
publication "Rainwater and Land Development", published by the Ohio Dept. of
Natural Resources Div. of Soil and Water Conservation, Fountain Square Court,
Columbus, Ohio.
      (Ord. 2787. Passed 11-26-07.)
929.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Design Requirements. These regulations shall apply to any earth-
disturbing activity where more than 20,000 square feet of soil is disturbed,
including residential, commercial or industrial development as well as non-
structural activities such as pond construction, logging operations, site
clearing and grubbing, etc.
      (1)   These regulations shall not apply to the construction of a single-
family residential structure disturbing less than 20,000 square feet, on a lot
which is not included in a Stormwater Management or Sediment Control Plan for a
larger development. However, the owner of record for the property on which the
construction will take place shall provide a letter of agreement wherein the
owner states that appropriate sediment control measures will be utilized to
minimize soil erosion and off-site sedimentation.
      (2)   For all other residential, commercial, industrial or non-structural
earth-disturbing activities where more than 20,000 square feet of soil will be
disturbed during construction, the owner of the property shall develop a
Stormwater Management and Sediment Control Plan, prepared in accordance with
subsection (l) hereof. The plan shall contain sufficient detailed information,
drawings and explanations to accurately describe the methods to be employed to
manage stormwater run-off, soil erosion and off-site sedimentation, during and
after construction. No earth- disturbing activities shall begin prior to the
approval of this plan by the Stormwater Manager.
      (3)   The Stormwater Manager shall be notified at least 48 hours in
advance of any earth-disturbing activity for which a Stormwater Management and
Sediment Control Plan is required. The Stormwater Manager shall also be advised
when all earth-disturbing activities have been completed.
   (b)   Protection of Adjacent Properties. Properties adjacent to the
construction site shall be protected from erosion or flooding as a result of
earth-disturbing activity or construction on a site. This may be accomplished
by a Stormwater Management/Sediment Control Plan (SWM/SCP) that may incorporate
a well-vegetated buffer strip at the lower parameter of the property, and run-
off control structures such as detention/retention ponds, sediment basins,
filter strips, sediment control fences, or a combination of such devices.
   (c)   Installation of Sediment Control. Sediment basins and traps, diversion
dikes, sediment fences or other similar measures intended to trap sediment on-
site shall be constructed as a first step in the excavation/grading process,
and shall be made functional before any up-slope land disturbance occurs.
Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversion structures shall be
seeded or mulched within seven (7) days, weather permitting. Slopes that are
later found to be eroding excessively shall receive additional stabilization
treatments during construction until the erosion/sedimentation problem is
corrected.
   (d)   Sediment Basins. Where five (5) or more acres of land will be subject
to earth- disturbing activity within a single watershed, stormwater from that
watershed shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment
trapping structure with storage capacity adequate for the calculated run-off
from that drainage area. The Stormwater Manager may require that sediment
basins be constructed in smaller drainage areas where deemed necessary, due to
soil conditions, topography, or other conditions on a site. Unless otherwise
designated, sediment basins are considered to be temporary, and shall be
removed following final stabilization of the site.
   (e)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection. All storm sewer inlets, catch basins,
sanitary sewer manholes, field tile drops, and similar man-made conduits that
are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sediment-laden
water will not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or
otherwise treated to eliminate sediment.
   (f)   Cut and Fill Slope Protection. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed
and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be
given to the length and degree of slope, soil type, up-slope drainage areas and
other applicable conditions. Slopes that are found to be eroding excessively
during construction shall be provided with additional slope stabilizing
measures as recommended by the Stormwater Manager until the problem is
corrected. The following guidelines are provided as a guide:
      (1)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferable to smooth surfaces
on slopes.
      (2)   Diversions shall be constructed at the top of long and/or steep
slopes. Terraces may also be used to reduce the length of slopes.
      (3)   Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down a cut or
fill slope unless contained within an adequate re-enforced channel, flume or
slope drain structure.
      (4)   Whenever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane that endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection shall be
provided.
   (g)   Working in or Crossing Watercourses. Construction equipment and
vehicles should be kept out of watercourses whenever possible. Where a live
(wet) watercourse must be crossed regularly by construction vehicles, a
temporary culvert or other approved vehicular stream-crossing structure may be
required. Where in- channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during and after construction to minimize erosion.
Permits for channel work may be required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
perform in-stream channel projects.
   (h)   Stormwater Run-off Calculations. To prevent damages from downstream
properties from accelerated stormwater run-off, a stormwater management plan
shall describe methods that will be used to reduce both the volume and rate of
run-off to pre-development rates.
      (1)   The peak discharge rate from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not exceed
the peak discharge rate of run-off from a one (1) year frequency, 24 hour storm
occurring on the same drainage area under pre- development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm up to the 100 year storm have peak run-off discharge rates no
greater than the peak run-off rates from equivalent storms under pre-
development conditions. Consideration of the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 year
storms will be considered adequate in designing to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The critical storms for a specific drainage area shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   Run-off shall be calculated using the Natural Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS) TR-55 Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, to
determine the total volume (acre-feet) of run-off from a one (1) year, 24 hour
storm occurring on the development site drainage area before and after
development.
         B.   From the volumes determined in subsection (h)(3)A. above,
determine the percent increase in volume of run-off due to development, and
then select the critical storm from the following table:
If the percentage of increase in volume of run-off is:
Equal to or   Less than: The critical storm
greater than:            will be
--            10         1 year
10            20         2 year
20            50         5 year
50            100        10 year
100           250        25 year
250           500        50 year
500           --         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre-development and post-
development run-off volume for one (1) year storm is 35%, the critical storm is
a five (5) year storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to
this frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate
from the one (1) year frequency storm under pre- development conditions in the
development drainage area. The post- development run-off from all less frequent
storms need only be controlled to meet the pre-development peak discharge rate
for each of those same storms.
      (4)   Methods for controlling increases in the rate and volume of
stormwater run-off may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction. For example,
using grass-lined road ditches, rather than paved street gutters where
practical, and discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-
lined drainage channels.
         B.   Grading and construction of terraces or diversions to slow run-
off by diffusion, or use of grade control structures, such as check dams, to
provide a level of control in flow paths and/or existing drainage ways.
         C.   Induced infiltration of increased stormwater run-off into the
soil where practical. For example, constructing special infiltration areas
where soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be re-vegetated,
or providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
         D.   Provisions for detention and retention of stormwater, with
properly designed retention basins being preferred. For example, utilizing
permanent ponds and lakes as stormwater retention basins that provide multiple
use areas for stormwater detention, recreation, wildlife, fire protection and
aesthetics. Constructed wetlands, dry detention basins or subsurface storage
areas are other options.
   (i)   Permit Processing. All applications for Stormwater Management Permits
shall be filed with the Stormwater Manager prior to the start of any earth-
disturbing activity. The Stormwater Manager shall have 30 days to review such
applications, and shall approve, approve with corrections and modifications, or
disapprove the permit. If the permit is not approved, the Stormwater Manager
shall submit comments, drawings or other material to explain why the permit
could not be approved. Permits that are granted may fall into one (1) of the
following categories:
      (1)   Approved Without Further Action. (Letter of No Interest/Regulations
not Applicable.)
      (2)   Approved - Sediment Control Agreement Required. Owner of record
shall submit a letter of agreement regarding intent and methodology to control
silt and sedimentation from on- site erosion.
      (3)   Approved - Sediment Control Plan is Required.
      (4)   Permit Denied.
   (j)   Letter of Agreement. For small projects disturbing less than 20,000
square feet, or projects where stormwater run-off and soil erosion can be
reasonably contained within the project site, a simple letter of agreement may
be provided by the developer indicating his intention and the methods that will
be employed to control stormwater run-off and sediment migration during
construction. The terms and conditions of this agreement shall be at the
discretion of the Stormwater Manager.
   (k)   Residential Dwellings on Individual Lots.
      (1)   For residential lots in subdivisions for which there is an approved
Stormwater Management/Sediment Control Plan no SWM/SCP permit shall be required
unless the builder/developer proposes to modify the previously approved plan.
      (2)   On lots less than 20,000 square feet, the property owner and/or
contractor shall follow these minimal standards for construction of single-
family homes on lots within subdivisions for which a previously approved SWM/
SCP exists.

construction sites are disturbed. Pre- existing vegetation shall be preserved
on other areas of the subdivision for as long as possible.
         C.   Temporary seeding (annual rye, oats, etc.) and/or mulch shall be
applied to bare areas that will not be worked within the next 30 days.
         D.   Stockpiles of soil shall be stabilized or protected with sediment
trapping measures such as straw bales, silt fences, etc.

large gravel shall be installed at the beginning of the excavation process to
reduce mud from the site from tracking into the street. (Size #4-6 stone or
larger is recommended.)
         I.   Mud and sediment that accumulates in the street or along gutters
or in ditches shall be removed daily. Sediment/mud shall be removed by scraping
or shoveling. Flushing of sediment into catch basins or drains is not
permitted.
         J.   Downspouts should be drained across the surface of the property
whenever possible.

         I.   A plan review and filing fee as specified by the City of
Crestline.
   (m)   Stormwater Manager Plan Review.
      (1)   The Stormwater Management and Sediment Control (SWM/SCP) shall be
submitted to the Stormwater Manager. No construction shall commence until the
final plan has been approved by the Stormwater Manager.
      (2)   Within 30 days of receipt of a SWM/SCP, the Stormwater Manager
shall convey to the owner, or his appointed representative, the plan's status,
as to its compliance or non-compliance. A ruling of noncompliance shall include
specific plan deficiencies, as well as the procedures for filing a revised
plan.
      (3)   At the time a revised plan is submitted, a new 30-day period
begins. All approved plans shall remain valid for one (1) year from date of
approval.
   (n)   Inspection and Compliance. If, in the opinion of the Stormwater
Manager, immediate and irreparable damage will occur, because of a violation,
he/she may take appropriate action to seek a correction of the problem without
delay. Enforcement action shall proceed as follows:
      (1)   Issuance of a letter detailing the nature of the violation, with a
notice to correct within 48 hours.
      (2)   If no response is indicated, a stop work order shall be issued.
      (3)   If a violation does exist, and no corrective action is taken by the

appropriate relief, in order to abate excessive erosion, or sedimentation, and
thereby secure compliance with these regulations. In granting relief, the court
may order construction of sediment control improvements, or the implementation
of other control measures.
      (4)   A final inspection will then be made, to determine if the criteria
of these regulations has been satisfied, with a final report sent to the
Stormwater Manager, relevant to the status of compliance, or non-compliance.
   (o)   Variance. A duly appointed Appeals Board may grant a variance to these
regulations, whenever an owner, or his appointed representative, can show
evidence that a hardship exists, whereby compliance with these regulations is
not appropriate, based upon the following:
      (1)   That exceptional and/or unusual topographic or other physical
conditions exist that are peculiar to this particular parcel of land.
      (2)   That the peculiar conditions, noted in paragraph (o)(1) above, did
not result from any previous actions by the owner.
      (3)   That such a literal interpretation of these regulations would
deprive the owner of rights that are enjoyed by other property owners.
   PLEASE NOTE: Adverse economic conditions shall not be considered a valid
reason, or hardship, for a variance request to be granted. No variances will be
granted, where activities occur, that would defeat the purpose of these
regulations. Requests for a variance should be submitted to the Stormwater
Manager, stating the specific variances being sought, and including sufficient
data to justify the granting of such variances.

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
      The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval. (OBC

deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.

rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities.
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio

search warrant whenever an owner refuses to permit a warrantless inspection of

vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal administrative costs stated
above.

   (b)   The owner of a vacant commercial building shall pay an annual fee of
four hundred ($400) dollars for the first year the building remains vacant. For
every consecutive year that the building remains vacant, the annual fee will be

equaling the five (5) year fee of six thousand four hundred ($6,400) dollars to
be used for the fifth and for all consecutive subsequent years of vacancy.

1322.07 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   A building under active construction/renovation and having a valid
building permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall be exempt from
registration until the expiration of the longest running, currently active
building permit.
   (b)   A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by extreme
weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a

1325.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control
measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Crestline has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Crestline as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Crestline.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Crawford County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, and Flood Insurance Rate Map Crawford County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, both effective January 19, 2011.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: NONE
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Crestline as required by Section
1325.04(c).
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Administration Building, 100 North
Seltzer Street, Crestline, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Crestline, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2938.
Passed 12-13-10.)
1325.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,

equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Crestline’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Crestline’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map, October 5, 1984, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent(1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2938. Passed 12-13-10.)

      (2)   Approval. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required. The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Crestline’s flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1325.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.  
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1325.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Crestline, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Crestline have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Crestline’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Crestline’s boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Crestline suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Crestline has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1325.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section

      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Crestline specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1325.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order,
or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or
for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  
      (1)   Any person believing that the use and development standards of
these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application
for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
         A.   Application for a Variance.
            1.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance
is sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
            2.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         B.   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
         C.   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(1)C.1. to 11.have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief (or his official
designee) in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen

insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or insureds
have submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. Such transfer of
proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies insuring the building or
