ARTICLE III
THE COUNCIL
SECTION 3.01 COMPOSITION OF COUNCIL, TERMS OF OFFICE.
   (a)   At the regular municipal election held in 1979, three electors from
the City at large shall be elected as At Large members of the Council to terms
of office of two years each; and four electors of the City residing in their
respective wards shall be elected as Ward members of the Council from the wards
existing under the general statutory plan of government at the time of their
election to terms of office of four years each.
   (b)   At the regular municipal election held in 1981, three electors from
the City at large shall be elected as At Large members of the Council to serve
four year terms of office.
   (c)   At the regular municipal election held in 1983, and every four years

four year terms of office.

SECTION 3.02 WARD BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   The ward boundaries existing on the date for filing as a candidate for
office of a Ward Council member for election at the regular municipal election
held in 1979 shall apply to such election. Thereafter, the ward boundaries
shall be established by the Council or the Ward Boundary Commission, as
appropriate, in a manner that will allow and facilitate the election of Ward
Council members as provided in Division (c) of Section 3.01 of this Charter.
   (b)   There is hereby created a Ward Boundary Commission consisting of five
electors of the City to serve overlapping terms of office of four years each,
provided that the first members of the Commission under this Charter shall be
appointed so that three members serve a term of four years each and two members
serve a term of two years each. Members of the Commission shall be appointed by
a majority vote of the members of Council. At appointment, no more than two
members shall be adherents of the same political party. No more than two
electors from any ward shall be members of the Commission and each ward shall
be represented.
(Amended 11-6-07)
   (c)   Following each decennial census, and at least ninety days prior to the
date candidates for Ward Council seats must file for office for the second
regular municipal election after the decennial census, the Commission shall
propose the redivision of the City into four wards of substantially equal
population in each ward, by the preparation of an ordinance or resolution,
approved as to form by the City Attorney, and file such proposal with the Clerk
of Council. The Council shall either pass the ordinance or resolution in the
form submitted by the Commission or reject, by a two-thirds vote of the
Council, the Commission's proposal within thirty days after it is filed with
the Clerk. If the ordinance or resolution is passed by Council, it shall be
effective immediately, shall not be subject to veto by the Mayor, but shall be
subject to initiative or referendum under this Charter. If the Council shall
reject the Commission's proposal the Ward Boundary Commission shall, by a two-
thirds vote of its members, make an appropriate redivision of the City's wards
within sixty days after the Commission's proposal was filed with the Clerk.
Such action by the Commission shall be in the form of an ordinance or
resolution, shall be effective immediately, shall not be subject to veto by the
Mayor, but shall be subject to initiative or referendum under this Charter.
   (d)   In addition to the redivision of the City into wards following each
decennial census as required by Division (c) of this Section, the Council may,
by motion direct the Ward Boundary Commission to redivide the City into four
wards in order to provide substantially equal population in each ward, and the
procedures set forth in Division (c) of this Section shall apply.
   (e)   All wards shall be compact and contiguous and shall be bounded, as far
as practical, by county lines, streets, alleys, avenues, public grounds,

remainder of the unexpired term. The Clerk of Council shall cause a notice of
such special election to be published on the same day of each week for two
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of circulation in the City. Candidates for the

Ward Council member, only the electors of the ward shall be entitled to vote at
the election. A person who has been removed by recall shall not be either a
candidate or appointed by the Mayor to succeed himself or herself, but such

for office in other future elections.

(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation continues or occurs.

certify the names of all candidates having the highest rating, and the
appointing authority shall appoint the toe rated person within thirty days from
the date of such certification; beginning at the top of the list, each time a
selection is made, it shall be from the top candidate remaining on the list who

160.08   ADMINISTRATION OF PAY PLAN.
   (a)   Salary Schedule and Pay Grades.
      (1)   Effective January 1, 2021 the City will update the step program for
non-bargaining unit employees in pay grades 1 through 15 in non-supervisory
roles as reflected in Section 160.03(a). Effective January 1, 2021, any
adjustments in step assignments will be made at the discretion of the
Appointing Authority to fall in line with the new step program being
implemented. Effective January 1, 2023, each employee will then move through
their steps on their anniversary date of each year that falls on years that end
in odd numbers. Effective January 1, 2022 and each January 1 thereafter the
scale will adjust by two percent (2%) each year.
      (2)   The Appointing Authority will determine what step an individual is
assigned based upon the qualification at the time of the initial hiring/
transfer/promotion. In the event an individual does not meet expectations on
their annual review, moving to the next step could be delayed. Any employee not
meeting performance standards will be notified of a delay of the step increase
by six (6)-months. At the six (6)-month mark there will be another evaluation
of performance and if the employee meets the performance standards, they will

recommendation of one of the following findings for each allegation:
         A.   Sustained: Preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct occurred and the officer's actions were inconsistent with
law or the Division of Police policy, procedure, or training. A complaint may
be "sustained in part" if the investigation revealed sufficient evidence to
support a finding of a policy violation on one (1) or more, but not all of the
complainant's allegations. A complaint may also be "sustained for a violation
not based on original complaint" if the investigation reveals evidence of
misconduct that was not included in the complainant's original allegation but
arose out of the incident that is the subject of the complaint.
         B.   Exonerated: Preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct occurred but the officer's actions were consistent with law
or the Division of Police policy, procedure or training.
         C.   Unfounded: Preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct did not occur.
         D.   Insufficient evidence: Preponderance of the evidence fails to
establish whether or not the conduct occurred.
      (3)   Standard of disposition: The Board shall apply the "preponderance
of evidence" standard of proof, set forth in division (b) of this section, to
each and all of the allegations identified in the investigative file.

         B.   Decisions of the Board shall be made by majority vote.
         C.   In the event of a tie vote, the Board will return to the
executive session to deliberate further. If a majority vote cannot be achieved,
the Board will recess the case until its next meeting and deliberate anew.
   (g)   Recommendations: The Board shall make no recommendation regarding
potential discipline with regard to a "Sustained" finding.
   (h)   Final Summary.
      (1)   The Board Chair, in consultation with the City Attorney and
consistent with the recommendation of the Board, shall prepare a Final Summary
with respect to each case or matter under consideration, which shall be
presented for approval at the next scheduled Board meeting.
      (2)   The Final Summary shall include the Board's disposition and a brief
outline of the evidence that the Board concluded tended to support the
disposition and/or recommendation. If the Board's recommended disposition

Summary shall also include a written justification for the departure.
      (3)   Any member who does not concur with the recommendation of the Board
may prepared a separate dissenting summary for review and consideration at the
next scheduled meeting of the Board.
      (4)   If the Board issues a Final Summary with a "sustained" finding,
such finding shall have no binding effect on the Division of Police or Mayor.
If the Mayor and the Division of Police, upon receiving and reviewing the Final

or procedure or are unable to take further action due to the time limits
imposed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, the Final Summary
shall not be included within a subject employee's personnel file.

is of such a character as to manifest a substantial and improper influence upon
the person with respect to their duties except as otherwise provided by law.

than from the municipality he/she serves, for the performance of his/her public

purchase for supplies, materials, equipment, or provide labor for any work
under the supervision of their respective departments involving not more than
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
   (b)   All contracts in excess of the amount authorized in subsection (a)
above, shall be approved by City Council before being executed by any official
of the City, even if the appropriation for a contract has been previously

above, shall be subject to the competitive bidding requirements as set forth in
the City Charter, Codified Ordinances, or State law, unless an exception or
alternative is otherwise provided for by Council.
      (1)   When a proposed contract or expenditure exceeds the amount
authorized by subsection (a) above, then the Council shall, by motion,
authorize the appropriate City official to cause plans and specifications to be
prepared and advertise for bids once a week for two consecutive weeks in at
least one newspaper of general circulation within the City, and the Council
shall appropriate funds for that purpose unless they have been previously
appropriated and remain unencumbered.
      (2)   The Mayor and City Auditor, or their designated representatives,
shall receive and publicly announce sealed bids in the manner required by the
specifications. The Mayor shall recommend to the Council, at its next regular
Council meeting or a special Council meeting called for the purpose, the bid or
bids the Mayor believes to be the lowest and best bid. At such meeting or its
next regular meeting, the Council shall determine which bid or bids are the
lowest and best and shall by ordinance direct the Mayor to enter into written

ordinance directing the Mayor to enter into written contract shall appropriate
funds for the purpose of the contract unless funds have been previously

vote of at least two-thirds of its members, suspend any provision of this
chapter and direct the Mayor to enter into contract, without competitive
bidding, the purchase or expenditures for supplies, materials, equipment,
provide labor, or any other purpose the Council in its discretion deems
necessary and in the best interest of the City.
   (k)   No contract, agreement or other contractual obligation involving the
expenditure of money shall be entered into or authorized by the Mayor or
Council unless the City Auditor or a duly authorized representative of the
Auditor shall first certify that the money required for the contract,
agreement, obligation or expenditure is in the City's treasury or in the
process of collection and that the money has been appropriated by Council for
the purpose and remains unencumbered.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
   Chap.
181.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
      (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
      (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
         In Ward v. Village of Monroeville Ohio 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
         The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
         The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set
forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make
a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
         Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation
bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and
schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

Individuals.
   (a)   For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal

taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 190.04(c).
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to

or more of the following:

         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         C.   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (b)(1)A. and B. of
this section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semi-monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars
($11,999), or if in any month of the preceding calendar year exceeded one
thousand dollars ($1,000). Payment under division (b)(1)C. of this section
shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following: (i)
if the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld
during the first fifteen days of a month, the third banking day after the
fifteenth day of that month; (ii) if the taxes were deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and
before the first day of the immediately following month, the third banking day
after the last day of the month.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         A.   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of an
employer.
         B.   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this State, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
               If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (c)(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted
for "municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.

         G.   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this State at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
      (2)   A.   Subject to divisions (c)(3), (c)(5), (c)(6), and (c)(7) of
this section, an employer is not required to withhold the City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
this section.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (c)

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that
division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to
that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
190.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of this section.
(Ord. 59-17. Passed 6-12-17; Ord. 152-17. Passed 12-18-17.)
190.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by every
individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer that
is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to
the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
190.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for the City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives municipal taxable income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be

property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's Federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
            A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,

the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six (6)-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six (6)-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall giant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the City for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in Section
190.04(c)(1)G.) within the City.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.,
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
190.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (l)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the
member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred and eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred eighty-first
day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (l)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penally or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one (1) incumbent local exchange carrier that is

in this State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local
exchange carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(l) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 5727.01.
   (s)   (l)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one (1) member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5)-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5)-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five (5)-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (s)(l) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5)-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(l) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (l)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
190.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
190.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one (1) of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
190.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
190.05(r) through (y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
190.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under Section
190.05(r) through (y) by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one (1) or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

190.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the City under this chapter.
   (b)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under Ohio
R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Ohio R.C.
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
   (d)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City, who works in a county that imposes an income tax, to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in a municipal corporation.
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one (1) date on the cover,
the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
(12) months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
190.05(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the
tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the
tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
for an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first month of the
following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the
taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth
day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
190.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
190.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the City under Section
190.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

190.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.

190.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
190.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
190.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
190.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three (3)-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
190.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two (2) amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
190.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to
City income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or State tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
190.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,

the time limitation provided in Section
190.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
190.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
190.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that

a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 97-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
190.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or State law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

190.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund

provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or other

correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order which the Tax
Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the
appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

   (b)   (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six (6)
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's Social Security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
190.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
190.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Section
190.19(c) within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
190.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
190.99 for a violation of Section
190.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one (1) or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

subject to appeal.

the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten (10) days'
notice. The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and
not appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the

Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or Mayor that appointed the member shall appoint another
individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax Review in the member's
place. The appointment of such an individual shall be subject to the same
requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member
temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within
sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal
within fifteen (15) days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or
the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination
as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Ohio R.C.
149.43. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax Review created

121.22.

(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of the
City, for use of the General Fund of the City and for the further purpose of
providing revenues to promote and publicize the City, an excise tax is hereby
levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or transient accommodation
is or is to be furnished transient guests.
   The tax is six percent (6%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for lodging.
   The tax applies and is collectable at the time the lodging is furnished
regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply to
lodging furnished to the federal government or any of its agencies, when such
lodging is provided and paid directly by the federal government or any of its
agencies; the government of the State of Ohio or any of its agencies, when such
lodging is provided and paid directly by the State or its agencies; any
charitable organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals, when
such charitable organization pays the hotel or transient accommodation for such
lodging.
   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent
the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels or
transient accommodations in this City to transient guests is subject to tax
until the contrary is established.
   On and after January 1, 1993, all revenues generated by the provisions of
this chapter shall be disbursed as follows:
   (a)   Forty percent (40%) of the revenues shall be placed into the General
Fund to be reappropriated by Council for any lawful purpose.
   (b)   Sixty percent (60%) of the revenues shall be placed into an account
established by the Auditor and revenues shall be paid to the Reynoldsburg
Visitors and Community Activity Bureau on a monthly basis.
   (c)   Effective January 1, 2003 the amount generated by sixty percent (60%)
of the revenues, referred to in subsection (b), shall be seventy-five thousand
dollars ($75,000) per year, but shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars
($75,000) per year.

28-02; Ord. 103-09. Passed 12-28-09.)
192.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The City Auditor shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid illegally
or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where the vendor
has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such illegal or
erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was paid by the
transient guest directly to the City Auditor or his agent, he shall refund to
the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the City Auditor, on the
form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is ascertained that
the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous. However, in any event such
application for refund must be filed with the Auditor within four years from
the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of the tax. On filing of such
application the Auditor shall determine the amount of refund due and draw a
warrant for such amount to the person claiming such refund. The Auditor shall
make such payments from a Tax Refund Fund as established by ordinance.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.05 REQUIRED RECORDS: INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodgings furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity, of the transient guest, If the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, of the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Auditor of the City, and shall
be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall on or before the twentieth day of each month make and file
a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Auditor, showing
the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the vendor to
the City for the period covered by the return and such other information as the
Auditor deems necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The
Auditor may extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be
filed by mailing the same to the City Auditor, together with payment of the
amount of tax shown to be due thereon. The Auditor may authorize vendors whose
tax liability is not such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the
Auditor upon the basis of administrative costs to the City, to make and file
returns at less frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and
shall indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed. The Auditor
shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date received by him and shall
also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of payment received with the
return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under this chapter shall, for
each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the City Treasury the sum of one
dollar ($1.00). The Auditor, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to
be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the
vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.07 LIABILITY: ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Auditor may make
an assessment against such vendor based upon any information in the Auditor's
possession. If any vendor falls to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Auditor may make
an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession. An assessment against a
vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter has not
been collected or paid, shall not discharge the transient guest's liability to
reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable to such transaction.
   (b)   In each case the Auditor shall give to the vendor or transient guest
assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the
vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or certified
mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to an
assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been
paid by another.
   (c)   The Auditor may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to
file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of
tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the
Auditor indicates that the amount required to be collected is or should be
greater than the amount remItted by the vendor, the Auditor may upon the basis
of test checks of a vendor's business for a representative period which is
hereby authorized, determine the ratio which the tax required to be collected
under this chapter bears to the hotel's or transient accommodation's lodgings
which determination shall be the basis of an assessment as herein provided in
this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the manner prescribed
in this chapter.
   (d)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom such notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail a petition in writing, verified
under oath by such vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent, having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of such
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections such
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guests so assessed, to the Auditor of the
City. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Auditor shall assign a
time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner thereof
by registered or certified mail, but the Auditor may continue the hearings from
time to time if necessary.
   (e)   A penalty of fifteen percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Auditor may adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to assessments
made under this chapter.
   (f)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Auditor, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.08 FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Auditor has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes
collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not returned to
the City;
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.09 TAX PAID TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.10 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebatIng the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.11 REPORTS MUST BE FILED: FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Auditor to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Auditor may:
Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax
liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by the Auditor
from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such vendor, which
amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). The
security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the
tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the
Auditor, conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the returns from the
vendor. The security must be filed within ten days following the vendor's
receipt of the notice from the Auditor of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)
192.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the City under the provisions of this chapter, falls for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers charged with the responsibility of
filing returns and making payments, shall be personally liable for such
failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an officers's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or
remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by assessment in
the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 62-76. Passed 4-26-76.)

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided

in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle- related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., or (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division
forensic laboratory certified by the Department of Health that contains an
analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other
bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information specified in
this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the information and
statements that the report contains. The laboratory report shall contain all of
the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division is not available to a person who
withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)
(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-
state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person's
license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the
officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency
immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the
person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the
court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial appearance and any
action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of

of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of

operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

to Ohio R.C. 2929.24(E).
      (4)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.

reasonable conditions imposed by a court under division (c)(2) of this section.
   (b)   A first-time offender may file a petition for unlimited driving
privileges with a certified ignition interlock device during the period of
suspension imposed for an OVI offense in the same manner and in the same venue
as the person is permitted to apply for limited driving privileges.
   (c)   (1)   With regard to a first-time offender, in any circumstance in
which a court is authorized to grant limited driving privileges under Ohio R.C.
4510.021, 4510.13, or 4510.17 during the period of suspension, as applicable,
the court may instead grant unlimited driving privileges with a certified

circumstance, that the court is prohibited from granting limited driving
privileges.
      (2)   All of the following apply when a court grants unlimited driving
privileges with a certified ignition interlock device to a first-time offender:
         A.   1.   The court shall issue an order authorizing the first-time
offender to operate a motor vehicle only if the vehicle is equipped with a
certified ignition interlock device, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.43
(C). The order may include any reasonable conditions other than conditions that
restrict the driving privileges in terms of purpose, time, or place.

the expiration of the period of suspension imposed for the OVI offense and, if
the offender violates any term or condition of the order during the period of
suspension, the court shall require the first-time offender to serve the jail
term.
   (d)   (1)   A first-time offender shall present to the registrar or to a
deputy registrar an order issued under this section and a certificate affirming
the installation of a certified ignition interlock device that is in a form

the offender a restricted license, unless the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit is suspended under any other provision of law and
limited driving privileges have not been granted with regard to that
suspension. A restricted license issued under this division shall be identical

with a certified ignition interlock device under this section and the first-
time offender either commits an ignition interlock device violation as defined

that is not equipped with a certified ignition interlock device, the following
applies:
      (1)   On a first violation, the court may require the first-time offender
to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol monitoring that is remote.
      (2)   On a second violation, the court shall require the first-time
offender to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol monitoring that is
remote for a minimum of 40 days.
      (3)   On a third or subsequent violation, the court shall require the
first-time offender to wear a monitor that provides continuous alcohol
monitoring that is remote for a minimum of 60 days.
      (4)   With regard to any instance, the judge may increase the period of
suspension and the period during which the first-time offender must drive a
motor vehicle equipped with a certified ignition interlock device in the same
manner as provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.13(A)(8)(c). The limitation under Ohio
R.C. 4510.46(E) applies to an increase under division (e)(4) of this section.
      (5)   If the instance occurred within 60 days of the end of the
suspension of the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege and the court does not increase the period
of the suspension under division (e)(4) of this section, the court shall
proceed as follows:
         A.   Issue an order extending the period of suspension and the period
of time during which the first-time offender must drive a vehicle equipped with
a certified ignition interlock device so that the suspension terminates 60 days
from the date the offender committed that violation.
         B.   1.   For each violation subsequent to a violation for which an
extension was ordered under division (e)(5)A. of this section, issue an order
extending the period of suspension and the period of time during which the
first-time offender must drive a vehicle equipped with a certified ignition
interlock device so that the suspension terminates 60 days from the date the
offender committed that violation.
            2.   The registrar of motor vehicles is prohibited from reinstating
a first-time offender's license unless the applicable period of suspension has
been served and no ignition interlock device violations have been committed
within the 60 days prior to the application for reinstatement.
   (f)   (1)   With respect to an order issued under this section, the judge
shall impose an additional court cost of two dollars fifty cents ($2.50) upon
the first-time offender. The judge shall not waive this payment unless the
judge determines that the first-time offender is indigent and waives the
payment of all court costs imposed upon the indigent first-time offender. The
clerk of court shall transmit 100 percent of this mandatory court cost
collected during a month on or before the twenty-third day of the following
month to the State treasury to be credited to the State Highway Safety fund
created under Ohio R.C. 4501.06. The Department of Public Safety shall use the
amounts collected to cover costs associated with maintaining the habitual OVI/
OMWI offender registry created under Ohio R.C. 5502.10.
      (2)   A judge may impose an additional court cost of two dollars fifty
cents ($2.50) upon the first-time offender. The clerk of court shall retain
this discretionary two dollar fifty cent ($2.50) court cost, if imposed. The
clerk shall deposit it in the court's special projects fund that is established
under Ohio R.C. 2303.201(E)(1), Ohio R.C. 1901.26(B)(1), or Ohio R.C. 1907.24

to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the

criminal contempt under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the
underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

339.01 OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE PERMIT.
   (a)   (1)   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
         A.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
         B.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
         C.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject to
the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
      (2)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under division (a)(1) of this section, the municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
   (b)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
   (c)   (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (3)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
   (d)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under division (a)(1) of this section upon application and payment of the
applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (e)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the vehicle
or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection
by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit.
No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
   (f)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
   (g)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(G).
   (h)   (1)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to gross load limits.
      (2)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
      (3)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (i)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.
      (4)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge five dollars
($5.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police
officer in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of twenty-two dollars ($22.00) per hour per officer. The charge can be
prorated into fifteen minute increments.
      (5)   Signs shall be posted indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5

by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such
sign.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (3)
hereof has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43

to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus

   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(ORC 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct which includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty which he is capable of
performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a
sufficient time to have ended his possession.
      (4)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section 533.99 of this Code or Ohio R.C.
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless
another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to
impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall
impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under division
(b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 533.99 of this Code or Ohio R.C.
2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in sentencing an
offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing
court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, a term of
electronic monitoring without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without

         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(3) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)      In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (g)   Organization penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2901.23 shall be
fined by the court as follows:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four
thousand dollars ($4,000.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         G.   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2901.23, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to
occupy housing accommodations.

contract.

   (b)   "Juvenile" means an unmarried person under the age of eighteen.
   (c)   "Knowledge of character" means having general knowledge or reason to
know of, or a belief or grounds for belief which warrants further inspection or
inquiry of, the nature and character of the material. A person has such
knowledge when he or she knows or is aware that the material contains, depicts
or describes nudity, sexual contact, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or
sadomasochistic sexual abuse, whichever is applicable, whether or not such
person has precise knowledge of the specific contents. A person need not have
knowledge of the legal status of the material.
   (d)   “Material.” Any book, magazine, newspaper, pamphlet, poster, print,
picture, figure, image, description, motion picture film, video cassette, laser
disc, phonograph record, cassette tape, compact disc, or other tangible thing

      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or

is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.

that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried

(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,

materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered

such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.

value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

operations by the operator such operator is under obligation to remove all of
his equipment and installations over and under City streets, at the request of

791.06 SCOPE OF OPERATIONS.
   In addition to conventional services currently being offered by operating
community antenna television systems, including the signals of TV and FM
stations and also programming originated by the operators, this chapter,
anticipating the future of a "Wired City", specifically covers the following:
   (a)   Pay television, programming for which a special or extra fee is
charged, if not prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission, and if
such service is offered by the operator.
   (b)   The sale of advertising in connection with locally originated
programming, if such sales are authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission, and if such sales are made by the operator.
   (c)   Any other service or services involving the use of electronic signals
if authorized by the Federal Communications Commission and if such additional
services are offered by the operator.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.07 RATES FOR SERVICE TO SUBSCRIBERS.
   (a)   The rates for basic service and such ancillary services as may from
time to time be provided by the operator shall be determined by marketplace
considerations. The operator shall file a schedule of all of its rates with the
City prior to the effective date of such rates, of the commencement of a new
service, or of a change in established rates and prior to the notification to
subscribers of such rates or rate change.
   (b)   Optional services of a noncontinuous nature, such as individual
movies, sports events, education programs, etc., may have variable rates and
are exempt from filing requirements.
   (c)   At such time as the operator attains a penetration level of eighty
percent (80%), the City may regulate the rates charged by such operator. The
term "penetration level" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of basic
service subscribers to the total number of households passed by the operator's
cable system.
   (d)   The operator shall not charge subscribers' rates in excess of the
filed rates for any service requiring filing of rates, and the operator agrees
that rates for services in the City will not exceed those rates charged in the
City of Columbus.
(Ord. 100-82. Passed 11-22-82.)
791.08 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The operator, in compliance with current rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, shall afford full time, nonduplicated
carriage to WBNS-TV, WLWC-TV, WOSU-TV and WTVN-TV and to any other television
station licensed to the City of Columbus by the FCC and which goes on the air.
   (b)   It is the intent of this section to require the carriage outlined in
subsection (a) hereof, which shall be without the degrading of signals and
without deletion of advertising or any material contained in such telecasts,
even though the Federal Communications Commission at some future date might
amend or even eliminate rules and regulations applicable to carriage and
protection of local stations. Therefore, this particular provision shall remain
in force so long as there are no laws, rules or regulations prohibiting such
carriage, and so long as the operator is not forbidden to do so by the stations
involved.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.09 SPECIAL PROVISIONS.
   Taking into account certain additional services which, to be successful,
necessarily would have to cross corporate lines of many Greater Columbus
municipalities, and considering these services to be in the public interest,
and not wanting to curtail their development, the following services are
specifically exempted from licensing requirements and excluded from fee
payments to the City, so long as such services are offered by an operator
holding a permit under City ordinance.
   (a)   Services created primarily for area hotels and motels, and utilized as
a promotional information vehicle for Greater Columbus, reaching only guests in
participating hotels and motels.
   (b)   Services created for special and/or occasional closed circuit
presentations, or for the viewing and/or listening of the general public.
      This particular exclusion/exemption is not applicable to any regular,
continuing service or services which the operator may offer pursuant to Section
791.07(c).
   (c)   Services created for nonprofit organizations.
   (d)   The exemptions and exclusions detailed herein shall apply to both
originations by the operator and to signals merely retransmitted and/or
distributed by the operator.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.10 PERMITS TO OPERATE COMMUNITY ANTENNA SYSTEMS IN THE CITY.
   (a)   No operator shall offer service to subscribers by means of a community
antenna system within the City unless he holds a permit granted by ordinance of
Council, and authorizing such a system within the City, and in, under and over
streets, highways and other public grounds of the City.
   (b)   All permits granted by ordinance pursuant to this section shall be
nonexclusive and nonassignable and Council reserves the right to issue as many
such permits as it deems advisable in the public interest.
   (c)   Any permit granted under the terms of this chapter shall be declared
null and void one year from the date it is granted, and such permit shall be
revoked unless the operator, or operators, who received such permit
satisfactorily demonstrate to the Service Director compliance with the
timetable set forth in subsection (d) hereof.
   (d)   The operator, not later than six months from the effective date of the
ordinance granting him a permit, shall furnish to Council, for approval,
complete plans and specifications for the construction and operation of his
system, including transmission and distribution, which insofar as is
technically and economically practical shall call for service to all the
incorporated area of the City, as of that date. Within thirty days after
receiving approval from Council, the operator shall make and present his most
diligent efforts to obtain whatever agreements, if any, are required from
utility companies, and approvals from various City departments and regulatory
agencies required herein. After obtaining all these necessary agreements and
approvals the operator shall begin construction of the system within ninety
days thereafter and shall continue at such a rate as to make the service
contemplated by this chapter available to at least one-half of all residences
in the City within one year after commencement of construction, and available
to all residences, business establishments and other potential users in the
City within two years after commencement of construction.
   (e)   The permit shall take effect and will be in force from and after the
earliest period allowed by law, and upon the filing by the operator with the
Director of his acceptance, in writing, of each and all of the terms and
provisions of this chapter. However, if the operator shall fall to file such
written acceptance within thirty days after the passage of the ordinance by
Council, then the ordinance granting his permit shall be null and void.
   (f)   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of
this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any Court of
competent jurisdiction, or in conflict with rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, then such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision of this chapter, and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.
   (g)   Any permit granted pursuant to this chapter may be revoked by a simple
majority vote of Council upon the recommendation of the Director for violation
of provisions of this chapter, by giving the operator ninety days notice in
writing of intention to revoke such permit unless such violation is corrected
during the period of notice.
      (1)   The term of each permit shall be for a period of not more than
fifteen years, the effective date to be pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, with
the right of renewal at the option of Council for succeeding periods, each of
no more than ten years.
      (2)   The operator shall be advised in writing, no less than ninety days
prior to the end of the period covered by his permit, whether his permit is to
be renewed for another like period. And while it is not the intention of this
chapter to provide for automatic renewals, no existing operation will be
terminated without due and just cause.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.11 CONDITION OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Not less than ninety days after the initial offering of service to
subscribers, the operator shall make available his basic monthly service to all
applicants whose residences or commercial establishments are contiguous to a
main or lateral cable, or within range of radio waves if radio waves are
utilized for the transmission and distribution of signals.
   (b)   In anticipation of ultimately making all services available to every
dwelling unit and commercial establishment within the corporate limits,
regardless of location, in accordance with Section
791.10(d) the operator is to achieve this goal as rapidly as possible, and is
to keep the Service Director advised of all extensions of service beyond that
contemplated in his original plans and specifications as approved.
   (c)   All expanded service, once offered by the operator, shall be made
available to all applicants whose residences or commercial establishments are
contiguous to a main or lateral cable, or within range of radio waves if radio
waves are utilized for transmission and distribution.
   (d)   Service to multiple-unit buildings, including apartment houses and
office buildings, will be subject to the permission of the owner or operator of
each building.
   (e)   The operator shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities,
repairs, maintenance, rules, regulations, or in any other respect, make or
grant preference or advantage to any person or business, nor subject any person
or business to any prejudice or disfavor.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.12 PERMIT FEES; PAYMENT.
   (a)   The operator, for the privilege of holding a permit to operate a
community antenna system in the City, which entitles him to offer his service
or services, and to install his distribution and transmission facilities in,
under and over the streets, highways and other public grounds of the City,
subject to the overall provisions of this chapter which have been conceived for
the protection of the City and its citizens, shall make payments to the City as
follows:
      (1)   The Company shall pay to the City a fee of three percent (3%) of
gross basic service and installation subscriber revenues received for cable
television operations in the City. No other fee, charge or consideration shall
be imposed. Sales tax or other taxes levied directly on a per subscription
basis and collected by the Company shall be deducted from the gross basic
service and installation subscriber revenues before computation of sums due the
City is made.
      (2)   The operator shall pay a minimum fee of fifteen hundred dollars
($1,500) annually for the period of his permit.
         A.   The first payment of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) shall
accompany the operator's acceptance of his permit, as required by Section
791.10(e).
         B.   The operator shall have the option of operating under a calendar
year or fiscal year plan; and the minimum fee may be prorated during his first
year to correspond to his books, with a like, balancing adjustment during the
final year of the period covered by his initial permit. Once the operating year
has been established, payment of the minimum fee will be made within thirty
days following the start of each new year.
         C.   The minimum fee shall be credited to the required three percent
(3%) of gross basic service and installation subscriber revenues payable
annually to the City.
   (b)   All payments to the City under this chapter shall be made quarterly
within the year as determined by the operator pursuant to subsection (a)(2)
hereof.
      (1)   The first three quarterly payments may be on the basis of unaudited
gross basic service and installation subscriber revenues, and shall be due and
payable within thirty days of the end of each quarter.
      (2)   The year-end payment shall be due and payable within ninety days
after the close of the operator's operating year.
         A.   The operator, at the time of this payment, shall submit complete
accounting information to substantiate the amount of payments made; certified
verification will be provided to the Auditor, attested to be an independent
audit of the operator' s books made and certified to by a certified public
accountant.
   (c)   All payments to the City shall be by check made payable to the City
and either hand- delivered or sent by registered mail to the Auditor.
   (d)   Council and the Service Director and their delegates shall have the
right to reasonable inspection of the books, records, maps, plans and other
like material of the operator at the office of the operator during normal
business hours.
   (e)   The operator shall submit a complete annual operating report as
specified by the Director within ninety days after closing of the operator's

operator's books and certified to by a certified public accountant.
(Ord. 138-75. Passed 11-10-75; Ord. 142-90. Passed 12-10-90.)
791.13 BASIS OF SERVICE.
   The service to be offered by the operator shall be on a solely voluntary
basis on the part of the subscriber, who, if his residence or commercial
establishment is contiguous to main or lateral cables or within range of radio
waves if radio waves are utilized for transmission and distribution, may
subscribe to the aforementioned service at will. Under no circumstances will
the operator require a subscriber to pay for service longer than the service is
desired.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.14 DELAYS.
   Provisions of this section notwithstanding, delays in the performance of the
operator's obligations under this chapter which are caused by, equipment
shortages, a state of war or national emergency, acts of God, or any
circumstances beyond the control of the operator, as determined by Council
shall not be construed to be in violation of the requirements set forth herein,
and reasonable extension of time shall be granted therefor.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.15 SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This is an enabling ordinance authorizing the operation of CATV system
(s) in the City of Reynoldsburg, but it does not take the place of any
franchise, license or permit which may be additionally required by law of the
operator either currently or at some later date.
   (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the operator to obtain any and all
such franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the operation and conduct of
his business activities.
   (c)   Failure of the operator to obtain and conform to the provisions of any
and all such franchises, licenses or permits, and to make prescribed payments
if required as a condition of their issuance, shall be considered in violation
of this chapter, and subject to the penalties set forth in Sections
791.10 (g) and
791.99.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.16 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   (a)   Considering the concept of the "wired city" to be valid and believing
that it will not only become a reality in the foreseeable future but will
require a combination of cable and off-the-air transmission for the ultimate in
services, the philosophy of Council is as follows:
      (1)   In setting forth the guidelines for the operation of CATV, this,
for all practical purposes, being the beginning of a "wired city", insofar as
Council may do so without being in conflict with rules and regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, it is the intent to make possible the
offering of a variety of services, while at the same time affording the City
and its citizens maximum protection.
      (2)   In these guidelines is recognition of the right of the operator, or
operators, to have a profitable enterprise and to return invested capital to
stockholders with a gain.
      (3)   In summation, the philosophy might be stated as one based on mutual
good faith, as involving the City, its citizens and the operator.
   (b)   Underscoring certain pertinent facts having to do with communication
ventures, primarily radio and television type services, which are considered
relevant to the enabling legislation for CATV and which are detailed below in
subparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4), it is the stated intention of Council not
to impose unreasonable ceilings on rates to subscribers, which in the final
analysis, under the free enterprise system, will be dictated by the subscriber,
and not by the operator of some regulatory body, nor to specify unrealistic
fees to be paid by the operator to the City.
      (1)   The speculative nature of a CATV system required to compete in and
to meet the demands of a "wired city" without the benefits, or protection, of
an exclusive operator's permit, is noted, together with a need for substantial
risk capital on a long term basis.
      (2)   Restricted broadcast competition for radio and television stations,
a monopolistic condition created by FCC allocation tables or spectrum
limitations, is noted.
      (3)   That broadcast stations pay no fees to anyone for using the
public's air space for the transmission of their signals is noted.
      (4)   And that broadcast stations are subject to no rules or regulations
of the Federal government, where the right of regulation is solely vested,
establishing maximum charges for advertising nor imposing a predetermined rate
of return on investment, are also noted.
   (c)   Conversely, but as another facet of the mutual good faith philosophy
introduced in part in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, it is the stated
intention of this chapter to require maximum value service for subscribers in
the City; therefore, Council retains the option, to be exercised upon
recommendation of the Service Director, for a thorough annual review to
ascertain:
      (1)   The fairness of the operator's rates; and
      (2)   Whether the fees paid to the City in previous years by the operator
were adequate and/or justifiable, each as measured against the service or
services being rendered subscribers; and
      (3)   whether the operations authorized hereunder continue to be in the
public interest.
   (d)   In order for the operator to meet the prerequisites of "maximum value
service" to subscribers, his system necessarily must be viable, and a
worthwhile investment for ownership, otherwise, operating funds for optimum
service and sufficient additional capital for expansion and extension of
service in the future, as both anticipated and desired by Council, will not be
available
   It is to be emphasized that Council, with such an understanding as expressed
in subsection (d) hereof, will never act capriciously or arbitrarily with its
right of review as set forth in subsection (c) hereof, and no review will be
undertaken and no action detrimental to the operator proposed as a result of
such a review, which has been motivated by the operator's profit and loss
record alone, the overwhelming issue in any and all reviews being the propriety
of charges for service versus the service itself, this being of far greater
import to Council than payments to the City.
   (e)   Additionally, as initially set forth in Section
791.07(b), no action with respect to rates and/or fees paid to the City will be
taken without the operator being given opportunity to be heard by Council.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)
791.99 PENALTY.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
501.99 for penalties applicable to any misdemeanor classifications.)
   In addition to the provisions of Section
791.10(g) having to do with revocation of permits, whoever violates any
provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each day such
violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 77-75. Passed 6-9-75.)

operating, and maintaining a system in the city, an operator may erect,
install, construct, repair, replace, relocate, reconstruct and retain in, on,
over, under, upon, across and along the streets within the city such lines,
cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary and
appurtenant to the operation of the system, provided that all applicable
permits, including the permit, are applied for and granted, all fees paid and
all other city codes and ordinances are otherwise complied with.
   (b)   Nature of Chapter. This chapter shall authorize an operator to provide
both cable services on the system and noncable services on the system. The
authority granted herein authorizes the operator to provide noncable services
on the system; provided, however, that the operator may petition the Mayor for
any necessary amendment of its permit to provide such noncable services on the
system without the need to secure further authorization from the city. Subject
to any applicable provisions of state or federal law, the Mayor shall grant
such authority, conditioned upon acceptance by such operator of whatever terms
and conditions the Mayor reasonably determines are appropriate in the
circumstances, it being understood and agreed that, at a minimum, such terms
and conditions may include payment to the city of compensation in respect of
such noncable services at rates different, but no greater, than those set forth
herein; provided that other competing providers of such noncable services are
also required to make similar payments and comply with similar terms and
conditions, whether the city imposes such payments, terms and conditions,
whether the city imposes such payments, terms and conditions pursuant to state
or federal law, this chapter or other provisions of the Reynoldsburg City
Codes.
   (c)   Mayor's Authority. The Mayor is hereby granted the authority to enter
into permits with operators, or to modify the same from time to time, pursuant
to and consistent with the provisions of this chapter or the permit which binds
the operator to the terms of this chapter and the permit. Such permits may also
contain such other provisions as may be negotiated between the Mayor and any
operator which the Mayor deems appropriate under the circumstances. All such
permits shall be submitted to City Council for, its approval, shall contain
reasonably similar terms and conditions such that there is no undue
discrimination among various operators, given the current conditions and the
relative vintage of the permits, and shall be effective as set forth in the
ordinance or resolution approving the same.
(Ord. 91-99, passed 7-26-99.)
793.04 DESIGN PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Interconnection. Each operator shall design its system to allow the
same to be interconnected with other networks serving the city or serving areas
adjacent to the city, so long as reasonably technically and economically
feasible.
   (b)   Use of Existing Facilities. The operator shall not erect any pole on
or along any street in an existing aerial utility system except in accordance
with Section
793.03(A). The operator shall exercise its best efforts to negotiate the lease

construction. Each operator shall cooperate with each other operator, the city
and any others lawfully utilizing the city rights of way, so as to best utilize
the use of the right of way for the benefit of the public and without
unnecessary duplication of facilities.
   (c)   Reservation of Street Rights.
      (1)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the city from
constructing, maintaining, repairing or relocating sewers; grading, paving,
maintaining, repairing, relocating and/or altering any street; constructing,
laying down, repairing, maintaining or relocating any water mains; or
constructing, maintaining, relocating, or repairing any sidewalk or other
public work.
      (2)   If any property of the operator shall interfere with the
construction or relocation, maintenance or repair of any street or public
improvement, whether it be construction, repair, maintenance, removal or
relocation of a sewer, public sidewalk, water main, street, or any other public
work or improvement, 30 days notice shall be given to the operator by the city
and all such poles, wires, conduits or other appliances and facilities shall be
removed or replaced by the operator in such manner as shall be directed by the
city so that the same shall not interfere, with the said public work of the
city, as reasonably determined by the city, and such removal or replacement
shall be at the expense of the operator.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this chapter shall relieve any Person from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
injuring the operator's facilities while performing any work connected with
grading, regarding, or changing the line of any street or public place or with
the construction or reconstruction of any sewer or water system.
      (4)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed so as to grant any
right or interest in any street or public property or other city rights-of-way
other than that explicitly set forth herein.
   (d)   Street Vacation or Modification. In the event any street or portion
thereof used by the operator shall be vacated or modified by the city or the
use thereof discontinued by the operator during the term of any permit granted
pursuant to this chapter, the operator shall, at the operator's expense,
forthwith relocate or remove or with the consent of the Mayor (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) abandon in place its facilities therefrom
unless specifically permitted by the city to continue the same, and upon the
relocation or removal thereof restore, repair or reconstruct the street area
where such removal has occurred, and place the street area where such removal
has occurred to a condition similar to that existing before such removal took
place. In the event of failure, neglect or refusal of the operator, after 30
days written notice by the city to remove the facilities or to repair, restore,
reconstruct, improve or maintain such street area, the city may do such work or
cause it to be done, and the cost thereof as found and declared by the city
shall be paid by the operator as directed by the city and collection may be
made by any available remedy.

move or remove any of the operator's wires, cables, poles, or other facilities
placed pursuant to this chapter, in order to lawfully move a large object,
vehicle, building or other structure over the streets of the city, upon two
weeks written notice by the city to the operator, the operator shall, at the
expense of the person requesting the temporary removal of such facilities,
comply with city's request. Any service disruption provisions of this chapter
shall not apply in the event that the removal of the operator's wires, cables,
poles or other facilities results in temporary service disruptions.

The city may determine that the award of any permit shall be made on the basis
of such considerations with or without competitive bidding, or otherwise in its

copy, upon not less than 72 hours written notice, at any time during normal
business hours at the operator's offices or elsewhere, any and all books,

time for those violations which cannot be reasonably cured within 30 days.
   (e)   Revocation Procedures In the event the Mayor determines that any
operator may be subject to revocation for violation of the provisions of
Section
793.06(d), the city may make a written demand on the operator that the operator
remedy such violation and that continued violation may be cause for revocation
of said operator's permit. If the violation is not remedied to the satisfaction
of the Mayor within 30 days following such demand, the Mayor shall call a
hearing before the Compliance Committee to determine whether there is evidence
upon which the operator's permit may be revoked by the city. The Mayor shall
provide the operator written notice concerning the revocation hearing. The
reasons alleged to constitute cause for revocation shall be recited in the
notice, with said notice affirmatively reciting the causes that need to be
shown by the city to support a revocation.

Compliance Committee and establish the hearing procedures.
      (2)   The Compliance Committee shall determine whether or not the
violation set forth in the notice has occurred, whether or not the violation by
the operator is due to Force Majeure, and whether or not the violation provides
cause upon which the operator's permit may be revoked. If the Compliance
Committee determines there is a violation by the operator, the Compliance
Committee shall direct the operator to correct or remedy the same within such
reasonable time, in such manner and upon such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Compliance Committee may direct.
      (3)   If the Compliance Committee determines that the operator's
performance of any of the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of
this chapter or the permit were prevented or impaired due to Force Majeure,
such inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused to the extent caused by
such Force Majeure and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result
thereof, provided the operator has notified city in writing within 30 days of
its discovery of the occurrence of such an event of Force Majeure.
      (4)   If the Compliance Committee determines there was a violation which
provides cause upon which the operator's permit may be revoked, then the
Compliance Committee may recommend to City Council, in writing, the permit be
revoked and canceled and of no further force and effect unless there is
compliance within such reasonable period as the Compliance Committee may fix
provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or
misrepresentation.
      (5)   The issue of revocation shall be placed upon the City Council
agenda no sooner than at the expiration of the time set for compliance. The
operator shall be provided written notice as to when the issue of revocation
will be considered by the City Council. The City Council shall review the
recommendation of the Compliance Committee and the record before the Compliance
Committee, along with any evidence as to the operator's remedial actions to
achieve compliance which may be provided by the Mayor or the operator. After
hearing, the City Council may terminate the operator's permit forthwith upon
finding that there is cause upon which to revoke the operator's permit and that
the operator has failed to achieve compliance, except failure to achieve
compliance need not be shown where the violation involves fraud or
misrepresentation, the City Council may further extend the period for
compliance, at its discretion, reserving the City Council's right to terminate
the operator's permit after further hearing before City Council, if compliance
is not achieved by the operator.
      (6)   Termination of an operator's permit by City Council shall be deemed
a final administrative action by the city after which the parties may pursue
their remedies pursuant to this chapter or any other remedy, legal or
equitable.

907.02 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of the
use or occupation of all Rights-of-Way in the City, the issuance of Right-of-
Way Permits to Persons for such use or occupancy and to set forth the policies
of the City related thereto.
   (b)   A Right-of-Way Permit issued pursuant to this chapter does not take
the place of any Franchise, service permit, license, or permit which may be
additionally required by law, including any required by
Chapter 901, Reynoldsburg City Code. Each Permittee shall obtain any and all
such additional state, federal or city franchises, licenses or permits
necessary to the operation and conduct of its business or the occupation or use
of any Right-of-Way; provided, however, that no Permittee holding a valid
Right-of-Way Permit shall be required to obtain a Franchise for any type of
services rendered by said Permittee for which the City did not require
Franchises at the time said Permittee's Permit was last issued or renewed.
Should there be a direct conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a
valid Franchise, the provisions of the Franchise shall prevail; provided,
however, that additional obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The Director is hereby directed and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The City's policy regarding Rights-of-Way is:
      (1)   To promote the utilization of Rights-of-Way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the City;
      (2)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services, to the City's residents and taxpayers at
reasonable costs;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the Permittees and the City in the
occupation of Rights-of-Way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during Right-of-Way work, and eliminate wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (4)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
Rights-of-Way and the costs related thereto, including the regulation thereof;
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
Rights-of-Way; and when all requests for Right-of-Way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of Rights-of-Way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:
         A.   The City for Governmental Purposes;
         B.   Another governmental entity for Governmental Purposes with the
City's concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;
         C.   General Right-of-Way Permittees and proprietary uses by the City;
and
         D.   Limited Right-of-Way Permittees; provided, however, that the
Director may reasonably require cooperation and accommodation among Permittees
in the public interest; and
      (7)   To assure that Applicants have the financial, technical and
managerial resources to comply with this chapter and the provisions of any
Right-of-Way Permit issued hereunder; provided that, for purposes of this
chapter, an Applicant possessing valid certification or other valid authority
to operate pursuant to authority granted to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio, including certification pursuant to R.C. 4933.81 et seq., for the
services to be provided by the facilities subject to this chapter shall be
presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources, unless otherwise shown by clear and convincing evidence.
   (e)   All Right-of-Way Permits granted hereunder shall be non-exclusive and
no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting of a Permit
under this chapter.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed to
apply the provisions of this chapter, to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the City or any City operations that occupy or use the Rights-of-
Way. Further, the costs imposed by the City's occupancy or use of the Rights-
of-Way shall not be included in the costs to the City to manage and maintain
the Rights-of-Way. It is specifically contemplated, however, that all City
Departments or Divisions that utilize the Rights-of-Way shall carry out their
operations in a manner consistent with the policy set forth in this chapter,
including participation and cooperation in all joint planning hereunder and
identification of structures and facilities located in the Rights-of-Way.
(Ord. 32-05. Passed 5-9-05.)
907.03 PROHIBITION; TYPES OF PERMITS; RIGHT-OF-WAY BOARD.
   (a)   Unless otherwise permitted pursuant to the Reynoldsburg City Codes, no
Person shall use, occupy, construct, own or operate structures or facilities
in, under or over any Rights-of-Way or any Public Property within the City

      (7)   Other uses not incompatible with the City policies as specified in
this
Chapter 907 as approved by the Director; and
      (8)   Residential Purposes, so long as, in the opinion of the Director,
such use:

including any under
Chapter 901, Reynoldsburg City Code;
         B.   Is not inconsistent with policy of the City;
         C.   Does not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare;
and
         D.   Does not materially interfere with the other lawful use of the
Right-of-Way.
   The Director shall develop Regulations controlling and further defining
Residential Purposes and to otherwise implement the determinations to be made
under this Section. Such Regulations shall, among other matters, specify that
the owner of facilities that holds title to such facilities solely as a result
of a Leaseback shall not be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
"Leaseback" means the sale or transfer of property by a Permittee to another
Person contemporaneously followed by the leasing of the property to the
Permittee on a long term basis, that are not operated or controlled by said
lessee, and are operated or controlled by the Permittee, are not considered to
be using, occupying, owning or operating such facilities, for purposes of this

Person for a specific, limited use of the Rights-of-Way or a specific portion

Right-of-Way. Limited Right-of-Way Permits may be granted for any amount of
Right-of-Way to agencies of the government of the United States, the State of
Ohio, or its political subdivisions for Governmental Purposes.
   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to preclude the City from
requiring any Person offering any natural gas, electric, cable television,
communications or other utility services for which the City may lawfully
require a Franchise, to acquire a Franchise upon the expiration of any Right-
of-Way Permit issued hereunder.
   (c)   Any such Right-of-Way Permit may also allow the use of specified
Public Property for the uses set forth in the Right-of-Way Permit and in this
chapter.
   (d)   Each Right-of-Way Permit shall specify the use or uses for which it is
granted and contain such other non-discriminatory terms and conditions as are
appropriate and as are set forth in the Regulations.
   (e)   Unless otherwise set forth herein, Right-of-Way Permits or the rights
of a Permittee thereunder are not transferable without the prior express
written approval of the Director, upon written request. Such request shall
contain evidence that the proposed transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of
the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, possesses a valid certification from
the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to
R.C. 4933.81, et seq., and/or is recognized on the rolls of the Public

Director, the Chair of Council's Service Committee and the City Engineer. The
Right-of-Way Board shall act by majority vote and each of its members may
designate an alternate, in writing, to perform such member's duties and
obligations in such member's absence. The Director shall act as chair of the
Right-of-Way Board.
(Ord. 32-05. Passed 5-9-05; Ord. 84-05. Passed 10-24-05.)
907.04 APPLICATION PROCEDURE, APPEAL.
   (a)   Applications for a General Right-of-Way Permit by a holder of a
Franchise shall be filed with the Director in such form and in such manner as
the Regulations require. There shall be no application fee. Any Person holding
a valid Franchise shall be granted a General Right-of-Way Permit. Such General
Right-of-Way Permit shall be valid so long as the underlying Franchise is valid
and the applicable provisions of that Franchise, the Right-of-Way Permit and of
this chapter are complied with; provided, however, that such Right-of-Way
Permit shall only relate to and entitle the Permittee to utilize the Rights-of-
Way, in accordance with this chapter, for purposes directly related to the
provision of the specific services for which it has a Franchise. Any other
Right-of-Way use by such Permittee shall require a separate or amended Right-
of-Way Permit issued pursuant to Section
907.04(b).
   (b)   All other applications for General Right-of-Way Permits, or amendments
or renewals thereof, shall be filed with the Director in such form and in such
manner as the Regulations require, along with an application fee of Five
Hundred Dollars ($500.00). The Director shall determine if the application is
in order and shall, within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of a complete
application, issue a written report regarding such application. The report
shall recommend that the Right-of-Way Board deny or grant the Right-of-Way
Permit, subject to any appropriate terms and conditions, in accordance with the
criteria set forth in this chapter. The Director's report shall be served upon
the Applicant by mail along with a notice of when the Right-of-Way Board will
consider the same. The Right-of-Way Board shall then consider such
recommendation and make a final determination in writing, within fifteen (15)
days of the Director's report, as to whether or not such Right-of-Way Permit
should be granted and if so, upon what terms and conditions. The term of each
such General Right-of-Way Permit shall be for ten (10) years from issuance, or
such lesser term as the Applicant requests.
   (c)   An application for a Limited Right-of-Way Permit, or renewal thereof,
shall be filed in such form and in such manner as the Regulations require,
along with an application fee of either:
      (1)   Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for a Limited Right-of-Way Permit for
Residential Purposes; or
      (2)   Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for all others.
   If the Director determines that the application is in order and that the
criteria set forth in Section
907.05 have been met, and that the application should be granted, the Director
shall, within forty-five (45) days of a receipt of a completed application,
conditionally grant or renew such a Right-of-Way Permit subject to any
appropriate terms and conditions or deny the same. The Director's conditional
grant, renewal or denial shall be served upon the Applicant by mail. Such
conditional denial, grant or renewal shall become final unless modified or
rejected by the Right-of-Way Board within fifteen (15) days of issuance by the
Director. The term of such Limited Right-of-Way Permits shall be three (3)
years from issuance, or such lesser term as the Applicant requests. A Limited
Right-of-Way Permit for Residential Purposes may be granted for an indefinite
term from issuance, but may be cancelled by the Director with sixty (60) days
written notice.
   (d)   Any Applicant may appeal the failure of the Director to conditionally
grant a Right-of-Way Permit, or to recommend it to be granted upon terms and
conditions acceptable to the Applicant, to the Right-of-Way Board. In order to
perfect such appeal, the Applicant shall file, within ten (10) days of the
Director's determination or recommendation, or within forty-five (45) days of
the filing of the application if the Director has taken no action, an appeal to
the Right-of-Way Board. The Right-of-Way Board shall then review the matter and
after affording the Applicant an opportunity to be heard either in person or in
writing render a final determination within fifteen days of the filing of the
appeal, unless such period is waived by the Applicant. Except to the extent
otherwise appealable by law, the Right-of-Way Board's decision shall be final
with regard to all decisions regarding Limited Right-of-Way Permits. Decisions
of the Right-of-Board regarding General Right-of-Way Permits may be appealed to
City Council. Such appeal shall be filed with the clerk of Council in such form
as the Regulation requires, within fifteen days of the decision appealed from.
Decisions of Council on such appeals shall be final.
   (e)   Any Right-of-Way Permittee shall, within thirty (30) days of the
granting or renewal of any Right-of-Way Permit hereunder, if and as applicable,
pay a pro-rata portion of the fees required by Section
907.07(b) or (c); provided, however, that should the Permittee appeal, and
during the pendency thereof the Permittee does not use or occupy any Right-of-
Way, the Permittee shall not be required to pay such pro-rata portion of said
fees until such appeal has been finally determined.

manhole on sewers or cleanouts on connections in order to properly maintain the
velocity of not less than two feet per second in the pipe and the minimum grade
on eight-inch diameter sewers shall not be less than four-tenths percent (.4%).
The minimum grade in any house connection shall be not less than one-quarter
inch per foot of run. Grade and alignment shall be accurately maintained during
installation.
(Ord. 101-89. Passed 9-11-89.)
   (c)   Trench. The trench for all sewers and connections shall be carefully
excavated and shall be properly sheeted, if necessary, to prevent caving. The
width of trench shall not exceed the outside diameter of the barrel of the pipe
plus fifteen inches from the bottom of the trench to a point twelve inches over
the barrel of the pipe.
   (d)   Foundation. All pipe installed either as sewer or house connection
shall be installed with granular backing from a point three inches under the
barrel to the springline of the pipe. Such granular material shall be three-
quarters inch crushed aggregate.
(Ord. 101-89. Passed 9-11-89.)
   (e)   Pipe Strength. All sewer pipe installed either as sewer or house
connection with less than twelve feet of earth cover may be standard strength
pipe. All pipe with more than twelve feet of cover, either at the time of
installation or ultimately, shall be extra strength. Cover in excess of twenty-
five feet, either at the time of installation or ultimately will require
special treatment to be designated for each case by the Engineer.
   (f)   Backfill. Trenches may be backfilled with material excavated from the
trench provided that no rocks or boulders larger than six inches in the largest
dimension may be placed in the zone three feet above the pipe and then only if
the earth back fill above the pipe is thoroughly tamped in six-inch layers. No
other special back fill procedures shall be required except where sewers or
house connections are located in street or alley rights of way, or as specified
by the owner.
   (g)   Streets and Alleys. Wherever sewers or house connections are located
in streets or alleys, existing or proposed, the trenches shall be backfilled
with an approved compacted granular material from the spring line of the pipe
to the proposed or existing subgrade of the pavement.
   (h)   Connections to Sewer. The sewer service builder making a house
connection to a sewer shall exercise extreme care to remove the stopper in the
wye to ensure that no earth, gravel, debris, etc., enters the sewer. If a wye
branch is not available, the contractor shall install an acceptable sewer
saddle wye. This work shall be performed under the direct supervision of the
Wastewater Superintendent or his designated representative.
(Ord. 101-89. Passed 9-11-89.)
   (i)   Old House Connections. If for any reason a dwelling not previously
connected to the system is required to make a connection and the owner wishes
to use an existing drain pipe, he shall demonstrate that the pipe is
substantially equal to that required under these regulations and if so
demonstrated, the existing drain may be used with the approval of the
Superintendent. Substitutions shall be approved by the Superintendent.
957.17 ADDRESS FOR BILLING.
   Bills shall be rendered to the owner of the property to which service is

959.08   Appeal.
959.01 DEFINITIONS.
   "Credit" means a reduction in a customer's stormwater service fee given for
certain qualifying activities which reduce either the impact of increased
stormwater runoff or reduces the City's costs of providing stormwater
management. The qualifying activities are prescribed herein.
   "Detention facility" means a facility, by means of a single control point,
which provides temporary storage of stormwater runoff in ponds, parking lots,
depressed areas, rooftops, buried underground vaults or tanks, etc., for future
release, and is used to delay and attenuate flow.
   "Public stormwater open channel" means
      (1)   all open channels which convey, in part or in whole, stormwater;
      (2)   is an open channel which has a permanent drainage/stormwater
easement owned by the City of Reynoldsburg or is located within City of
Reynoldsburg owned property, and
      (3)   drains an area which includes City of Reynoldsburg owned property
or public right-of-way. A public stormwater open channel does not include
roadside ditches which convey only immediate right-of-way (roadside) drainage.
   "Retention facility" means a facility which provides storage of stormwater
runoff and is designed to eliminate subsequent surface discharges.
   "Routing" means an engineering technique described as computation of the
movement and attenuation of an inflow hydrograph as it passes through the
stormwater system, resulting in a discharge hydrograph at the downstream end of
an element such as a pipe, channel, or detention basin, and accounts
mathematically for the effects of storage on flow through the element. Level
pool routing assumes that a retention/detention facility maintains an "even" or
"level" surface water elevation.

(Ord. 46-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
959.03 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   This regulation of the Department of Safety Service, is adopted pursuant to
Reynoldsburg City Code, Ordinance 32-96, as authorized by the Director of the
Department of Safety Service.
(Ord. 46-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
959.04 PURPOSE.
   The stormwater service fee crediting mechanism has been developed with the
purpose of providing, to stormwater customers, a mechanism to reduce the
stormwater service fee in exchange for performing certain qualifying actions
which either reduces the impact of stormwater runoff from their property or
reduce the City's cost of providing stormwater management. This regulation sets
forth these qualifying actions and resulting reductions in stormwater service
fees.
(Ord. 46-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
959.05 CREDITING MECHANISM.
   (a)   All properties, other than single family residential properties, which
have constructed stormwater retention or detention facilities are eligible for
a percentage reduction, or credit, in that property's stormwater service fee.
   (b)   The minimum amount of reduction (credit) available for meeting minimum
retention/detention design, construction, and maintenance standards is 20
percent. The minimum 20 percent credit will be given to all eligible properties
which have constructed a retention/detention facility in accordance with City
policy, provided;
      (1)   such facility meets design, construction, and maintenance standards
in effect at the time of construction;
      (2)   for which a complete credit application form has been submitted;
      (3)   there has been provided to the City a signed right-of-entry by the
owner thereof; and
      (4)   there is paid to the City for such property a one-time, non-
refundable application/inspection fee of $250.00 for the first retention/
detention facility and $100.00 for each additional retention/detention facility
on the same property.
   (c)   The retention/detention credit is also available beyond the twenty
percent reduction under the following conditions:
   The amount of reduction, if any, is based upon the following:
         P = (0.8-0.3*(Qa/Qt))* 100
      where:
         P is the percent reduction in stormwater fee to be applied to the
property.
         Qa is the actual peak flow determined by calculating the peak flow of
a design storm from the retention/detention facility, using the "level pool
routing" technique.
         Qt is the target peak flow from the design criteria, as defined in the
Reynoldsburg Stormwater Management Policy.
   (d)   SCS standard methodologies shall be used for all calculations when
determining actual peak flow.
   (e)   The retention/detention credit beyond the twenty percent reduction is
available upon successful completion of the application process, including the
submittal of all necessary engineering calculations, documentation, proof of
required information, signed and stamped by a professional engineer registered
in the State of Ohio.
   (f)   The maximum amount of percent reduction (credit) available for
reducing discharge from the property to zero is 80 percent, but the City
Council of Reynoldsburg's permission is needed to obtain credit beyond the 50
percent level.
   (g)   Retention/detention credit is available only for those eligible
properties whose retention/detention facilities meet City design, construction
and maintenance standards.
   (h)   For facilities constructed after the effective date of this
regulation, the credit will be made effective to the later of either the date
of submittal of a successful application, or the date stormwater billing for
that property began (if all requirements and conditions of this rule and
regulation are met).
   (i)   Failure to operate or maintain the facility as designed shall be
reason for forfeiture of the credit. The City shall notify the property owner/
operator of the facility's deficiencies.

959.06 MAINTENANCE CREDITING MECHANISM.
   (a)   All properties other than single-family residential properties who
maintain public stormwater open channels are eligible to receive a direct cost
reduction (credit) in the property's stormwater service fee.
   (b)   To receive the credit, the property owner must:
      (1)   provide to the City a site plan at appropriate scale indicating the
open channel proposed to be maintained, and its tributary area;
      (2)   evidence that the channel meets the definition of public stormwater
open channel;
      (3)   evidence indicating the size of the tributary area to the open
channel;
      (4)   provide evidence of an easement dedicated to the City;
      (5)   provide a statement signed by the property owner releasing the City
from any assumed maintenance activities on the open channel;
      (6)   maintain the open channel to a minimal City standard.
   (c)   For public stormwater open channels draining an area of 10 acres or
larger, the property will receive a stormwater service fee credit of one dollar
($1.00) per year per lineal foot of public stormwater open channel maintained
and meeting all applicable sections of this regulation.
   (d)   For public stormwater open channels draining an area less than 10
acres, the property will receive a stormwater service fee credit of fifty cents
($0.50) per year per lineal foot of public stormwater open channel maintained
and meeting all applicable sections of this regulation.
   (e)   If all requirements and conditions of this section are met, the credit
will be applied to the property and become effective the date a completed
maintenance credit application was submitted.
   (f)   The credit received by the property owner alone or in combination with
all other stormwater credits received cannot exceed 100% of a customer's
stormwater service fee.
   (g)   The credit shall be in effect for a period of two years from the
effective date of the credit. After the initial application has been submitted
and approved in order to continue receiving the credit the customer shall, on a
biannual basis, submit a statement certifying that the public stormwater open
channel is being maintained to the standards included herein. The City shall,
prior to certifications being due, send notification to customers stating that
this certification is due.
   (h)   Failure to maintain the open channel to the minimum standards set
forth in this regulation shall be reason for forfeiture of a portion or all of
this credit. The City shall notify the property owner of this forfeiture and
actions necessary to receive full credit.

line at the average existing predevelopment grade of the lot directly beside
the structure, and the highest point of the coping of a flat roof, the top of a
mansard roof, the midpoint of any pitched gable, hip or the upper portion of a
gambrel roof, or measured between the top floor ceiling and the peak of the
roof on an “A” framed structure. Chimneys, elevators, poles, spires, tanks,
towers, and other projections not used for human occupancy are not included in

IMAGES/0-0-0-4739.png]
 
   (b)   Measuring Distance. When measuring a required distance, such as the
minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at
the closest or shortest distance between them.
   (c)   Measuring Setbacks.
      (1)   The front street setback is measured at a right angle from the
right-of-way line.
      (2)   Where a lot extends through the block from street to street, the
required front yard must be provided along each street.
      (3)   The side street setback is measured at a right angle from the side
street right-of-way line.
      (4)   The rear setback is measured at a right angle from the rear lot
line or the rear right-of-way or easement line where there is an alley. The
rear lot line is the lot line opposite to the front street lot line. Where
there is more than one (1) front street, the Planning and Zoning Administrator
will determine the rear lot line.
      (5)   All lot lines which do not front a street, side street or rear lot
lines are considered side interior lot lines.

      (6)   For the purpose of measuring setbacks, side interior setbacks are
measured at a right angle from the side lot line.

the average of the highest and lowest elevation along natural or improved grade
(whichever is more restrictive) along the front of the building parallel to the
front street setback line.

This chapter is divided into four (4) districts (the Olde Reynoldsburg Center,
(ORD-C) the Olde Reynoldsburg Neighborhood (ORD-N), the Brice and East Main
Street and the East Main Street Insight Districts) and five (5) zones.
Districts are specific contiguous geographies with the City that have similar
existing or desired development patterns. Districts may include numerous blocks
of different uses and building types that form the character of each district.
The regulations applied to each district respect the unique development pattern
while promoting desired outcomes within. Zones are not all contiguous and are
mapped across the City primarily based on existing and desired use patterns and
distinguish between disparate uses without respect to a specific geographies.

   (a)   Intent. Because of its location adjacent to the Olde Reynoldsburg
Neighborhood District (ORD-N) future development should support a more diverse
range of housing options and should be well integrated with surrounding uses
while allowing for more compact development to accommodate smaller household
sizes, an aging population, and a growing number of households without
children. Multi-unit buildings with common open spaces are encouraged where
appropriate, developments may include a range of housing options with different
price points and styles including stacked flats, higher density single-family,
row houses, and apartments. Reduced setbacks, improved streetscapes, and
smaller blocks all contribute to improved walkabilty.
   (b)   Allowed Building Types. The building types allowed in the ORD-N are
limited to the following, which shall be placed on lots with minimum dimensions
sufficient to accommodate the minimum building type and setback dimensions. See
Section

VIV. Design Guidelines for Olde Reynoldsburg
   A.   Purpose
   The purpose of this section is to:
      (1)   protect and enhance the Olde Reynoldsburg Commercial District's
(ORD-C) unique aesthetic character;
      (2)   support high quality streets and public spaces;
      (3)   encourage architecture that blends harmoniously with the natural
surroundings and neighboring development;
      (4)   safeguard property values and long-term economic assets; and
      (5)   carefully preserve the character the District's historic character
while permitting appropriate growth.
   B.   Intent and Applicability
   These design guidelines shall apply to non-residential development in the
ORD-N and ORD-C and are not intended to stifle innovative design or creativity.
Instead, these design guidelines are intended to serve as the minimum standards
applicable to non-residential development to ensure that new development and
redevelopment satisfied the purposes of the Olde Reynoldsburg Districts as
described herein. These design guidelines shall be applied by the Planning
Commission in conjunction with its review of applications for Certificates of
Appropriateness as described under Section
1109.21 hereof.
   C.   General Standards
      (1)   Size, Mass and Scale: The scale of buildings and accessory
structures (including canopies) shall be appropriate to the scale of
structures.
      (2)   Proportions of Bays and Openings: All building bays, including
porches, colonnades and porticos as appropriate, shall be square or vertical in
proportion, unless the design merits a horizontally-proportioned opening. Wall
openings, with the exception of transoms and storefronts, shall be square or
vertical in proportion. The facade of a proposed building should draw upon the
proportion and number of bays in surrounding buildings, as defined by windows,
doors, and column spacing, to establish a compatible scale.
      (3)   Building Materials: Building wall materials shall be combined on
each facade only horizontally, unless the building is broken vertically by a
change of plane, or a vertical architectural element. Heavier materials, such
as masonry and stucco, shall be located below lighter materials, such as cement
fiber or wood siding.
      (4)   Roof Forms: Where pitched roofs exist, primary roofs shall have a
minimum slope of 4:12, while ancillary roof slopes may be no less than 2:12.
      (5)   Garages and Accessory Structures: Attached garages, detached
garages, and other accessory structures shall be subordinate in height,
footprint, and proportion to the primary structure on the site, and shall be
compatible with the principal structure in terms of roof form, materials, and
color. Where a garage contains an accessory dwelling unit above, it may exceed
the height of the primary structure.
      (6)   Trash, Mechanical, Utility and Service Equipment and Areas
         i.   Loading docks, service areas, and trash disposal facilities
(e.g., trash and recycling receptacles, compactors, dumpsters) shall be hidden
or screened from view of streets, parks, squares, or significant pedestrian
spaces. Loading areas may be oriented toward adjoining developed properties
that are zoned for nonresidential uses, if such loading areas are screened from
view.
         ii.   Mechanical equipment, such as ventilation systems, commercial
exhaust fans, rooftop terminations, commercial cooling equipment, heating and
air conditioning units, TV antennas, and satellite dishes, shall be hidden or
screened from view. Lattice, open brick enclosures, or vegetation can be used
to conceal mechanical equipment. Screening material shall be properly
maintained. If vegetation is used for screening, the mature size of the
vegetation shall be considered so that equipment air flow will not be
compromised.
      (7)   Colors: Buildings and additional site elements — e.g., bollards,
arbors, drive-thru canopies, sign posts — shall not be painted in a color or
pattern that expresses corporate identity, to the extent that the paint color
or pattern is not consistent with the design standards of the district.
Fluorescent colors, such as ASHTO safety yellow, are also prohibited except
where required by a public agency.

1103.15 BRICE & EAST MAIN STREET AND EAST MAIN STREET INSIGHT DISTRICTS.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4765.png]
 
   (a)   Purpose and Intent.
      (1)   Brice and East Main Street and the East Main Street Insight
Districts are intended to create compact, mixed-use, walkable environments,
remove regulatory barriers, and encourage the establishment of local
enterprises (e.g. Main Street businesses, start-up makers and other platforms
such as shared work spaces, community hubs, and markets). By creating this type
of physical environment and reducing regulatory barriers in these two (2)
insight districts, investors and start-up businesses will be more likely to
deploy capital. This will, in turn, enhance community character and allow
existing businesses and residents to remain along with newer uses.
      (2)    The Brice and Main Street Insight District is intended to be more
of an urban, mixed-use zone or transit oriented development (TOD) that centers
around a transportation hub or multi-modal transportation and leverages the
area’s proximity to major public transportation routes.
      (3)    The East Main Street Insight District is intended to serve as a
transportation corridor lined with compact, mixed-use, development and with
standards to address the transition area where each corridor abuts adjoining
neighborhoods.
      (4)   Regulations found in the insight districts that are unique to both
zones include:
         A.   Transit supportive development standards: Walkways connecting
streets to buildings and locating buildings or pedestrian plazas close to
transit stops can set up development to accommodate future transit.
         B.   On-site facilities for pedestrian, bike, and vehicular travel:
Standards for bike parking and pedestrian access, particularly within one-
quarter (1/4) mile or not more than one-half (1/2) mile of a transit stop.
         C.   Adjusted regulations for nonconforming buildings and uses: Leaves
the nonconforming section of the Zoning Code intact on nuisances but more
lenient on improvements and adaptive re-use.
         D.   Right-sized application fees: Fees are adjusted to reflect the
policies of the community. If infill and suburban retrofit is a priority, fees
in those environments should be less.
         E.   Adjust front setback regulations: Amend front setback regulations
to specify setback ranges instead of just minimums.
         F.   Reduced parking requirements for affordable housing: The
reduction depends upon the urban/suburban context and public transportation
access.
         G.   Reduced minimum parking requirements: Requiring more parking than
is necessary is a financial barrier to development, wastes site area for
parking, and increases impervious surface.
   (b)   Insight District Uses. The following uses are either permitted or
conditional uses as indicated in the following table:

The following supplemental regulations shall apply to all development in the
Brice and Main Street and East Main Street Insight Zones. The intent of these
regulations to promote the development of the City’s auto-oriented corridors to
allow for more residential development and access to employment opportunities.
The standards and guidelines set forth herein are not intended to stifle
innovative design. Instead, these regulations should serve as minimum standards
and guidelines to ensure that new development and redevelopment advances the
purposes described under this section.
   (f)   Transit Supportive Development.
      (1)   Enable bus stops, pullouts, shelters, and appropriate road
geometry.
      (2)   Retail, office, institutional buildings provide convenient access
to transit:
         A.   Walkways connecting streets to buildings;
         B.   Within one-half (½) mile of transit stop: Bicycle facilities,
including bicycle racks and areas for storing scooters; and
         C.   At major transit stops:
            1.   Buildings located within twenty (20) feet or provide
pedestrian plaza;
            2.   Reasonably direct connection to buildings;
            3.    Accessibility for disabled persons;
            4.   Easement or dedication for shelter if transit provider
requests;
            5.   Lighting;
            6.    Accommodations for seating or leaning;
            7.   Bicycle facilities, including bike racks and areas for storing
scooters.
   (g)   Exceptions and Reductions in Parking Standards.
      (1)   There is no minimum number of required automobile parking spaces
for uses within Brice and Main Street and East Main Street Insight Zones. The
applicant may propose a parking standard that is different than the standard
under Section
1105.01 Off-Street Parking and Loading for review and action by the Planning
and Zoning Administrator.
         A.   Site has a bus stop with frequent transit service located
adjacent to it, and the site’s frontage is improved with a bus stop waiting
shelter, consistent with the standards of the applicable transit service
provider: Allow up to a twenty (20) percent reduction to the standard number of
automobile parking spaces;
         B.   Site has dedicated parking spaces for carpool or vanpool
vehicles: Allow up to a ten (10) percent reduction to the standard number of
automobile parking spaces;
         C.   Site has dedicated parking spaces for motorcycles, scooters, or
electric carts:
         D.   Site has more than the minimum number of required bicycle parking
spaces: Allow up to a five (5) percent reduction to the number of automobile
parking spaces.
   (h)   Lot Coverage Bonus.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Administrator, subject to review, may
approve increases to the lot coverage standards as follows:
         A.   Lot coverage may increase by up to one-half (½) square foot for
every one (1) square foot of proposed automobile parking area to be contained
in a parking structure, either above or below leasable ground floor space
(e.g., residential, commercial, or civic use), not to exceed a twenty (20)
percent increase in allowable coverage.
         B.   Lot coverage may increase by up to one-half (½) a square foot for
every one (1) square foot of proposed parking area paving that uses a City-
approved porous or permeable paving material (i.e., allowing stormwater
infiltration).
         C.   Lot coverage may increase by up to one-half (½) a square foot for
every one (1) square foot of City-approved water quality treatment area (e.g.,
vegetative swale or bio-filtration) to be provided on the subject site.
         D.   In approving increases in lot coverage under subsections A.
through C. of this section, the City may require additional landscape buffering
or screening, above that which is required by other provisions of this Code,
and may impose reasonable conditions of approval to ensure the ongoing
maintenance of parking areas and surface water management facilities.
         E.   Notwithstanding the lot coverage increases authorized by this
section, all other development standards of this chapter, and other applicable
provisions of this Code, must be met.
(Ord. 33-2020. Passed 3-23-20; Ord. 108-2020. Passed 12-14-20; Ord. 103-2021.
Passed 7-26-21.)
1103.17 SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL ZONE (SR).
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The Suburban Residential (SR) Zone is intended to
regulate all land in the City platted for medium-scale suburban single-unit
residential development. The existing development pattern in the SR Zone is
traditional single-family residential subdivisions with single-unit residential
structures. The desired development pattern in the SR Zone is to accommodate
multiple forms of single-family development, including attached single-family
dwellings. New development in the SR Zone should also promote pedestrian
connectivity and the retention of open space as an amenity. Where possible, new
residential development should be connected to trail systems and within a half-
mile walk from parks or significant open space.
   (b)   Uses. The following uses are either permitted or conditional uses as
indicated in the following chart:

1103.21   COMMUNITY COMMERCIAL ZONE (CC).
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The Community Commercial (CC) Zone is intended to
promote development patterns and businesses that are consistent with larger
retail and office-users, including companies with a workforce residing
throughout the region that is seeking the convenience of access from heavily-
traveled corridors. Existing development in the CC Zone is comprised of
traditional large lot retail development with surface parking. Future
development patterns in the CC Zone should accommodate changes in retail and
transportation, including smaller lots and smaller format retail uses.

1103.25 OPEN SPACE/SCHOOLS ZONE (OS).
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Open Space/Schools (OS) Zone is
to promote the health and well-being of the City’s residents. Desired forms of
development and open space preservation in these zones includes golf courses,
ball fields, playgrounds, natural passive areas, and neighborhood pocket parks.
Trails originating in these zones should serve as gateways to the City’s key
destinations, including Olde Reynoldsburg and other entertainment and dining
epicenters. Institutional uses such as schools are also encouraged in these
zones and will help to promote the growth and development of the City’s school
age population by providing access to adjacent open space opportunities.

1103.31 FRONTAGE TYPOLOGIES.
   The following frontage typologies cover the area between the building facade
and the front lot line or right-of-way and intended to ensure projects that
establish or reinforce the appropriate frontage character within Olde
Reynoldsburg District (ORD Commercial and ORD Neighborhood), consistent with
the goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (a)   Shopfront.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4795.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The shopfront is a traditional ground floor frontage
treatment designed for active commercial uses (typically retail and dining) and
a high degree of pedestrian activity between the public sidewalk and commercial
spaces. A shopfront treatment includes one (1) or more commercial tenant
storefronts consisting of large windows and a direct tenant entrance from the
sidewalk, typically at sidewalk grade. Storefront characteristics typically
include prominent entrances, primarily composed of glass, and tenant signage.
If not located in a zero (0) lot line condition (immediately behind the
sidewalk), the intervening front setback may be paved as an extension of the
sidewalk streetscape to the building facade. All or portions of the setback may
be designated for use as outdoor seating or dining/bar space. The setback may
also include landscaping, either at grade with the sidewalk along the building
foundation, or in raised beds or planters.
   (b)   Patio.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4793.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The patio frontage is used primarily to provide
outdoor seating associated with ground floor dining uses within a building. The
patio is a hardscaped area that may be located to the front or side of a
building between the building and sidewalk.
   (c)   Yard.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4791.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The yard is a typical landscape setback which may
consist of open lawn, landscape beds, or some combination of the two (2). It
may contain hardscape elements as a secondary feature and may be edged by a low
fence or masonry wall. Yards are typically at the same or similar grade as the
adjacent sidewalk and include a front walk connecting the public sidewalk to
the main entrance of a building (see Raised Yard as a variation). This is the
common frontage treatment for houses and other neighborhood-scale residential
buildings, and is typically combined with other a porch or stoop building
frontage. A yard may also be used for flex building types designed for any
combination of uses.
   (d)   Raised Yard.
      (1)   Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4789.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The Raised Yard Frontage Type is a variation of the
front yard. It generally represents an historic residential lot character in
which the front yard is elevated above the sidewalk, often in a sloped
condition and sometimes with a masonry retaining wall (often composed of dry-
laid limestone) at the sidewalk edge, or some combination of the two (2). The
raised yard is often a continuous frontage condition for multiple adjacent
lots. Front walks connecting the public sidewalk to the main building entrance
are typically terraced with a set of steps at or near the public sidewalk and a
second set of steps at the building facade, often at a front porch or stoop
(see Porch and Stoop Frontage Types). The raised yard differs from the terrace
frontage type in that buildings are typically set back farther from the street
and the yard primarily consists of turf lawn or landscaping.
   (e)   Porch.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4787.png]
 
      (2)    Description. Common frontage type for residential building types.
Porches should be an extension of the internal living space.
   (f)   Stoop.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4785.png]
 
      (2)    Description. Entry landing for buildings that have elevated first
floors to secure privacy for first floor windows. Stoops may have perimeter
railings and walls. Stoops can be covered or uncovered and can be located
anywhere along the building face.
   (g)   Terrace.
      (1)   Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4783.png]
 
      (2)    Description. In the Terrace Frontage Type, the main facade is at
or near the property line with an elevated terrace providing public circulation
along the facade. This Type can be used to provide at-grade access while
accommodating a grade change and is frequently used together with a shopfront.
Frequent steps up to the terrace are necessary to avoid dead walls and maximize
access. A terrace treatment differs from the Raised Yard Frontage type in that
the building is typically located closer to the sidewalk and the terraced
setback is architecturally integrated with the building facade, consisting of
more hardscape materials. Raised planters may be incorporated as part of a
terrace frontage.
   (h)   Forecourt.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4781.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The forecourt frontage treatment allows for a portion
of a building facade to be set farther back from the street, creating a
courtyard condition with street frontage. A forecourt condition may also be
created through the composition of three (3) separate buildings, oriented with
the central building setback farther from the others. A forecourt may include
open access to the public sidewalk with one (1) or more entrances into the
building, or may be fenced and elevated as a semi-private space, partially
visible from the public realm. The forecourt area typically includes a
combination of landscape and hardscape treatments, and may include outdoor
amenities and seating areas associated with the building(s).
   (i)   Streetwall.
      (1)    Typical lot configuration.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/7f4e425a9209e02cb9f8ab9b9420fe1ce73152a0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4779.png]
 
      (2)    Description. The streetwall frontage is used to create a
continuous and defined edge along parking lots where located in close proximity
to a street and sidewalk. Streetwalls are typically low (at or below waist
height of a passing pedestrian) and may be composed entirely of masonry, a
combination of decorative metal fencing with masonry columns, raised planters,
a landscape hedge treatment, or some combination of these. Masonry street walls
are typically designed to coordinate with the principal building architecture
and often are physically connected to the building facade. Street walls may be
interrupted with a pedestrian walk connection to the public sidewalk. For new
projects or redevelopment, street walls are intended for use along any portion
of lot frontage in which side or rear parking is located adjacent to or near
the public sidewalk, but are secondary to other frontage types associated with
the principal building and should not dominate the entire lot frontage.
Streetwalls are also an effective design approach to improve existing auto-
oriented sites for which all or substantial portions of a primary frontage
consist of parking.

purposes of this chapter, a boat stored on a boat trailer shall be deemed one
(1) piece of recreational equipment.
         C.   Under no circumstances shall any recreational vehicle or
equipment be occupied or used for living, sleeping, housekeeping, storage or
business purposes.
         D.   No such recreational vehicle shall be parked in any manner in
which such vehicle may be deemed, in the professional opinion of the Planning
and Zoning Administrator, to obstruct the view of traffic in a manner that
endangers the safety of motorists or pedestrians.
   (d)   Conversion of Use. No parking or loading space (including a
residential garage) which is required by this Zoning Code shall be removed or
converted to another use unless the parking or loading requirement is satisfied
by the existence or construction of an additional parking or loading space
conforming to this Zoning Code.
   (e)   Required Parking and Loading Spaces.
      (1)   Required parking spaces. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
number of off-street parking spaces provided for a use shall not be less than
set forth in the table identified as “Table 1105.01A: Required Parking Spaces.”
The number of parking and loading spaces required for a use shall be as
determined by the Zoning Administrator in conformance with the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Requirements for unlisted use. For a use for which off-street
parking requirements have not been specifically stated in this Zoning Code,
parking and loading facilities shall be provided as determined by the Zoning
Administrator to be sufficient for the parking and loading needs of the
proposed use and structures, giving consideration to the following criteria:
         A.   The number of off-street parking spaces required for a use listed
in the table that is the most similar to the proposed use in terms of
anticipated parking demand;
         B.   The floor area of the proposed use;
         C.   The anticipated number of employees and patrons; and
         D.   Any evidence submitted regarding the parking demand for the same
use on similar existing sites.
      (3)   Calculation for certain uses. For uses for which required parking
is based on number of dwelling units, floor area, seats, or beds, the number of
required parking spaces shall be determined from drawings provided by the
applicant and may be further confirmed by measurement of the actual built floor
area. When calculation of required parking results in a fraction, then the
fraction shall be rounded to the next higher whole number.
      (4)   Calculation for mixed-uses. For properties having mixed or multiple
uses, the number of required parking spaces shall be the sum of those required
for the various uses computed separately, except as otherwise provided.
   (f)   Minimum Off-Street Parking Space Requirement Reductions.
      (1)   Minimum off-street parking space reduction standards. The minimum
number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 1105.01A may be reduced
for a land use or land uses upon approval of an application demonstrating one
(1) or more of the off-street parking space reduction conditions set forth
under divisions (f)(2), (f)(5), (f)(6), or (f)(7) below; provided however,
under no circumstances shall the cumulative reduction of minimum parking spaces
exceed thirty (30) percent of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces
required for a land use.
      (2)   Shared parking plan. Where a mix of land uses on one (1) or more
properties or within one (1) or more buildings can demonstrate parking
utilization in staggered peak periods, a shared parking plan may be approved by
the Planning and Zoning Administrator to reduce the minimum number of required
off-street parking spaces for the applicable land use(s). A shared parking plan
for the reduction of off-street parking requirements may be submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Administrator subject to the following requirements:
         A.   Shared parking plans must incorporate parking facilities located
within five hundred (500) feet of the subject property or subject properties;
and
         B.   To the greatest extent practicable, adjacent lots included in a
shared parking plan shall be connected for vehicular passage and shall provide
safe and efficient pedestrian access to all uses served by the parking
facilities.
      (3)   Review of shared parking plan. A decision pertaining to an
application for a shared parking plan shall be based on the following factors:
         A.   The number of parking spaces otherwise required for the land uses
that will share the parking facilities designated in the shared parking plan;
         B.   Documentation that the peak parking utilization for the land uses
occurs at different days and/or times;
         C.   The demonstrated accessibility of the shared parking facilities;
and
         D.   Such other relevant documentation as the applicant(s) may provide
to the City in conjunction with a parking reduction application.
      (4)   Effect of approval of shared parking plan. When a shared parking
plan application is approved, the modified number of required off-street
parking spaces for the applicable land uses shall be the largest number of
parking spaces needed for the applicable land uses during the most intensive
time period of parking utilization as demonstrated by the evidence presented
with the application.
      (5)   Auto-share parking spaces. The required minimum number of off-
street parking spaces for a land use may be reduced by up to four (4) off-
street parking spaces for each off-street parking space that is reserved for
auto-share parking; provided however the satisfaction of this parking reduction
condition may not result in an off-street parking space reduction in excess of
ten (10) percent. Auto-share parking spaces shall be designed in a plan to be
submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Administrator; such plan must
propose how the auto-share parking spaces will be reserved for auto-share
parking.
      (6)   Transit proximity. The required minimum number of off-street
parking spaces for a land use or land uses may be reduced by up to ten (10)
percent if more than fifty (50) percent of the subject property is located
within one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet of any public transit stop. If an
existing transit stop is subsequently eliminated, any previously permitted
parking reduction shall remain valid, provided that an active transit route
remains within one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet of the development.
      (7)   Bike lockers and shower facilities. The required minimum number of
off-street parking spaces for a non-residential development may be reduced by
five (5) percent if such development contains shower and clothing and bike
locker facilities for bicycle commuting employees. The required minimum number
of off-street parking spaces for a multi-family development may be reduced by
five (5) percent if such development contains interior bicycle parking for
residents. In each case, the reduction shall apply only to that portion of the
minimum off-street parking requirement attributable to the employees or
residents that have access to the shower and locker facilities.
      (8)   Review and revocation. Upon the grant of a reduction in the minimum
number of off-street parking spaces hereunder, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator shall periodically review the land uses associated with any
approval to determine compliance with such approval. If the Planning and Zoning
Administrator determines upon review of any approved application that the terms
of any approved plan are not being complied with, then the Planning and Zoning
Administrator may revoke such approval, and the applicable land use shall be
required to satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirement otherwise set
forth under Table 1105.01A hereof.
   (g)   Parking and Loading Design Standards.
      (1)   Location. A parking space required for a dwelling unit shall be
provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit. The standard size for a parking
space installed in accordance with these provisions shall be nine (9) feet by
eighteen (18) feet. A parking space required for a use other than a dwelling
unit shall be located on the same lot as the use, except that some or all of
such required spaces may be located on another lot within three hundred (300)
feet of the use if authorized in the approval of the site plan. Parking or
loading facilities shall not be permitted on the right-of-way of any publicly
dedicated thoroughfare, except as provided by a public authority.
      (2)   Setbacks. Off-street parking and loading facilities, with the
exception of driveways leading from the public right-of-way to aisles or
spaces, shall be located as follows:
         A.   Required unenclosed parking spaces for attached single-family,
detached single-family, two-family, and multi-unit dwellings may be provided on
paved areas within the front yard required for such structure. Parking shall
not be permitted on unpaved areas;
         B.   No part of any parking lot shall be located closer than five (5)
feet to a public right-of-way;
         C.   Parking may be located in the required front yard in any
industrial district, but not closer than twenty (20) feet to a public right-of-
way;
         D.   In any commercial district, parking shall not be located in the
area between the frontage and the front setback. The area between the frontage
and the front setback shall be improved as a grass and or planting area.
Ingress and/or egress through this planting area shall be restricted to a
driveway or driveways not to exceed thirty (30) feet in width. Under no
circumstances will service roads and or driveways parallel to the right-of-way
be permitted, the grass and/or planting area and driveways are to be made a
part of the plot-grade-utility plan and are to be approved by the Service
Director and City Engineer.
      (3)   Screening. Any parking lot which contains more than ten (10)
parking spaces and which is located closer than fifty (50) feet to the lot line
of any lot which is used for a dwelling, school, hospital, or other institution
for human care shall be screened by a fence, wall, or hedge of acceptable
design installed at each edge of the parking lot which faces the use noted
above. Such fence, wall, or hedge shall be no less than four (4) feet nor more
than six (6) feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition without
any advertising thereon. The space between such fence, wall, or hedge and the
lot line of the adjoining premises shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs
or evergreen ground cover and maintained in good condition.
      (4)   Access. Adequate ingress and egress from the public right-of-way
and within the lot shall be provided for all parking and loading spaces. Access
for all parking and loading facilities (except those required for attached
single-family, detached single-family and two-family dwellings) shall be
designed to permit any vehicle entering or leaving the premises to be traveling
in a forward motion. Driveways shall be located to minimize conflict with
vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the public right-of-way. Driveways and
service roads shall not be located parallel to the right-of-way. Driveways for
non-residential uses shall not exceed thirty 30) feet in width at the right-of-
way line nor more than thirty (30) feet at the curb cut line of the street
unless otherwise approved by the individual or administrative body reviewing
the site plan for the subject property.
      (5)   ADA requirements. All parking facilities that require accessible
parking spaces shall ensure that a portion of the total number of required
parking spaces are specifically designated, located, and reserved for use by
persons with physical disabilities, in accordance with the standards in the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The following standards apply:
         A.   The closest parking spaces to the main entrance shall be devoted
to the required accessible parking spaces; and
         B.   At least one (1) accessible parking space shall be twelve (12)

driveways, and aisles. Access to loading spaces shall be designed to prevent
interference with the public right-of-way.
         B.   At least one (1) loading space shall be provided for every
building having a floor area of up to ten thousand (10,000) square feet and one
(1) additional loading space shall be provided for each additional ten thousand
(10,000) square feet, or major fraction thereof.

      (8)   Paving and improvements.
         A.   All required parking and loading facilities shall be paved with a
durable, dust-free surface such as asphalt or concrete.
         B.   Parking facilities shall be designed to direct surface water into
an adequate storm drainage system. Drainage of surface water onto adjacent
properties, walkways, or public streets is prohibited.
         C.   Paint lines shall be installed and maintained to mark the
locations of all parking and loading spaces. Wheel blocks shall be installed

days of the date on which a non-residential use of a lot is terminated, the
owner shall install a barricade at all points of vehicular access in a manner
approved by the Zoning Administrator.
   (i)   Reserved Parking Lot. In conjunction with the site plan and design
review, the applicable reviewing individual or administrative body may approve,
upon request of the applicant and review of the site plan, construction of
fewer parking spaces than required by Table 1105.01A for a proposed use and
site development. In making such determination, the reviewing individual or
administrative body shall nevertheless require that the additional area needed
to accommodate the required number of parking spaces be reserved as landscaped
open areas on the lot. The layout and design of the parking spaces, aisles, and
drives of such reserved parking lot shall be indicated on the approved site
plan and shall comply with provisions of this Zoning Code.

screening unsightly areas, preserving the integrity of neighborhoods and
enhancing pedestrian and vehicular traffic and safety.
   (b)   Application. The Planning and Zoning Administrator may require a
landscape plan and/or tree survey to be submitted in conjunction with any
application for a zoning certificate, a variance, a conditional use permit, a
similar use determination, a subdivision plat, or a site plan and design review
approval. Such landscape plan and/or tree survey shall include the following:
      (1)   The present location, size, and description of all existing major
trees, with a designation of existing major trees sought to be removed.
      (2)   The location, size and description of landscaping materials
proposed to be placed on the lot in order to comply with this section.
      (3)   The location and size of any structures presently on the lot, and
those proposed to be placed on the lot.
      (4)   The proposed location and description of screening to be placed on
the lot in order to comply with this section.
   (c)   General Landscape Provisions.
      (1)   When required by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a landscape
plan shall be approved in accordance with this chapter prior to granting a
zoning certificate, a variance, a conditional use permit, a similar use
determination, a subdivision plat, or a site plan and design review. A zoning
certificate is not required for the addition of pervious surface including
grass, mulched groundcover, other planted areas, and/or permeable or pervious
pavers or paving that facilitates the infiltration of water into the soil.
      (2)   No landscaped area shall be used for display and/or storage
purposes.

      (4)   No certificate of occupancy shall be granted until all conditions
herein have been met; however, in the event landscaping cannot be completed due
to weather conditions, or peculiar conditions related to the development of the
subject property such as conditions related to phased development, the
applicant shall provide financial security, in a form acceptable to the City,
in the amount of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the cost of materials
and installation of all remaining landscaping to be completed and an estimate
of such costs in order to be eligible for a certificate of occupancy.
      (5)   When phasing development upon a property, a proportionate share of
landscaping acceptable to the City shall be installed and maintained with each
phase based on the size of the proposed phase and shall be considered completed
for the purposes of these regulations when such proportionate share of
landscaping has been installed, unless special circumstances warrant the
installation of a greater amount of landscaping with any phase.
      (6)   The developer and/or property owner shall be responsible for the
installation and maintenance of all landscaping, buffering, perimeter treatment
and screening improvements in a healthy condition. This provision shall also

or flowers, or if covered by decorative rock, stone or wood chips, or otherwise
landscaped as provided herein. This provision shall also apply to single-family
and two-family dwellings.
      (8)   These landscaping provisions are not intended to require multiple
or overlapping setbacks, buffers and perimeter treatments. When more than one
(1) such standard applies, that standard which results in the higher
landscaping or buffering requirement shall apply. Buffering and perimeter
treatments may be located within the required setbacks and may be counted
toward required open space except not as usable open space.
      (9)   Utility easements which conflict with required buffer yards,
perimeter treatment, parkway or median standards may require an alternative
design approach to address such conflicts.
   (d)   Tree Preservation. Unless exempted in accordance with this subsection,
all existing major trees shall be preserved. The Building Inspector may approve

the public shall not be specified for use.
      (6)   If any trees or other plant materials die or become diseased and
must be removed, the property owner shall be responsible for replacing all
materials that were removed. In the event that existing preserved trees die or
become diseased and must be removed; the replacement shall be based on the tree
credits
Table 1105.07A. If trees or shrubs are removed for convenience purposes, the
property owner shall be responsible for replacing all removed materials
elsewhere on the site. If adequate space is not available on the site, the
replacement shall occur at a location approved by the City. Upon issuance of a
citation, corrective action shall be completed within sixty (60) days unless
the Development Director or designee determines that weather constraints
require one (1) additional sixty (60) day period. Failure to meet the
requirements of this section shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Code
and the penalty requirements shall apply.
      (7)   Trees and shrubs shall be planted so that at maturity they do not
interfere with utility service lines and traffic safety. Trees planted near

      (4)   No new tree plantings shall be required if existing trees to remain
on the site after development, and the aggregate trunk sizes of such trees,
meet or exceed the requirements as set forth above.
      (5)   Any combination of existing and new trees may be used to meet the
requirements of this section.
   (i)   Property Buffer Requirements.
      (1)   Grass or ground cover required. Grass or ground cover shall be
planted on all portions of the required buffer not occupied by other landscape
material. Trees do not have to be equally spaced but may be grouped. All
landscape requirements shall be met by the applicant if his/her property is
contiguous to property fully developed prior to the passage of this chapter. A
landscape plan meeting the requirements of this section shall be approved by
the Planning Commission or the Planning and Zoning Administrator in conjunction
with the site plan and design review process before the commencement of
construction on the subject property.
      (2)   Buffer requirements. When one zoning classification abuts another
zoning classification, a minimum buffer zone shall be required as follows:

      (6)   Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped area no more
than two and one-half (2½) feet. Concrete or other wheel stops shall be
provided to ensure no greater overhang on the landscaped area. Where parked
vehicles will overhang, a four (4)-foot minimum spacing shall be provided from
the edge of pavement to all trees.
      (7)   Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the
required landscaping area not occupied by other landscape material. Such
material fulfills required interior or perimeter landscaping.
   (k)   Screening and Landscaping for Service Structures. In order to properly
screen service structures from the main building and neighboring lots, the
following screening requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Location of screening. Either a solid, opaque fence or wall or
earth berm, with a continuous planting of evergreen plant material shall
enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structure must be
frequently accessed, in which case screening on all but one (1) side is
required. The average height of the screening fence or wall shall be one (1)
foot more than the height of the enclosed structure but shall not exceed the
maximum permitted height of fences and walls of the District.
      (2)   Mechanical equipment and service functions associated with a
building shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be incorporated into the
overall design theme of the building and the landscape so that these functions
are out of view from public ways and adjacent properties while allowing
convenient access.
      (3)   Plant material required for screening of service structures shall
not count towards the fulfillment of other landscape requirements in this
section. No interior landscaping shall be required within an area screened for
service structures.
      (4)   Curbs to protect plant material. Whenever plant material is placed
around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied or
removed mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the placement of the
container shall be provided adjacent to the plant material. The curbing shall
be at least one (1) foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent
possible damage to the plant material when the container is moved or emptied.
      (5)   Service structures shall be grouped together whenever possible.
      (6)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to service
structures located on lots with single-family and two-family dwellings, except
that any generator located within six (6) feet of any lot line shall be
screened in accordance with this section.
   (l)   Natural Preservation Zones.
      (1)   Applicability. Natural preservation zones are areas that protect
both the aesthetic appearance and environmental significance including, but not
limited to, woodlands, wetlands, ravines, flood plains, streams, lakes, ponds,
and/or steep slopes and can provide effective buffers between different or same
land uses. Such zones should be designated on the concerned property. It is the
intent of this section to encourage the use of these preservation zones in new
developments including single- family subdivisions, multi family, commercial
and industrial construction. It is the further intent of this section not to
preclude and/or prevent development, but to protect and preserve
environmentally significant areas by fostering the use of buffer zones that
could be integrated within the development. Preservation zones shall be used in
a manner to promote and protect the public safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare of the City.
      (2)   Determination of preservation zones.
         A.   Environmentally significant areas shall be required to have a
preservation zone(s). (The natural resources maps A and B in the Reynoldsburg
Planning Guide are guides in determining the environmentally significant areas.
These maps shall be a guide in determining areas that shall be required to have
preservation zones.)
         B.   However, this shall not preclude the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or the Planning Commission from recommending and/or approving
preservation zones in other areas that are considered to be environmentally
significant. In determining preservation zones, the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or the Planning Commission determines that the area needs to be
protected from development and which could serve as a buffer between different
or same uses.
      (3)   Approval of preservation zones. Preservation zones shall be
approved in accordance with the following procedures:
         A.   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve a
preservation zone for a subdivision and/or a planned district. This approval
shall occur during the preliminary plat stage and shall follow the procedures
set out in
Chapter 1111. The Planning and Zoning Administrator may recommend to the
Planning Commission the location of a preservation zone.
         B.   Preservation zones shall become part of the final plat or final
development plan for subdivisions by the Planning Commission and approved by
Council. Preservation zones shall become part of the site plan that is part of
the certificate of appropriateness approval.
      (4)   Protection of preservation zones.
         A.   Before any activity, clearing, and/or construction begins, the
entire preservation zone shall be enclosed with at least three (3) foot high
orange construction fencing to prevent any access to the area. Such fencing
shall protect the root systems of vegetation within the preservation zone. The
fencing can only be taken down for an individual lot when an occupancy permit
has been issued for the structure on the concerned lot. The fencing shall
remain on the undeveloped lots until occupancy permits are granted for each
lot.
         B.   Said preservation zone shall not be disturbed any time before,
during, or after said construction except for necessary access as approved by
the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
         C.   No permanent or temporary structure, building, or fence shall
ever be placed upon, in, or under said preservation zone.
         D.   Utilities and roadways in preservation zones may only be
installed consistent with an Environmental Plan and/or Mitigation Plan.
         E.   No development, clearing, thinning, construction, or work shall
be performed in the preservation zone except for necessary construction as
deemed necessary by the Planning and Zoning Administrator. If a preservation
zone is disturbed at any time (including but not limited to utility
construction and/or easement, building or grading construction) by the
developer, contractor, subcontractor, house builder, property owner, or a
representative, such disturbances that occur shall be restored to an approved
condition. Diseased trees and/or diseased vegetation may be removed with the
approval of the Planning and Zoning Administrator. Obnoxious weeds and/or brush
of less than one (1) inch caliper may be removed without destroying the
integrity of the preservation zone.
         F.   No dirt, stones, wood, or debris shall be placed within the
preservation zone.
         G.   Trees located in a preservation zone that have been pushed over,
cut apart, blown over, or fallen due to aging and/or deterioration are the
property owner’s responsibility to remove from the preservation zone.
         H.   A utility company servicing and/or installing utilities in the
designated preservation zone shall also be subject to these restrictions.
         I.   These restrictions shall be printed on the final plat, the final
development plan, and/or site plan.
         J.   Drainage shall not be changed in a manner that will damage the
preservation zone.
         K.   The developer shall notify each property purchaser in the
concerned subdivision and/or the development of the preservation zone
requirements. Such notification shall be in writing and shall be submitted to
the property purchaser at the time of closing.
         L.   The developer shall notify all contractors, utility companies,
and/or cable companies doing work in the concerned subdivision of the
preservation zone requirements.

1105.09   EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
   (a)   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this section is to ensure
that all exterior site and building lighting shall not affect the reasonable
use and enjoyment of adjacent properties but provide minimum levels to enhance
safety of individuals and property. Lighting standards shall also protect the
safety and operation of vehicles on the public rights-of-way from levels of
illumination that are emitted or reflected from light sources of an intensity
sufficiently to constitute a safety hazard to vehicular movement. Lighting
standards shall apply to all lots except those developed with single- family or
two-family dwellings.
   (b)   Exterior Lighting Regulations. Exterior site lighting shall be
designed, located, constructed and maintained to minimize light and reflected
light trespass and spill over off the subject property. Glare shall be
minimized from all light sources.
      (1)   The average horizontal illumination level on the ground shall not
exceed three (3) footcandles. The light level along a property line adjacent to
a residentially-zoned or used property shall not exceed an average intensity of
one-half (½) footcandle.
      (2)   The height of parking lot lighting shall not exceed twenty (20)
feet above grade and shall direct light downward, i.e. cut-off type fixtures.
In conjunction with a major site plan review, the Planning Commission may
require a lower standard based upon specific characteristics of the site.
      (3)   The color of parking lot lighting poles and other lighting
infrastructure shall match or complement the colors of the building’s
architecture, as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   For pedestrian areas, decorative low light fixtures shall be used
and the height of the fixture shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet above grade.
      (5)   Exterior building illumination shall be from concealed sources.
Strobe or flashing lights and exposed neon lights are not permitted. Lighting
fixtures shall not generate excessive light levels, cause glare, or direct
light beyond the facades onto neighboring property, streets, or the night sky.
The maximum illumination of any vertical surface or angular roof surface shall
not exceed four (4) footcandles.
      (6)   Security lighting shall be full, cut-off type fixtures, shielded
and aimed so that illumination is directed to the designated areas with the
lowest possible illumination level to effectively allow surveillance.
      (7)   Lighting fixtures used to illuminate the area below a freestanding
canopy shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the
bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy. However, indirect lighting may be used
where a shielded source of light is beamed upward and then reflected down from
the underside of the canopy.

continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this Code, and no
portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Code, nor
shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or area
below the requirements stated in this Code.
(Ord. 33-2020. Passed 3-23-20; Ord. 103-2021. Passed 7-26-21.)
1107.11 ALTERATION OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE.
   (a)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a
manner which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof
may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   If lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code
that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Code, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code
in the zone or district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone or district in which it
is located.
      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any of the parts
of a building which were manifestly arranged or designated for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this Code, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the applicable zone or district, and the non-conforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (4)   Where a non-conforming use has been discontinued, meaning that the
structure containing the use has remained vacant, unoccupied, unused or has
ceased the daily activities or operations which had occurred, for a period of
three (3) or more continuous months, the non-conforming use shall be
permanently terminated.
      (5)   Any non-conforming structure damaged to an extent of more than
seventy-five (75) percent of its then fair market value, exclusive of
foundations, shall not be restored or reconstructed, used or occupied as a non-
conforming use. If such damage amounts to seventy-five (75) percent or less of
the fair market value, the nonconforming structure may be restored, provided a
building permit is obtained and that such restoration shall begin within one
(1) year from the time of damage. The BZBA may approve the reconstruction of a
non-conforming structure damaged to a greater extent than permitted herein upon
review of a site and design plan submitted in accordance with the requirements
for site and design plan submittal under
Chapter 1109.

structure was established in conformance with the zoning provisions in effect
prior to adoption of this Code, and provided that such use or structure was

non-conforming use or structure and shall be permitted to continue under the
provisions of this Code.

accordance with the provisions set forth hereunder.
   (b)   No use of land, building or structure and no construction or

and approved in conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Code. A zoning

The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall not be required to issue a zoning

   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this Code, a zoning certificate shall
be required before:
   (d)   An application for a zoning certificate shall be submitted to the

application for a zoning certificate does not comply with the provisions or
intent of this Code, or that an application does not provide sufficient
information to determine compliance with this Code, then the Planning and
Zoning Administrator shall deny the application and shall not issue a zoning
certificate.
   (f)   The Planning and Zoning Administrator may refer zoning certificates to
the BZBA for review.
   (g)   Within fourteen (14) days of the Planning and Zoning Administrator’s

(Ord. 33-2020. Passed 3-23-20; Ord. 103-2021. Passed 7-26-21.)
1109.13 VARIANCES.
   (a)   The provisions set forth hereunder shall apply to the review and grant
of variances under this Code.
   (b)   An applicant seeking a variance shall submit a written request for
variance on forms provided by the Planning Zoning Administrator together with
the applicable fee. In addition to information relating to the subject property
and the applicant, the request for a variance shall include the following
information:
      (1)   A description of the nature of the variance requested and a
statement demonstrating the extent to which the requested variance conforms to
the standards for variance in this Code;
      (2)   A statement of hardship; and
      (3)   Such other information and exhibits as may be appropriate to
establish the facts of the appeal and the grounds for relief.
   (c)   Before approving or denying a request, the BZBA shall hold at least
one (1) public hearing on the matter. The BZBA shall cause notice of the
hearing to be made to the public by seven (7) days advance publication, in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City, of the place, time, date and the
nature of the variance applied for. The BZBA shall also cause the subject
property to be posted with a notice of hearing at least seven (7) days prior to
the day of the hearing. The notice of hearing shall state thereon the nature of
the request and the time and place of the public hearing.
   (d)   No variance from the strict application of the provisions of this Code
shall be granted unless the BZBA makes specific findings of fact, based on the
evidence presented to it, which support conclusions that the variance conforms
to the following standards:
      (1)   The variance is in accord with the general purpose and intent of
the regulations imposed by this Code in the district in which it is located,
and shall not be injurious to the area or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare.
      (2)   The variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is
not otherwise listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in the zone or
district in which the subject property is situated.
      (3)   There exist special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the findings, applicable to the land or structures for which the variance is
sought, which are peculiar to such land or structures and which do not apply
generally to land or structures in the area, and which are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Code would deprive the property owner of
the reasonable use of such land or structures. There must be a deprivation of
the beneficial use of land, as opposed to mere loss in value as justification
for the variance.
      (4)   There is proof of hardship or practical difficulty created by the
strict application of this Code, beyond simply a showing that greater profit
will result if the variance is granted. Economic hardship is not grounds for
the variance. Furthermore, the hardship complained of is not self-created nor
is it established on this basis by one who purchased with or without knowledge
of the restrictions. The hardship results from the application of this Code and
is suffered directly by the property in question.
      (5)   The variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or
building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
      (6)   The variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets,
increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially
diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
      (7)   The variance will not confer on the property owner any special
privilege that is unduly denied by this Code to other land, structures, or
buildings in the same district.
      (8)   No nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of land or structures in other
districts are considered as grounds for approval of the variance.
      (9)   The variance is not a matter of convenience when other remedies are
available within the provisions of this Code.
   (e)   In granting any variance, the BZBA shall establish such conditions as
are necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this Code. Any
violation of such conditions and safeguards, when they have been made a part of
the terms under which the variance has been granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Code.
   (f)   No action of the BZBA granting a variance shall be valid for a period
longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such action unless the zoning
certificate is obtained within such period, and the erection or alteration of a
structure is started or the use is commenced within such period, provided
however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, such twelve (12)
month period may be extended by the Planning and Zoning Administrator upon the
demonstration by the applicant that any delay in the commencement of the
erection or alteration of a structure is the result of factors beyond the
control of the applicant, in which case, the Planning and Zoning Administrator
may elect to grant an extension of up to six (6) months.
   (g)   The BZBA shall not accept a new application for a variance that has
been previously denied within twelve (12) months of denial.
(Ord. 33-2020. Passed 3-23-20; Ord. 103-2021. Passed 7-26-21.)
1109.15 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Reviews of applications for conditional uses shall be conducted by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator in accordance with the provisions set forth
under this section; provided however, if, the Planning and Zoning Administrator
determines in his or her professional opinion that an application warrants
public review, then the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall forward such
application to the BZBA for review. The intent of the procedure for authorizing
a conditional use is to set forth the development standards and criteria for
locating and developing conditional uses in harmony with the character of the
surrounding area, conditions of development and with regard to appropriate
laws.
   (b)   In addition to such standard information regarding the subject
property and the applicant, the application for a conditional use shall contain
the following:
      (1)   Description of the zoning district and existing uses of adjacent
lots;
      (2)   A statement of the conditional use for which the application is
submitted;
      (3)   Including a description of the activities proposed on the subject
property, the goods and services sold or provided, hours of operation,
anticipated number of employees, nature and volume of delivery activity, and
other information which will assist the BZBA with understanding the nature of
the proposed use and its potential impacts;
      (4)   A plan of the proposed site and improvements showing the proposed
location of all structures, parking and loading areas, streets and traffic
accesses, open spaces, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards,
landscaping, and other relevant features;
      (5)   A narrative statement describing the compatibility of the proposed
use with the existing uses of adjacent lots and with the Land Use Plan,
including an evaluation of the effects on adjoining lots of such elements as
traffic circulation, noise, glare, odor, fumes, vibration, and storm water, and
any measures proposed to mitigate such effects;
      (6)   A narrative addressing each of the applicable criteria set forth in
the standards and requirements for all conditional uses set forth below and, as
applicable, the supplementary requirements for special uses set forth under the
applicable district or zone regulations.
      (7)   Such other information as the BZBA deems necessary to make a
determination of the compliance of the proposed use with the applicable
standards and regulations. Such additional information may include, but shall
not be limited to:
         A.   Traffic impact analysis;
         B.   Storm water impact analysis; and/or
         C.   Utility impact analysis.
   (c)   When review of an application for a conditional use permit is
forwarded by the Planning and Zoning Administrator to the BZBA, before
approving or denying a request for a conditional use, the BZBA shall hold at
least one (1) public hearing on the matter. The BZBA shall cause notice of the
hearing to be made in accordance with its standard process for providing notice
of a hearing. The notice of hearing shall state thereon the nature of the
request and the time and place of the public hearing.
   (d)   Upon reviewing an application for a conditional use, the Planning and
Zoning Administrator or the BZBA, as applicable, shall consider whether the
application provides adequate evidence that the proposed conditional use is
consistent with the following standards:
      (1)   The proposed use shall be in harmony with the existing or intended
character of the zone or district and nearby affected zones and districts and
shall not change the essential character of the zones and districts;
      (2)   The proposed use shall not adversely affect the use of adjacent
property;
      (3)   The proposed use shall not adversely affect the health, safety,
morals, or welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood;
      (4)   The proposed use shall be served adequately by public facilities
and services such as, but not limited to, roads, police and fire protection,
storm water facilities, water, sanitary sewer, and schools;
      (5)   The proposed use shall not impose a traffic impact upon the public
right-of-way significantly different from that anticipated from permitted uses
of the zone or district;
      (6)   The proposed use shall be in accord with the general and specific
objectives, and the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and the Land Use
Plan and any other plans and ordinances of the City;
      (7)   The proposed use complies with the applicable specific provisions
and standards of this Code;
      (8)   The proposed use shall be found to meet the definition and intent
of a use specifically listed as a conditional use in the zone or district in
which the subject property is situated.
   (e)   After review of the application and any additional information
presented by the applicant, the Planning and Zoning Administrator or the BZBA,
as applicable, shall take action to:
      (1)   Approval the conditional use, based upon findings of compliance
with the standards and requirements of this Code and subject to conditions to
ensure compliance with this Code; or

structure or building not to be in operation, the permit and zoning certificate
shall be deemed revoked and the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify
the applicant of such revocation as well as the BZBA. Upon such revocation, the
applicant shall have the right to appeal that decision of the Planning and
Zoning Administrator to the BZBA and request the BZBA allow up to one (1)
additional six (6) month period to begin operation following the administrative
appeal procedure.
   (j)   Whenever the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that a
conditional use is being operated in a manner that violates any condition of
the use’s approved permit, the permit and zoning certificate shall be
considered revoked. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the
permit holder as such, who shall immediately discontinue operation of the use:
      (1)   If this determination is made in conjunction with the six (6) month

upon request of the permit holder. Any amendment proceeding shall be conducted
in accordance with the procedures, requirements, and standards applicable to
review of a new conditional use permit.
   (m)   Subsequent to disapproval of an application for a conditional use
permit, a period of at least one (1) year shall elapse before another
application for the same conditional use at the location may be considered by
the Planning and Zoning Administrator or the BZBA.
   (n)   Appeals of decisions of the Planning and Zoning Administrator may be

variance with existing non-residential structures within such district. In
considering the new construction or alteration, the Planning Commission shall
evaluate the application based on whether the proposal:

necessary to ensure that the owner shall make or has made provision for all
utility services, including underground electric and telephone distribution
wires, conduits, cables, gas pipelines, sewer and water lines in accordance
with this section, adequate for the anticipated needs of the subdivision.
      (4)   The construction of all underground facilities shall meet the
minimum requirements of any code approved by the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio.
      (5)   If, in the opinion of the owner of any subdivision or a portion

   (a)   The City of Reynoldsburg has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base.
   (b)   Additionally, structures that are inadequately; elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the

incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purpose, these regulations includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
1335.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations its most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard areas.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zone A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.

flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on the Flood Boundary and Flood way Maps), and the water surface elevation of
the base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" means the base flood elevation plus
zero (0) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designed
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Registrar;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places
maintained by Reynoldsburg whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) - A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) - A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) - A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor"which is an unfinished or flood resistant usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "Manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park" means as specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes,
used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes,
and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Cityte of
Reynoldsburg's Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated September 1, 1978, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" means any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" (also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard") means-it-is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation of accessory buildings on the property, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a

structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. This term does not however include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure"; or
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction".
   (kk)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1335.99.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
(resolutions) including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance
(resolution), the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to
such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.10 INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all
provisions shall be:

law, such state law shall take precedence over these regulations.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations do not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07; Ord. 05-16. Passed 2-8-16.)
1335.12 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to begin construction or other
development activity including but not limited to filling; grading;
construction; alteration, remodeling, or expanding any structure; or alteration
of any watercourse wholly within, partially within or in contact with any
identified special flood hazard area, as established in Section
1335.07, until a floodplain development permit is obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator. Such floodplain development permit shall show that the proposed
development activity is in conformity with the provisions of these regulations.
No such permit shall be issued by the Floodplain Administrator until the
requirements of these regulations have been met.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.13 EXEMPTION FROM FILING A DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   An application for a development permit shall not be required for:

(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.16 APPEAL AND VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Appeals Board. City Council of the City of Reynoldsburg shall hear all
requests for variances and appeals, and in such capacity shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Appeals Board". All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be
open to the public except that the Appeals Board may deliberate in executive
sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with law. The Appeals
Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member
upon each question and shall keep records of all official actions. Records of
the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the office of the Clerk of
Council.
   (b)    Powers and Duties
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1335.16(d) of these regulations.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal
such decision to the Franklin County, Fairfield County, or Licking Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board, or their
designated representative.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties of interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board, or their designated representative.
         B.    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the fee schedule adopted by the City.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws;
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
         C.   Other Conditions for Variances.
            1.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
            2.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1335.16(d)(3)A.1. through 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
            3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
         D.   Procedure at Hearings.
            1.   All testimony shall be given under oath;
            2.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Appeals Board, but including all documents
presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses;
            3.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance;
            4.   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance;
            5.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel;
            6.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall
become part of the record for appeal;
            7.   The Appeals Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request
for the attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of
issuance and service shall be collected in advance; and
            8.   The Appeals Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting
its decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing
and thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing
within a reasonable time after the hearing.

1335.17 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that Reynoldsburg's flood
maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1335.07 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1335.28(c).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1335.17(a), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1335.17(a)(1).
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Reynoldsburg, and may
be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the City of Reynoldsburg’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits of the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07; Ord. 05-16. Passed 2-8-16.)
1335.18 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1335.16, Appeals and Variances Procedures.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.19 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.20 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1335.17(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Reynoldsburg and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1335.20(a)(2), items A. and C. - E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Reynoldsburg specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1335.17(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.21 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall give notice of such
violation to the person responsible therefore and order compliance with these
regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and order shall:
   (a)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
   (b)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections of
these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which, if
taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
   (c)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
   (d)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
   (e)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.22 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 32-07. Passed 5-14-07)
1335.23 APPLICATION REQUIRED.
   An application for a floodplain development permit shall be required for all
development activities located wholly within, partially within, or in contact
with an identified special flood hazard area. Such application shall be made by
the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent, herein referred to as
the applicant, prior to the actual commencement of such construction on a form

1335.28(c)(4).
   (d)   Residential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Where a structure, including its foundation members, is elevated on fill to or
above the base flood elevation, the requirements for anchoring (this paragraph)
and construction materials resistant to flood damage (Section
1335.28(d)(2)) are satisfied.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with methods and materials resistant to flood damage.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or elevated so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the flood protection elevation. In Zone A areas

1363.01 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, "swimming pool" means a body of water of
artificial construction, used for swimming or recreational bathing, which is
over eighteen inches in depth at any point and has more than 100 square feet of
area on the water surface when filled to capacity, and includes the sides and
bottom of such pool and the equipment and appurtenances thereof.
(Ord. 87-81. Passed 10-26-81.)
1363.02 LOCATION, AREA AND HEIGHT.
   (a)   No swimming pool, or part thereof, shall be located closer than ten
feet to the side or rear line of the lot or parcel upon which it is situated,
or closer to any street on which such lot or parcel abuts than a distance of
ten feet greater than the building setback line as fixed by the Zoning Code.
The area of the pool proper, exclusive of decks, walks and other appurtenances,
shall not exceed ten percent of the area of the lot or parcel on which it is
situated.
   (b)   The top of the walls, decks or walks of any swimming pool shall not
extend more than twenty feet beyond the pool proper in each direction, except
that where any side of the pool is less than twenty feet from any lot line, the
difference between such distance and twenty feet shall be added to the required
distance of the portion beyond the opposite side of the pool. In the event
that, because of the unusual shape or grade of the lot, or the location or
shape of the pool, the foregoing formula cannot be applied with reasonable
results, the Building Official shall be empowered to fix the location of the
pool site to be used in determining the maximum grade of the pool, in keeping
with the results sought to be achieved by the formula. In the event of
dissatisfaction by any interested party with the determination of the Building
Official, an appeal may be taken to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals.
   (c)   No lights, diving boards or other accessories shall project more than
ten feet above the average grade of the pool site as determined under the
provisions of this section.

   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Section 1363.03 was repealed as part of the 2007 revision of
these Codified Ordinances as directed by Ord. 90-06, passed 12-18-06)
1363.04 LIGHTS.
   All lights used for illuminating a swimming pool or the surrounding areas
shall be so designed, located and installed as to confine the direct beams
thereof to the lot or parcel on which the pool is located, and so as not to
constitute a nuisance or undue annoyance to occupants of abutting property.
(Ord. 32-67. Passed 5-22-67.)
1363.05 DRAINAGE.
   Provision shall be made for drainage of a swimming pool into a public storm
sewer where possible, or a sanitary sewer, unless there is a ditch or natural

protect and preserve our neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack
of adequate maintenance and security concerns at vacant structures. The City of

decline, create public nuisances, contribute to lower property values, and
discourage potential buyers from purchasing a home or business in neighborhoods
with vacant properties.

1701.08 ABATEMENT OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE BY THE BOARD OF NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Upon failure of the property owner to abate a nuisance:
      (1)   Upon the expiration time of the special permit;
      (2)   If no special building permit was issued within forty-five (45)
days of completion of service of the written order of the Board of Nuisance
Abatement; or
      (3)   Within fourteen (14) days of the expiration of the right to appeal
by the owner pursuant to Section

   The Director of Public Service is hereby authorized to cause entry upon such
premises, and the owner shall permit such entry, to abate the nuisance by
demolition and removal of the structure, or by boarding all windows, exterior
doors and other openings to secure the structure and by removal of litter and
cutting of rank growth that may be present.
   (b)   In abating such nuisances the Director shall obtain the abatement
thereof as provided by the Charter and Codified Ordinances relating to
construction, and the cost of such contract shall be paid for from City funds
except that in the case of boarding to abate the nuisance as provided for in
this section, the City may elect to do so by using its own employees and
materials the costs of such abatement shall be recovered from the owner in the
following manner:
      (1)   The owner shall be billed for the cost of the abatement by mailing
such bill to the owner by certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or
by personally serving the owner with a copy of such bill. If service of such
bill is not perfected by either of the hereinbefore described methods, then the
billing notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City and a newspaper of general circulation in the county for two (2)
consecutive weeks.
      (2)   If the owner fails to pay for the cost of such abatement within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill, or after the publication of the
second notice in the aforesaid newspaper, the Director shall cause the cost of
the abatement to be either certified to the County Treasurer and levied as a

CHAPTER 1703
Abandoned or Inoperable Gasoline Stations
1703.01   Abandoned gasoline stations as nuisance; definition.
1703.02   Abatement of nuisance.
1703.03   Inoperative gasoline stations.
1703.99   Penalty.
1703.01 ABANDONED GASOLINE STATIONS AS NUISANCE; DEFINITION.
   (a)   Whenever any gasoline station becomes abandoned, such station shall be
presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
property or general welfare of the community and shall be abated.
   (b)   "Abandoned" for the purpose of this chapter, means failure to operate
any gasoline service station for at least three (3) consecutive months.
(Ord. 21-16. Passed 3-28-16.)
1703.02 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE.
   (a)   Whenever the Building Official finds any gasoline service station to
be abandoned, they shall give notice in the same manner as the service of
summons in civil cases, or by certified U.S. mail addressed to the owner of
record of the premises at their last known address or to the address where tax
bills are sent, or by any combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such
abandoned condition within sixty (60) days either by:
      (1)   Placing such service station in operation in accordance with the
provisions of the City's ordinances;
      (2)   Adapting and using the building for another business use permitted
under the Zoning Code, provided the service station pumps and signs are
removed; or
      (3)   Razing the service station structure and removing the pumps and
signs. Underground service station storage tanks shall either be abandoned in
place or removed at the option of the Building Official and Fire Chief who
shall make the determination based upon the proposed use of the site and
whether the tanks can be properly safeguarded and conditioned if abandoned in
place. The abandonment in place or removal of underground tanks shall be
performed in accordance with accepted safe practice as prescribed in Appendix C
to the National Fire Protection Association Pamphlet No. 30 and under the
supervision of the Bureau of Fire Prevention of the City. As a condition
precedent to the abandonment of storage tanks in place, the City shall require
that the current or subsequent owners of the premises post insurance in an
amount the Fire Chief and Building Official believe necessary to protect
against injury or damage. It shall be the duty of the current owner to apprise
any potential successor in title of the fact that underground storage tanks are
abandoned in place and that the City shall at all times require insurance to be
maintained by the owner. Failure to notify the next successor in title shall be
a misdemeanor punishable as provided by Section 1703.99 and will not relieve
any innocent successor in title, who obtains title without knowledge of the
abandoned tanks, from the requirement that insurance be maintained. In no event
shall any structure be erected above any abandoned underground tank. If tanks
are removed, the Building Official shall supervise the necessary filling and
grading of the area.
   (b)   However, if the station is in operation at the time notice is given
and remains in operation for ninety (90) consecutive days thereafter, the
provisions of this section shall not apply. If a national emergency is declared
which would curtail the operation of motor vehicles or if Council should
determine that there exists a state of general economic depression, the
provisions of this section shall not apply.
   (c)   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the
notice to abate such abandonment, the Building Official shall take such action
as may be necessary to abate such nuisance in accordance with the provisions of
Section
1701.07.
(Ord. 21-16. Passed 3-28-16.)
1703.03 INOPERATIVE GASOLINE STATIONS.
   Inoperative gasoline stations, which do not come within the definition of
"abandoned" as defined herein, shall be maintained in accordance with the
provisions of the City's ordinances and the owner shall cut all grass and
remove all rubbish and weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles
upon the premises shall be prohibited and the owner shall place a sign of at
least ten (10) square feet in area in the window of such service station
notifying the public of this fact. If the Building Official finds that such
notice is not complied with by the public, he may order the owner of the
premises on which any station is inoperative for more than six (6) months to
install fencing or barricades approved by the Building Official which will be
sufficient to block motor vehicle access to such property.
(Ord. 21-16. Passed 3-28-16.)
1703.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
