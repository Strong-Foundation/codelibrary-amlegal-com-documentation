Village of Swanton for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

            3.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (D)(1)(b)1. above,

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in the Village of Swanton or
if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Village. The Village of Swanton shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
         (f)   1.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village of
Swanton, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or
broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
            2.   An individual who is a resident of the Village of Swanton
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Village of Swanton. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Village's income tax ordinance.
         (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (D)(1)(a)
above for the purposes of that division or division (D)(1)(b) above, the owner
of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (2)   (a)   As used in this division:
            1.   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER. An individual who is an
employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
               a.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
               b.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
            2.   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION. A permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
            3.   REPORTING LOCATION. Either of the following:
               a.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as
an office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that
is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
               b.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under §
35.04, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
            4.   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION. One of the following:
               a.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee
or owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis
during the taxable year;
               b.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (D)(2)(a)4.a. above, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
               c.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (D)(2)(a)4.a. or (D)(2)(a)4.b. above, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
         (b)   1.   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a
taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this division to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of division (D)(1) above apply to such
apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division.
            2.   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division
in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a
timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an
assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
            3.   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax
Administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            4.   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            5.   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a
new election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
         (c)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(D)(1)(a) above, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (D)(2)(b) above:
            1.   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(a)1. above, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
            2.   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(a)2. above, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
            3.   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(a)3. above, and
notwithstanding division (D)(1)(d) above, any gross receipts of the business or
profession from services performed during the taxable period by a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (d)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or
a Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all
or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
as described in division (D)(1)(b) above. However, a Tax Administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
         (e)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §
35.04.

§ 35.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Withholding provisions.
      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Village of Swanton shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except
for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
34.03 or division (A)(2)(d) or (A)(2)(f) below, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in §
34.03 of this chapter, of 1.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) below, an employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of
the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income
taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   a.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be
remitted monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of the Village of Swanton in the preceding calendar year
exceeded $2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of
the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
               b.   Payment under division (A)(2)(a)1.a. above shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (A)(2)(a)1.a. above of taxes required
to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under § 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. § 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Swanton. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Swanton as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the Village of Swanton income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
         (e)   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Swanton the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the Village of Swanton income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Swanton until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village of Swanton during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
            4.   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Swanton income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
         (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

fixed location or worksite location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the location
in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a

            2.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. below among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            3.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an

below, an employer is not required to withhold the Village of Swanton income
tax on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village
on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) above, an employee shall
be considered to have spent a day performing services in the Village of Swanton
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (B)(2)(a) above shall apply only
if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that division,
the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) below, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in the Village of Swanton exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Swanton for any subsequent days
in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village of

Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village of Swanton.
      (5)   (a)   If an employer's fixed location is in the Village of Swanton
and the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
35.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the

not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under §

other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.

Swanton income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written

federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to

individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is

Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village of Swanton to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under this
division (F) apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the Village of Swanton's income tax return for a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month
after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An
extension of time to file under this division is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that
date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village of Swanton's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Swanton, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file

municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.

division (G)(2)(b) above.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) conflicts

      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village of Swanton
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) above shall file with Village an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) above.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under §
35.04(A)(2)(a)1. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Swanton by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in §

return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and of Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (M)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the Village's

support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village

The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred eighty-first
day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) above

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) above.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in

division (P)(2)(a) shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a member

any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) above in calculating the penalty or
interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) above applies

   (R)   Consolidated municipal income tax return. For the purpose of division
(S) through (Y) below, the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS. An affiliated group as defined in
§ 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group includes at

affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange carrier that
would otherwise be included in the group.

   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) below or a
taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) below. The election to discontinue filing a
consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) above is binding on
all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a municipal
income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Swanton income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Village of Swanton income tax return for a taxable year shall file
a consolidated Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village of Swanton income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
below, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
35.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income” wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's” for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
35.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Village of Swanton income tax return shall do
one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or
loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village of Swanton. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village of Swanton. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village of Swanton;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Swanton income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter
on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Swanton income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable
to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section
and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Swanton income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Swanton before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

§ 35.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village of Swanton who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject
to division (C) below, the credit shall not exceed 50% of the amount obtained
by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other
compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the lower of the tax
rate in such other municipality or the tax rate of 1%.
   (B)   The Village of Swanton shall grant a credit against its tax on income
to a resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) above, "the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to tax in the
other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the tax
withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Swanton from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment
date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were
actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates
on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months

      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
35.05(G) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Swanton, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
35.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) above shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by
this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the
following apply:

the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the Village of Swanton
under §
35.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of Swanton
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

§ 35.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
35.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) below, the Tax Administrator shall issue an
assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially
denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
35.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) above shall be considered to have been filed in a
timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
35.18(A)(4).

§ 35.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.

should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Swanton is subject to recovery by
Village. If the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period

tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (C)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.

§ 35.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village of Swanton changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the
Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
35.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) below for
filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period prescribed in
that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division. If
the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be paid by the
Village of Swanton. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
35.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village of Swanton income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than $10.

§ 35.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) above may be
extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of
the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (C) below.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
35.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
35.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Swanton does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
35.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §
35.09(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover the Village of Swanton income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

§ 35.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   (1)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer
is entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a
form by which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      (3)   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

§ 35.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the
time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) below, a copy of each assessment shall be
served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) above is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
      (2)   (a)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         (b)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         (c)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) above. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
under this division in accordance with division (D) below.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) above bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) above, and if that assessment is subject to collection and
is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60 days after the
initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax
Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the person
if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local Board of Tax
Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) above, including those on which a claim has been delivered
for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this
section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the rules and regulations shall
apply.

§ 35.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the Village of Swanton that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed
in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

§ 35.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Swanton as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the
Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Village of Swanton from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.

claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise

§ 35.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Authority. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
Tax Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless
the performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision
of the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with §
35.03;
      (7)   (a)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
35.04.
   (B)   Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
      (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village of Swanton or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (C)   Identification information.
      (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

(Ord. 2010-4, passed 1-23-2010)
§ 36.08 ADJUSTMENTS TO UTILITY BILL POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Policy and purpose. It is the policy of the village to make
adjustments to customer utility bills where said adjustment is necessary to
correct billing errors, to correct errors due to equipment failure, or to
fairly apply the rates and rules of the utility. The purpose of this policy is
to improve customer service by enabling staff to quickly and accurately respond
to customer requests for adjustments to utility bills rather than waiting for
the matter to come before the Village Council and also setting forth the
situations where adjustments will and will not be considered.
   (B)   Responsibility. The Village Administrator, or designee, shall
determine the amount, if any, of the adjustment to be made. The Village
Administrator, or designee, shall receive requests and notify the customer of
the determination.
   (C)   Adjustments allowed. Staff is authorized to make adjustments to
utility bills, without Village Council action in the following cases:
      (1)   Billing errors. Where an error has occurred that results in an
inaccurate utility bill being sent to a customer, staff shall correct the error
as soon as discovered, whether by the customer or by staff. These adjustments
include data recording and entry errors as well as meter failures if tested and
found to be inaccurate.
      (2)   Late fees. Where a customer incurs late fees and requests an
adjustment, staff may reduce or remove the late fee based on the customer’s
circumstances and payment history.
      (3)   Sanitary sewer. Where a customer experiences extraordinary water
consumption during a billing period due to break in customer owned plumbing,
equipment malfunction, and the like and said water did not enter the sanitary
sewer system, staff may adjust the sanitary sewer charge to an amount that is
more typical of that customer’s normal usage. When an adjustment is made, a
credit for the amount of the adjustment, including any sales tax shall be made
to the customer’s account. When a customer makes a written request for an
adjustment, the amount under consideration for adjustment shall not be payable
until a determination on the adjustment is made. All other amounts not in
dispute shall be due according to utility rules. When a customer pays an amount
that is later adjusted, the credit shall remain on the account. No cash refunds
shall be made for adjustments unless the account has been or is subsequently
closed and a credit balance remains.
      (4)   Disconnection fees. When it becomes necessary for the village to
discontinue service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, there will be a
disconnection fee charge to the account and an adjustment will be made
accordingly.
      (5)   Delinquent accounts. When it becomes necessary for the village to
turn over the delinquent account to collections, an adjustment will be made
accordingly.
   (D)   Adjustments not allowed. The village will not consider adjustments for
the following situations:
      (1)   Water. Adjustments to water charges where customer experiences
extraordinary water consumption during a billing period due to a break in
customer-owned plumbing, equipment malfunction and the like.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer. Adjustments to sanitary sewer charges for customers
who claim normal outdoor water usage (such as, lawn or garden sprinkling, car
washing and the like) where the water used did not enter the sanitary sewer
system.
   (E)   Requests for adjustments. The request must be in writing. Written
requests shall state the name of the account holder, service address, contact
information and the reason for the requested adjustment. The customer shall
provide all information requested by the village and deemed necessary to make a
determination on the request.
   (F)   Response. The utility shall respond to the written request for
adjustment within ten business days after receiving from the customer all the
information necessary to make a determination on the request.
   (G)   Reporting. Village staff shall provide a quarterly report to the
Village Council on adjustments made under this policy exceeding $100.
   (H)   Appeals. Customers who disagree with the determination of staff
regarding their requested adjustments may appeal to the Village Council. Said
appeal must be in writing and shall be scheduled to be heard at the meeting
immediately after receipt of the written appeal.

§ 37.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   In an effort to spur revitalization of the village’s industrial base,
the village has designated an Enterprise Zone pursuant to state law. An
ENTERPRISE ZONE is an area within which special tax incentives will be offered
by agreement to industry who agree to invest in capital improvements and create
and/or retain jobs. Tax incentives will be offered, provided the guidelines are
met and a substantial investment is made. Jobs must be either created or
retained.
   (B)   Each agreement with a business within the Zone relating to jobs,
investments and tax incentives must be submitted to the village for its
approval and ultimately to the Fulton County Commissioners for their approval.
(Ord. 93-8, passed 8-23-1993)
§ 37.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Enterprise Zone is to encourage as much investment and
job creation as possible within the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone.
Retaining jobs is also a priority. Each agreement negotiated with an industry
shall be designed to spur capital investment while creating and/or retaining
jobs. In return, the village will agree to provide only the amount of tax
incentives necessary for each transaction.

by the village, contingent on approval by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency. If I&I credits are not available, the development will be placed on a
standby list until I&I credits become available. Developments will be placed on
the standby list in the order in which the sanitary sewer plans for each
development were approved by the village and developments will be allocated I&I
credits as they become available in the same order.
      (2)   I&I credits which are not used within one year after the same are
reserved will be subject to the following: all or part of the credits which
remain unused shall revert to the village upon request of the Village
Administrator and upon the approval of the Village Council in the event other
requests have been made for the same credits and the developer or person
reserving said credits has not provided adequate assurances that the sanitary
sewers will be completed within six months; or upon insolvency, bankruptcy or
termination of the development or project; or in the event the Ohio EPA
modifies its rules and regulations relative to the use of such credits. The
developer or property owner shall sign any and all documents required to return
such credits to the village.

   For grease, oil and inorganic material such as sand, grit and the like,
interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the Village
Administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in §
51.028, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable
covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Village
Administrator, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintenance of these interceptors the owner
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Village Administrator. Any removal
and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner personnel
must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.

§ 51.021 GROUND GARBAGE.
   (A)   This disposal of unground garbage to the sewer system is prohibited.
To prevent the disposal of solid industrial wastes and large quantities of
solid organic materials as ground garbage, garbage grinder installations are
restricted to locations where food is prepared for consumption on the premises.
   (B)   Four requirements for “properly ground garbage” are that only food
wastes be considered a garbage; that all ground particles be of such size that
they will be carried freely under the normal flow conditions prevailing in the
sewer conduit to which they are contributory; that installation of a garbage
grinder with a three-fourths horsepower (or greater) motor be subject to
approval of the Village Administrator or his or her authorized representative;
and that limitation on acceptable garbage grinder operation specify that no
more than 30%, on the dry basis, pass a No. 40 U.S. Standard sieve.

§ 51.025 PROHIBITION ON UNPOLLUTED WATER.
   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted storm
water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, cooling
water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any
existing roof drain connections to sanitary sewers or combined sewers shall be
connected into available storm sewer or shall be disconnected above ground in
the manner approved by the Village Administrator.

51.999
§ 51.027 STORM AND SURFACE WATERS.
   All surface runoff from areas expected to yield good quality water such as
roofs, paved areas, lawns and discharge from ground water collection systems
must be excluded from separate sanitary sewers. Runoff from certain uncovered
areas of an industrial plant during the initial period of rainfall is likely at
times to contain appreciable concentrations of materials. Such areas as rail
car or truck unloading stations, tank farms or unhoused process equipment may
be expected to receive material from leaks, spills, drips, tank washouts, tank
overflows, hose drainages and clean-outs. Limited and isolated areas can be
drained to the sanitary sewers so that both the wet and dry weather flows
receive treatment. If such an area is too extensive to permit admittance to the
sanitary sewer of the quantity of rainfall runoff involved, a system for
admitting the first flush of runoff to the sanitary sewer and automatic
division of additional runoff to the storm sewer shall be installed. The
diversion should be made after 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) of rainfall. An
alternative to the direct diversion of wastewaters from these areas is the use
of approved holding facilities with controlled discharge. Basements shall be
drained to the sanitary sewer because the wastewaters from washing machines,
portable laundry tubs and shower baths can cause gross pollution of storm sewer
outlets. Foundation drains are required to be discharged to a storm sewer.
Unpolluted water from air-conditioning systems, industrial cooling operation,
swimming pools and so forth shall be discharged to the storm sewers or directly
to natural drainage outlets.

§ 51.028 SUBSTANCES LIMITED.
   (A)   The following described substances, materials, waters or wastes shall
be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentration or quantities
which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or
equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not
otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance. The
Village Administrator may set limitations lower than the limitations
established in the regulations below if in his or her opinion more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate dilution
with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the regulations
below shall not be acceptable. In forming his or her opinion as to the
acceptability, the Village Administrator will give consideration to such facts
as the quantity of such waste in relation to flows and velocities in the
sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors.
   (B)   The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of
waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be
violated without approval of the Village Administrator are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150°F;

      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders
may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in the kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers;
      (4)   (a)   Any waters or wastes containing solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance or create any hazard to humans
or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving
waters of the wastewater treatment plant including, but not limited to,
cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and phenols in the
wastes as discharged to the public sewer. The following concentrations shall
not be exceeded in industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers:
Cadmium             0.2 mg/l
Copper              1.0 mg/l
Hexavalent chromium 1.0 mg/l
Hydrogen sulfide    10 mg/l
Lead                0.5 mg/l

         (b)   These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the
Village Administrator or state regulatory agencies based on new information
concerning inhibitory substances or to protect treatment plant processes.
Industrial dischargers covered by federal pretreatment requirements shall meet
those limitations specified under effluent guidelines published under §§ 304(b)
and 307(b) of the Federal Act, being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1314(b) and 1317(b) or the
above concentrations, whichever is more stringent. Major contributing
industries discharging incompatible pollutants into the public sewers shall be
regulated as provided in §
51.017.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Village Administrator or any local or
state regulatory agencies;
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable state or
federal regulations;
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute “slug”
as defined in §
51.001;
      (8)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters; and
      (9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with water or wastes in
the public sewer system, release noxious gases, from suspended solids which
interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes.

feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers and the
like, either whole or ground by garbage grinders. Direct discharge of such
materials as tar, asphalt, paint and waxes shall also be prohibited because
they may adhere to sewers and thus reduce the effective size of the pipe;
   (D)   Any garbage which has not been properly shredded as described in
detail in §
51.021; and
   (E)   Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a

CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
§ 51.045 ANALYSES.
   (A)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association.
Sampling methods, locations, times, durations and frequencies are to be
determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Village
Administrator or his or her duly authorized representative.
    (B)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the user responsible for the discharge, or his or her
qualified agent as approved by the Village Administrator. The results of the
analyses, shall be reported to the village on a monthly basis on forms provided
by the village. The village makes its own analyses on the wastes and these
determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances in division (C) below.
   (C)   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the village result
in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the village collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the village and the
industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlines in the
latest edition of Standard Methods and the differences negotiated.
   (D)   All costs incident to sampling and analyses shall be borne by each
user requiring such testing and analysis. Such costs incurred by the village
shall be billed annually to each such user, based upon actual cost to the
village, plus reasonable overhead. Such billing shall be billed with, and be
considered a part of, the sanitary sewer charge for the month billed.

§ 51.046 CONTROL MANHOLES.
   Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his or her wastes,
including sanitary wastewater. Control manholes or access facilities shall be
located and built in a manner acceptable to the Village Administrator. Where
required, measuring devices are to be permanently installed in the control
manhole, and shall be of a type acceptable to the Village Administrator.
Control manholes, access facilities and related equipment shall be installed by
the person discharging the waste at his or her expense and shall be maintained
by him or her so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating
condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities shall be
approved by the Village Administrator prior to the beginning of construction.

§ 51.047 EXTENSION OF TIME.
   (A)   When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would
create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule
imposed by §
51.054, a request for extension of time may be presented for consideration of
the Village Administrator. All requests for extension of time shall be
submitted in writing, stating the reasons for such a request.
   (B)   Under no circumstances shall the extension of time exceed 60 days
after approval of the extension by the Village Administrator.

§ 51.048 FLOW MEASUREMENT, SAMPLING AND MONITORING.
   The use of a water level recorder should be used for head measurements.
Consideration should be given to the fact that wastewater flow is subject to
variation depending on season, day of the week and plant production levels.
Collection of samples of wastewater for laboratory analysis requires extreme
care to obtain a representative sample. A series of samples must be collected
and composited in proportion to flow rates over a 24-hour period to obtain a
representative sample for laboratory analysis. Where a plant has more than one
sewer outlet, samples must be collected at each outlet and composited in
proportion to the flow rate at the outlet. The composite for the entire plant
is computed from these data. Flow is usually measured over a 24-hour period. To
measure slugs, readings at 15-minute intervals are necessary. A continuous
analyzer requires samples be taken every 15 minutes.

§ 51.049 INADMISSIBLE WASTES.
   Certain waste products shall be completely excluded from the sewers. These
waste products fall into five categories:
   (A)   Wastes that create a fire or explosive hazard in the sewers or
wastewater facility (§
51.029 (A));
   (B)   Waste products that will impair the hydraulics capacity of the sewer
system (§
51.029(B), (C) and (D)); and
   (C)   Wastes that, in any quantity, create a hazard to people, the sewer
system, the treatment process or the receiving waters (§

   (A)   Charges for wastes treatment pursuant to §§
51.155 through
51.167 shall apply to wastes not exceeding normal concentrations as follows:
      (1)   BOD: 200 milligrams per liter; and
      (2)   Suspended solids: 240 milligrams per liter.
   (B)   Applicable concentrations shall be based upon average concentrations,
weighted in proportion to volume of flow, determined during each monthly
billing period by the most practicable method possible. Should the average
concentration of any constituent exceed the normal concentration provided in
division (A) above, a surcharge for each constituent so exceeded shall apply
for the applicable monthly billing period, in accordance with the provisions of
§§
51.155 through
51.167.

§ 51.051 OIL AND GREASE.
   If oils and grease are biodegradable and in a physical state that does not
cause clogging or undue maintenance problems in the wastewater facilities, the
discharge of these substances can be accepted in a wastewater treatment system.
Animal and vegetable oils and greases (polar substances) are readily degradable
in aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems provided that the
physical states of the oils and grease do not prevent the necessary contact
with the biological suspensions responsible for treatment. However oils and
grease of mineral origin (primarily non-polar substances) are essentially non-
biodegradable either in aerobic or anaerobic processes and should be removed
from industrial wastes to the maximum degree practical before discharge. The
discharge of these oils and greases of mineral origin shall be limited to the
regulation of the village. Grease separators are required for all meat packing
plants and on building sewers serving hotels, restaurants and institutions in
which large numbers of meals are served. However, the use of garbage grinders
precludes the use of gravity grease separators. Flammable waste and grit
intercepting facilities must be provided on all building sewers from garages,
filling stations, cleaning establishments and other concerns using volatile
oils or solvents. Special pretreatment methods are required for the removal of
soluble cutting oils. All grease and oil removal facilities must be approved by
the Village Administrator.

§ 51.052 POLLUTANTS IN EXCESS OF NORMAL CONCENTRATIONS.
   (A)   Wastewater containing pollutants in excess of normal concentrations as
defined in §
51.050 shall be:
      (1)   Subject to prohibition of discharge to the wastewater treatment
works;
      (2)   Subject to pretreatment prior to discharge to the wastewater
treatment works to comply with concentrations or amounts of pollutants
established by the village and subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to §§
51.155 through
51.167; or
      (3)   Permitted to be discharged to the wastewater treatment works
without pretreatment, subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to §§
51.155 through
51.167.
   (B)   The Village Administrator shall determine which of the three
alternates shall apply, based upon the volume and concentration of pollutants
of the wastewaters involved.

§ 51.053 SEGREGATION OF CLEAN AND POLLUTED WATER.
   Wastewaters discharged from industrial and commercial establishments include
process wastewaters containing organic or inorganic solids and cooling or
condensing waters containing no added organic matter or reducing gases. Waters
of the latter class, incapable of causing objectionable conditions in an open
watercourse, shall be segregated from polluted wastes and discharged to storm
sewers or to a natural outlet. Rainfall runoff shall not always be considered
clean water but shall be routed according to its quality as per §
51.027. Even though unpolluted wastes do not increase the organic load on
wastewater treatment units, the added volume increases pumping costs and
reduces detention periods of settling tanks, and aeration units.

§ 51.054 SUBMISSION OF BASIC DATA.
   Within 90 days after passage of this chapter, each person whose operation
entails the discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and
file with the Village Administrator, a written statement setting forth the
nature of the operation contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and
source of waste required for use, the proposed point of discharge of said
wastes into the wastewater collection system of the village, the estimated
amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth the expected
bacterial, physical, chemical and other known characteristics of said wastes.
Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of
the Village Administrator to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as
in the judgment of the Village Administrator may be necessary to adequately
guard against unlawful uses of the village’s wastewater system.

§ 51.055 TEMPERATURE CONTROL.
   The direct discharge of storm and boiler blow-offs is prohibited along with
the discharge of any wastewater at a temperature above 150°F (65°C). In areas
where hydrogen sulfide production is of unusual significance in wastewater,
this limit may be too high, and a lower limit shall be set at the discretion of
the Village Administrator.

   The discharge of water containing dangerous levels of toxic materials
including those listed below, is limited to the regulation of the Village
Administrator:
   (A)   Substances having toxic effects, fire and explosive hazards, or
corrosive properties;
   (B)   Substances having a cumulative toxic effect in the food chain;
   (C)   Substances that are refractory to biological degradation;
   (D)   Heavy metals such as copper, zinc and nickel which are additive in
their effect of inhibition of the activated sludge process. The restriction
shall be based on a summation of the concentration of these metals, each
modified by a relative toxicity factor; and
   (E)   Mineral acids and alkaline metals that affect the concentration of
hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions in the wastewater. The pH of the wastewater
should be between 6.0 and 9.0.

   (A)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption of the user as shown in the records of
water meter readings maintained by the village except as herein provided in
this section.
   (B)   If the user discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers

   (A)   In addition to the applicable base user charges and debt service
charges pursuant to §§
51.157 and
51.158, and in addition to any applicable surcharge for wastes in excess of
normal pursuant to §
51.159, all users in the industrial user class shall be levied an industrial
cost recovery (ICR) surcharge in order that their proportionate share of the
federal grant for the wastewater treatment plant improvements (Federal Project
Number C 390957) will be recovered, provided, however, that pursuant to United
States Pub. L. No. 95-217, § 24B, being 33 U.S.C. § 204(b) industrial users
discharging the equivalent of 25,000 gallons a day or less, of any sanitary
waste, which does not contain any pollutants that: interfere with the treatment
processes, are incompatible, or contaminate or reduce the utility of the sludge
treatment works are exempted from the surcharges required herein. Upon
application in writing, the Superintendent shall make such determination. All
users in the nonindustrial user class shall be exempt from the surcharges
required in this section.
   (B)   The ICR surcharges shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for flow for each billing period during a calendar year
shall be based upon the design average flow for the wastewater treatment plant
(expressed in 1,000 gallons/day): design average flow equals 920,000 gallons/
day, (Qd = 920).
      (2)   (a)   The ICR surcharge per 1,000 gallons of water metered for each
industry subject to the grant recover surcharges equals:
(Grant Amount + 30)

§ 51.164 MEASUREMENT AND DETERMINATION OF WATER USED.
   The following methods shall be used to determine the sewage charges provided
by §
51.161 upon premises served by the system.
   (A)   On premises using water exclusively supplied by the municipal water
works and having a water meter acceptable to the village, the quantity of water
used, as measured by such meter, shall determine the sewer charge as provided
herein.
   (B)   On premises using water exclusively supplied from other sources than
the municipal waste works, where the quantity of water used is not measured by
a water meter or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the village,
the owner or other interested party may be required at his or her expense to
install and maintain an acceptable water meter. The quantity of water used, as
measured by such meter, shall determine the water quantity for the sewage
charge as provided herein, or such water quantity may be established by
negotiation between such owner or interested party and the village.
   (C)   On premises using water supplied both by the municipal water works and
from other sources not measured by a meter acceptable to the village, such
owner or other interested party may be required at his or her expense to
install and maintain an acceptable water meter to measure water from such other
sources. The quantity of water used as measured by such meter, plus such
measured quantity as supplied by the municipal water works, shall determine the
water quantity for the sewage charge as herein provided, or such water quantity
may be established by negotiation between such owner or interested party and
the village.
   (D)   In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the village, with
respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from any source used
thereon does not and cannot enter the system, then the owner or other
interested party may at his or her expense install and maintain separate water
meters where necessary to show only that portion of water used which is
discharged into the system. That quantity of water used as measured by such
meter showing discharge into the system shall determine the sewage charge
thereon at the rates provided herein. If the quantity of water being discharged
into the system is established by negotiation, such negotiated quantity at the
rate provided herein shall determine the sewage charge thereon. Swimming pools
and similar uses shall be negotiated and the volume of water used may be
established by the volume of the container and the volume of the water which
does not enter into the sewage system.

must be annexed to the village prior to extension of service, whether or not a
sewer line is accessible to their premises; or
         (b)   With approval of Village Council, if said property is contiguous
to the village, the property owner agrees to file for annexation of said
property at the property owner’s expense as soon as legally possible and pursue
all appeals relative to said annexation; and enter into an agreement with the
village which sets forth terms for extension of service. Said agreement shall
be recorded in the land records of the County Recorder. No connection to said
system shall be allowed until said annexation petition is filed. For this
provision to apply, a three-fourths affirmative vote of Council is necessary.
      (2)   If annexation is not legally possible, sewer service may be
extended upon the execution of an agreement between the village and the
property owner(s) that they will petition for annexation, at their expense, as
soon as legally possible. Such agreement will be recorded in the land records
of the County Recorder and bind the successors in interest to owners’ property.
      (3)   If a main sewer line exists accessible to owners’ property, the
village may charge, in addition to the tap-in fee and any extraordinary costs

reasonable amount of interest from the date the village paid for the project.
      (4)   If a main sewer line is not accessible to a property desiring sewer
service, the village may extend a main sewer line and allocate all costs of
same to the abutting property owners. If payment arrangements are not made
prior to installation of the main sewer line, no property owner shall be
permitted to access such main sewer line until his or her proportionate share
of the cost of the main line is paid, together with a reasonable amount of
interest from the date of payment by the village, and the requirements of
either division (A)(1) or (A)(2) above, are satisfied.
   (B)   For any extension to premises outside of the village limits not
already served, a two-thirds affirmative vote of Council is necessary prior to
extension of service.

§ 52.02 METHOD OF PAYMENT.
   (A)   Water meters will be read monthly with bills sent monthly. For those
months in which the meter is not read, the bill will be based on an estimate of
the water which will be used in the month. This estimate will be based on the
previous consumption, however this estimate may be modified by the Village
Administrator. Upon subsequent reading of the meter, the bill will be adjusted
to account for the difference between the estimated and the actual consumption.
Bills will be sent on the first of each month and will be due on the 15th of
the same month. A 10% late payment penalty will be assessed on the outstanding
balance of the current month. The due date and/or the late charge may be
modified by the Village Administrator in unusual or exceptional cases.
   (B)   Wherever more than one family unit or more than one business,
professional or commercial establishment are supplied by one meter, then the
water created shall be applied to each unit as though a separate water meter
supplied each unit. This section shall include, but not be limited to, mobile
home courts. The largest charge will be applied to each unit before the next
lowest rate is applied.

§ 52.03 DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   The village shall disconnect utility service in accord with the following
policies.
   (A)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment, service will be reinstated only after all
payments for utility service and the disconnection fee then due have been
received. It is the policy of the village to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The village's Establishment of
Utility Service Application and all bills shall contain, in addition to the
utility billing address, telephone number, email address, charge, past due
charge, and shut off date, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to
the effect:
      (1)   All bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on
the bill;
      (2)   Disconnection of service will take place on the 2nd of the month
following the due date of the bill if payment has not been received.
      (3)   Any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill shall
have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in person
and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may present
orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the village
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint.
   (B)   Requests of delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
   (C)   The village reserves the right to discontinue utility service to any
utility customer of the village who has not had an actual utility meter service
reading conducted by village personnel for six consecutive months. Thirty days
prior to any disconnection of utility service, village personnel shall attempt
to notify the utility customer by certified mail or personal service by posting
a notice on the entry door to the premises requesting access to their property
to obtain an actual utility service reading. If an actual reading is not
obtained within ten days after the attempted notification is made, utility
service will be discontinued until an actual reading can be obtained. Prior to
the restoration of service, the village will install a meter reader at the
property at no cost to the customer to facilitate more efficient meter reading
services.

the right to discontinue water service to such premises until such time as the
unpaid charges are paid in full.

   For residents within the village, a fee of $50 will be assessed to the
account once crews are dispatched from the utility billing office to disconnect
service. This fee will be increased to $75 if the disconnection is not
performed during normal working hours. For individuals who reside outside the
incorporated village, a fee of $75 will be charged whenever water service is
disconnected at the curb-box. This fee will be increased to $100 if the
disconnection is not performed during normal working hours. Normal working

larger than three-fourths inch or a service line exceeding one inch in diameter
is required, all additional material and installation costs shall be the sole
responsibility of the property owner.
   (C)   All new water service connections are required to be metered. The
property owner or applicant shall bear the full cost of the water meter and any
associated components, as determined by the village. Meter sizes and associated
charges are detailed in
Chapter 52, Appendix A, which may be updated by ordinance to reflect actual
procurement costs.
   (D)   When applicable, a temporary surcharge may be applied to account for
external market factors (e.g., tariffs). The final meter cost will reflect the
most current rate listed in
Chapter 52, Appendix A at the time of purchase or installation.

interest from the date of payment by the village, and the requirements of
either division (B)(1) or (B)(2) above, are satisfied.
   (C)   For any extension to premises outside of the village limits not
already served, a two-thirds affirmative vote of Council is necessary prior to
extension of service.
   (D)   Refer to §
52.05 for disconnection/reconnection fee information.

§ 54.08 ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   In the event the amount of impervious area on a non-residential
property is increased above that assigned by the Village Administrator, an
adjustment may be made to the ERU multiple assigned to the property to properly
reflect the amount of impervious area. The new ERU multiple shall be billed
from the date on which the village mails a notification of the change to the
owner of the property and shall not be stayed by an appeal under §
54.09. If the Village Administrator finds that the village has been under
billing a non-residential property as a result of the increase in an impervious
area, the owner may be charged for the difference between the amount actually
billed and the amount that should have been billed for a period of time not to
exceed one year prior to the date of the village’s mailing of a notification to
the owner that an adjustment is being made to the property’s ERU multiple.
   (B)   The owner of a non-residential property may apply for an adjustment to
the ERU multiple if the owner has taken certain actions that reduce the impact
of storm water runoff to the storm water system. The maximum adjustment that
may be made to the ERU multiple for any non-residential property is 30%
consisting of any one or more of the following credit options:
      (1)   Detention/retention ponds: 30%;
      (2)   Forested (stream) buffer/grass filter strip: 10%;
      (3)   Industrial NPDES: 10%;

assigned his or her property by filing an appeal with the Village Administrator
for adjustment thereof, stating in writing the grounds for the appeal. The
Administrator shall cause appropriate investigation thereof and report the
findings to the property owner. The Administrator shall consider the appeal and
determine whether an adjustment of the ERU multiple for any such lot or parcel
is necessary, and adjust such ERU multiple if appropriate.
   (B)   If the property owner is not satisfied with the finding, a public
hearing before the Village Council may be requested. Council shall make a
decision based on the evidence presented and the need to protect, preserve, and
improve the village’s storm water drainage system, equal treatment of like
properties, fairness to unique properties, and the health and welfare of
village residents. Council may affirm, modify or reverse any decision of the
Village Administrator. After consideration, the Village Council shall issue a
written decision to the property owner which shall be the final decision of the
village.

to review and process each permit, ensuring compliance with local regulations
and minimizing disruptions to the community.

application for a construction permit is denied, this fee shall not be
refunded. If the application is granted, then the applicant shall pay, within

the hourly rate established by the Village Administrator. Such actual costs
include, but are not limited to, costs of disruption and rerouting of traffic,
inspection costs and administrative costs.

permit holder shall pay, within 30 days of the presentation of a statement, any
extraordinary or unusual expenses reasonably incurred by the village as a
result of the permit holder's use of the rights-of-way, provided that the
village notifies the permit holder of the expected expenses prior to them being
incurred and provides the permit holder with an opportunity to mitigate such
expenses. Examples of extraordinary or unusual costs include, but are not
limited to, the cost of obtaining and operating a backhoe, dump truck or other
heavy equipment used to repair the right-of-way, overtime or special pay for
police officers or other emergency services. The statement of such expenses
presented to the permit holder shall be directly related to the village's
actual costs.

of any other monetary penalty. Acceptance of payment under this section shall
not in any way limit or waive the village's right to suspend or terminate the
permit according to the terms of this chapter.

§ 150.112 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of the Zoning Code and the intent of the legislative
authority in its adoption is to promote and protect to the fullest extent
permissible under state laws, the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity and the general welfare of the village; by regulating the use of
buildings, other structures and land for residences, public facilities,
business, services, industry or other purposes; by regulating and restricting
the bulk, height, design, percent of lot coverage and location of buildings; by
regulating and limiting population density; and, for the aforesaid purposes, to
divide the land within the corporation limits of the village into districts of
such number and dimension in accordance with the objectives of the Zoning Code;
and to provide procedures for the administration and amendment of said Zoning
Code.
   (B)   This Zoning Code is intended to achieve, among others, the following
objectives:
      (1)   To protect the character and values of residential, institutional
and public use, business, commercial and manufacturing uses; and to ensure
their orderly and beneficial development;
      (2)   To provide adequate open spaces for light, air and outdoor use;
      (3)   To prevent overcrowding of the land;
      (4)   To prevent excessive concentration of population; and, on the other
hand, to prevent sparse and uncoordinated development;
      (5)   To regulate and control the location and spacing of buildings on
the lot and in relation to the surrounding property so as to maintain the
public health and the village;
      (6)   To regulate the location of buildings and intensity of uses in
relation to streets according to plans so as to cause the least interference
with, and be damaged least by traffic movements, hence result in lessened
street congestion and improved safety;
      (7)   To establish zoning patterns that ensure economical extensions for
sewers, water supply, waste disposal and other public utilities as well as
development of recreation, schools and other public facilities; and
      (8)   To accomplish the specific intent and goals set forth in the
introduction to the respective sections.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.113 RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.
   (A)   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall supplement any and all laws
of the state, ordinances of the Village or any and all rules and regulations
promulgated by authority of such law or ordinance relating to the purpose and
scope of such Zoning Code.
   (B)   The provisions of the Zoning Code shall not annul or in any way
interfere with existing deed or plat restrictions, easements or other
agreements between persons, codes, laws, rules, regulations or permits
previously adopted or issued except those ordinances or sections thereof which
are contrary to and in conflict with this Zoning Code.
   (C)   Whenever this Zoning Code imposes greater restrictions upon the use of
buildings or land, the heights or bulk of buildings, or requires larger land or
building areas, yards or other open spaces than are otherwise required or
imposed by other deed or plat restrictions, codes, laws, ordinances, rules or
regulations, this Zoning Code shall control; and conversely, other regulations
shall control where they impose greater restrictions than this code. The
Village of Swanton cannot enforce deed or plat restrictions. Only property
owners can enforce such requirements.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.114 RULES OF INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Minimum Requirements. In interpreting and applying the provisions of

law relating to the use of structures and land and the design, erection,
alteration or maintenance of structure thereon.
   (B)   Conflicts or Inconsistency. Unless otherwise specifically stated
within this Zoning Code, and unless the context clearly indicates the contrary,

inconsistent with each other, then the most restrictive provision shall apply.

calculated to include weekdays, weekends, and holidays, unless stated

plural the singular.
      (4)   A “structure” includes a “building” and any part thereof unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.
      (5)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions, or events

reconstructed, moved or maintained, only for the principal and accessory uses
specifically enumerated in the district in which the building, structure or
parcel of land is located and for no other use, except as may otherwise be
specifically authorized in this Code.

hereby made a part of this zoning code as enacted on January 25, 1988 or
subsequently amended in the same manner as other parts of this zoning code.
   (B)   No changes of any nature shall be made to the Zoning Map or matter
shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Zoning
Code.
   (C)   Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Zoning Map,

be the Zoning Map located in the office of the Village Administrator, which
shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land, buildings
and other structures.
   (D)   In the event that the official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed
or lost, Village Council may, by ordinance, adopt a new Zoning Map which shall

§ 150.155 DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   (A)   The district boundary lines of the Zoning Map enclose an area of a
designated district, and generally follow recorded lot lines, the centerline of
streets, railroad rights-of-way or their extensions, provided, however:
      (1)   Where boundaries apparently follow lot lines and are not more than
ten feet therefrom, the lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;
      (2)   Where the district boundary line is shown by dimension or
relationship as being located a specific distance from and/or parallel to a
street line, said distance shall control;
      (3)   Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it
shall be determined by scale, and each part of the parcel shall comply with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; or
      (4)   Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
previously mentioned lines, and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed
points shown on the Zoning Map, it shall be determined by the scale appearing
thereon.
   (B)   Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street or public way is vacated
by official action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of the
street or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation and all area included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject to
all regulations of the extended districts.
   (C)   Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by any of
the above statements on District Boundaries, or if there is a dispute
concerning the exact location of zoning district boundaries, the Village
Planning Commission shall interpret the district boundaries.

§ 150.156 ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   All territory, which may hereafter be annexed to Swanton Village and is
already zoned, shall be continued in its existing zone classification until
amended in conformance with the amendment procedures outlined in this Zoning
Code and the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may make a zoning recommendation to Council
when land outside the village limits is to be annexed to the village. Zoned
areas that are proposed for annexation shall be compatible with or similar to
the zoning district located within the village.
   (B)   Land annexed to the village shall be in conformity with the village
zoning classifications and with the Comprehensive Plan.

§ 150.212 USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Use Schedule Summary. 
Schedule 150.212(D) below sets forth the uses allowed in residential districts.
The abbreviations used in the Schedule indicate the following:
      (1)   Uses Permitted By Right. A “P” in a cell indicates that the use is
allowed by-right as a principal use in the respective district.
      (2)   Conditional Uses. A “C” in a cell indicates that the use is
regulated as a conditional use. The use is permitted in the respective district
only after an applicant receives Conditional Use approval pursuant to
Article 150.67.
      (3)   Accessory Uses. An “A” in a cell indicates that the use is a
permitted accessory use, provided it is clearly incidental and subordinate to a
permitted principal or conditional use listed in
Schedule 150.212(D).
      (4)   Conditional Accessory Uses. A “CA” in a cell indicates that the use
is permitted only as an accessory use and only after an applicant receives
Conditional Use approval pursuant to

      (5)   Uses Not Permitted. The letters “NP” in a District column indicate
that the use is not allowed in that zoning district.
      (6)   Use-Specific Standard Cross-Reference. An “*” in a cell indicates
that a Use-Specific Standard cross-referenced in the right-hand column of the
Schedule applies to the use in that zoning district.
   (B)   Compliance with Standards. Although a use may be indicated as a
permitted use in a particular district, it shall not be approved on a lot
unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards
and other regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and lot in
question, including but not limited to any supplemental use-specific standards
cross-referenced in
Schedule 150.212(D).
   (C)   Organization of Use Table. In the Use Table, land uses are classified
into general use categories and specific uses based on common physical or
functional characteristics, such as type of dwelling unit, amount of activity
generated by the use, and site conditions. Whenever a standard or reference is
made to a general use category throughout this code, it shall include the
specific uses in that category.
   (D)   Schedule 150.212(D) Permitted Uses.

Schedules 150.214 and
150.215, or as modified in subsequent sections.
      (2)   Each lot shall abut upon a dedicated street for the required lot
width, except for one-family lots fronting on a cul-de-sac or curved street,
which shall comply with the lot frontage requirement as set forth in
Schedule 150.214.
      (3)   The width of a corner lot shall be sufficient to comply with the
side yard requirements. An alley shall not be considered a street for the
purposes of determining a corner lot.
   (C)   One Principal Building per Lot. There shall not be more than one
principal building constructed on a residential lot in an R-E, R-1, R-2, and R-
3 District.
   (D)   Minimum Front Setback.
      (1)   The minimum required front setback on a lot shall not be less than
the depth set forth in
Schedules 150.214 and
150.215 or as modified in subsequent sections.
      (2)   Where 50% or more of the aggregate street frontage between two
successive intersecting streets is occupied by buildings of the type and use
permitted in the district before the effective date of this zoning code, or any
amendments thereto, the minimum required front setback for new principal
buildings shall be the average setback of existing buildings located within 100
feet on either side of a given lot; provided, however, the depth of the front
yard resulting there from shall be not less than one-half of the minimum
dimension, specified in
Schedules 150.214 and
150.215.
   (E)   Minimum Side Setbacks.
      (1)   A side setback shall be provided for each side lot line on a one-
family dwelling lot. The width of each minimum required side setback shall not
be less than the dimension specified in
Schedule 150.214.
      (2)   Where an existing side setback does not comply with the required
side setback for the district in which the lot is located and which was owned
separately from all other tracts of land on the effective date of this zoning
code or any amendment thereto, and is still so owned, the principal building
may be maintained or altered but shall not be enlarged unless the total width
of the side setback complies with the regulations of this zoning code.
   (F)   Minimum Side Setback on Corner Lots. Where new construction or an
addition to an existing building is proposed for a corner lot, such building or
building addition shall maintain a corner side setback that complies with the
following:
      (1)   When the rear lot line of a corner lot coincides with the side lot
line of an interior lot, the corner side setback shall comply with the minimum
front setback requirements.
      (2)   When the rear lot line of a corner lot coincides with the rear lot
line of another corner lot, or is separated from such lot by an alley, the
corner side setback shall comply with the minimum side setback set forth in
Schedules 150.214 and
150.215 for the district in which it is located.
   (G)   Minimum Rear Setback. The rear setback of a lot for a one-family
dwelling shall not be less than the depth set forth in
Schedule 150.214 for the district in which it is located, or not less than 25%
of the depth of the lot, whichever is the lesser.
   (H)   Minimum Setback from Project Boundary. In the R-4 and R-5 Districts,
the setback of a dwelling from any project boundary shall be not less than the
distance set forth in
Schedule 150.215. The project boundary shall include all lot lines that divide
the development site from adjacent lots not included in the development and
shall be the boundaries of the minimum area set forth in
Schedule 150.215.
   (I)   Projections into Setbacks. A projection is that part or feature of a
building that extends beyond the enclosing walls of the dwelling. Certain
building features may project into the minimum required setback as noted below:
      (1)   Architectural features. A belt course, balcony, cornice, gutter,
chimney or similar architectural feature may project into the minimum front,
side or rear setback for a maximum distance of two (2) feet.
      (2)   Entrance features and unenclosed shelters. An entrance hood, or an
open platform, landing, steps, terrace or other feature not extending above the
first floor level of the principal building, or an open but roofed porch, patio
or deck, shall not extend more than six (6) feet into the minimum front setback
and three (3) feet into the minimum side setback. Unenclosed shelters are
roofed but unenclosed projections from the main wall of a building, which may
or may not use columns or other ground supports for structural purposes, and
which do not meet the definition of enclosed shelter in §
150.213(I)(3) below.
      (3)   Enclosed porches and other shelters. An enclosed entry, porch,
patio or other shelter that is covered by a roof attached to the dwelling, and
enclosed on two or more sides with walls, siding, windows or other material
including, but not limited to, screening shall be considered an integral part
of the principal building and shall meet the setback requirements for principal

§ 150.220 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   It is the intent of this section to eliminate as home occupations all uses
except those that conform to the standards set forth in this section. The
standards for home occupations in this section are intended to ensure
compatibility with other permitted uses and with the residential character of
the neighborhood, plus a clearly accessory status in relation to the
residential use of the principal building as the criteria for determining
whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a home occupation. Home
occupations are permitted accessory uses in residential zones only so long as
all the following conditions are observed. In the event the operation of a home
occupation violates any requirement in this Code, the home occupation may be
terminated by the Zoning Administrator.
   (A)   Such occupations shall be conducted solely by resident occupants in
their residence.
   (B)   No more than one room or 25% of the gross area of one floor of said
residence, whichever is less, shall be used for such purpose. Use of accessory
buildings for these purposes is prohibited.
   (C)   No use shall require internal or external alterations or involve
construction features or the use of electrical or mechanical equipment that
would change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in which the
structure is located.
   (D)   No home occupation will cause an increase in the use of any one or
more utilities (water, sewer, electricity, telephone, garbage and the like) so
that the combined total use for dwelling and home occupation purposes exceeds
the average for residences in the neighborhood.
   (E)   There shall be no outside storage of any kind.
   (F)   The use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more
than one additional vehicle at a time.
   (G)   No use shall create noise, dust, vibration, smoke, glare, electrical
interference, fire hazard or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater or
more frequent extent than that usually experienced in an average residential
occupancy in the district in question under normal circumstances wherein no
home occupation exists.
   (H)   Only one sign shall be allowed. Such sign shall not exceed one square
foot in area, shall be non- illuminated, and attached flat to the principal
structure or visible through a window. The limitation of one sign is intended
to apply to all lots, including corner lots.
   (I)   No home-based business/occupation shall require the daily services of
a commercial freight carrier which produces traffic in greater frequency or of
a different nature than normally found in the surrounding residential area.
Delivery services normally and customarily associated with a residential use
are permitted.
   (J)   No retail or wholesale transactions shall be made on the premises.

E, R-1, R-2, or R-3 District, an application for a Zoning Certificate for such
an accessory use shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. Unless otherwise
provided in this Code, a one-time fee, as established by the Village’s Fee
Schedule/Ordinance, which can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator, shall
be charged for such Zoning Certificate. Any change in the recreational vehicle
involved shall terminate the Certificate, and a new application must thereafter
be filed and processed.
   (C)   Only one recreational vehicle such as a motorhome, or one or more off-
road vehicle(s) stored on one trailer used to transport such vehicles, or one
storage or work trailer shall be parked or stored on a lot, accessory to a
permitted principal use.
   (D)   Such vehicle(s) shall be owned or leased by an occupant of the
premises, except for the temporary parking of a recreational vehicle owned by a
guest of the occupant.
   (E)   In addition to the locational requirements set forth in
Schedule 150.218(C), recreational vehicles, storage trailers and work trailers

§ 150.231 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Residential Development Overlay District (PRDO)
and associated regulations is to encourage and accommodate unique, well-
designed, unified residential developments through flexible site planning
concepts that are consistent with the Village’s planning policies and which
would not otherwise be achievable in a standard residential district pursuant
to this Zoning Code. More specifically, these PRDO regulations are intended to:
   (A)   Encourage site design practices that provide for efficient layout of
infrastructure and preserve open space and natural features, while maintaining
density control compatible with the base zoning district.
   (B)   Foster a variety of housing types and styles for village residents.
   (C)   Encourage development that minimizes roadway lengths to reduce
maintenance and snow plowing; clusters uses to minimize the length of water,
sewer and other utility lines; minimizes impervious surfaces and maximizes
natural stormwater detention and percolation.

§ 150.232 DESIGNATION OF PRD OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   An overlay district is a mapped zone that establishes a development option
with a set of design requirements that are in addition to those of the base
zoning district, so that any parcel of land lying in a PRD Overlay District

§ 150.233 SCOPE OF REGULATION.
   The provisions in this
Article 150.23 set forth the list of permitted uses and flexible site planning
requirements that govern the design and layout of a Planned Residential
Development and the terms and conditions governing the development review and
approval process.
   (A)   Relationship to Base District.
      (1)   In the PRD Overlay District, the use and dimensional specifications
of the base zoning district are herein replaced by an approval process in which
an approved plan becomes the basis for continuing land use controls.
      (2)   The base zoning district shall be used as a guide for development,
with any adjustment relative to use, density and building layout reviewed and
approved through the PRDO review process set forth in §
150.240.
      (3)   In the event a proposed PRD is located in more than one base zoning
district, the regulations of base zoning district with the highest density
shall be used as the guide for the entire project.
   (B)   The standards contained in this Article prevail whenever there is a
conflict or difference between the provisions of this Article and those of
other Articles and Sections in this Zoning Code.
   (C)   If a provision found elsewhere in this Zoning Code has not been
explicitly modified by this Article, the standard shall govern unless such
standard is waived by the Planning Commission and/or Council, as applicable
pursuant to §
150.241.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.234 MINIMUM DISTRICT AREA.
   (A)   A site of ten (10) contiguous acres or more with a minimum of 200 feet
of frontage shall be required for application of the PRD Overlay District,
unless specifically permitted otherwise.
   (B)   The Planning Commission and Village Council may approve a rezoning to
the PRD Overlay District for an area less than ten (10) acres when it finds
that:
      (1)   Ownership of adjacent land cannot be readily consolidated to reach
the ten (10) acre minimum, or restrictions on the abutting property prevent the
developer from reasonably acquiring the additional land necessary to satisfy
the minimum area required;
      (2)   The smaller land area has unique features that cannot be preserved
if the parcel is developed applying the standard requirements for a major
residential development;
      (3)   The proposed project will not have any unreasonable or adverse
impacts on adjacent areas; and
      (4)   The proposed project will yield a sufficient number of residents to
adequately fund and maintain all common areas, including private infrastructure
in the PRD.

§ 150.235 USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Use Schedule Summary. 
Schedule 150.235(C) sets forth the uses allowed in a PRD Overlay District. The
abbreviations used in the Schedule indicate the following:
      (1)   A “P” indicates that the use is allowed as a principal use.
      (2)   An “A” in a cell indicates that the use is a permitted accessory
use, provided it is clearly incidental and subordinate to a permitted principal
use listed in
Schedule 150.235(C).
      (3)   Use-Specific Standard Cross-Reference. An “*” in the “Allowed Use”
column indicates that a Use-Specific Standard cross-referenced in the right-
hand column of the Schedule applies to the use.
   (B)   Additional Uses. Additional uses may be authorized for a PRD as part
of the rezoning and preliminary plan approval, provided the Planning Commission
and Village Council find that:
      (1)   The additional uses are necessary or desirable and are appropriate
with respect to the purpose and character of the PRD.
      (2)   The additional uses will not create a detrimental influence on the
neighborhoods surrounding the PRD, or upon the internal character of any part
of the PRD itself.
   (C)   Schedule 150.235(C) Permitted Uses. 
Schedule 150.235(C) sets forth the uses allowed in a PRD Overlay District. The

§ 150.236 MAXIMUM DENSITY.
   (A)   The maximum gross density in a PRD shall be as set forth in
Schedule 150.236(A) as determined by the base zoning, except as otherwise
permitted in §
150.236(B) and §
150.236(C).
 
SCHEDULE 150.236(A) PRD DENSITY
Base Zoning District Maximum Gross Density
R-E                  2.7

   (B)   Notwithstanding §
150.236(A), the Planning Commission and Village Council may approve a
preliminary development plan with a greater maximum gross density at the time a
rezoning application is being considered in compliance with the following.
      (1)   The Planning Commission and Village Council shall find that:
         (a)   The density of the underlying zoning is inappropriate or
unreasonable for the land being considered for a PRD based on, but not limited
to, such factors as: location, adjacent uses, current community objectives, and
natural constraints;
         (b)   The land, at the time of rezoning is not in an R-E, R-1, R-2, or
R-3 District; and
         (c)   The density will have no material adverse impact on the adjacent
properties compared to other reasonable uses that might be contemplated for the
property.
      (2)   In such case, the Planning Commission and Village Council shall
establish the maximum gross density in the ordinance adopting the PRD Overlay
District.
   (C)   Notwithstanding §
150.236(A), the Planning Commission and Village Council may establish a lower
maximum gross density for a proposed development when it finds that the PRD, at
the density permitted in §
150.236(A), will have an adverse effect on the character of the immediate
residential area when considering any one or more of the following:
      (1)   The unusual size and shape of the PRD parcel.
      (2)   The location and extent of sensitive natural areas such as
floodplain, steep slopes, streams, and wetlands.
      (3)   Limited size or shape of buildable area(s) because of
characteristics in subsection (C)(1) and (C)(2) above.
      (4)   The proximity of adjacent buildings and/or structures.

      (1)   Reflect and reinforce the existing and desired pedestrian-scaled
development pattern while accommodating the need for future growth;
      (2)   Preserve, maintain, enrich, and promote downtown Swanton as a core
area for retail sales and mixed uses, which enhance the existing historic,
compact pedestrian orientation of the downtown by permitting buildings to be
close to the street and to one another.
   (D)   To provide a General Business District (B-3) to accommodate businesses
that require large land areas and generate large volumes of traffic serving the
needs for shopping, convenience goods and services of the entire community.
   (E)   To provide for a Light Industrial District (M-1) and associated
regulations in order to achieve, among other things, the following:
      (1)   To provide in appropriate and convenient districts sufficient areas
for carrying on research, providing commercial services, manufacturing and
distributing goods to serve the community, to promote employment and to
strengthen the economy of the community;
      (2)   To provide for business, contracting, storage, distribution and
transportation services, and related types of minor production processes in
appropriate and convenient areas;
      (3)   To provide for limited heaver industrial uses in appropriate
locations for those products and processes that normally require a large amount
of motor vehicle trucking for the transportation of the raw materials and
finished products, but in which dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors or other
objectionable influences can be controlled;
      (4)   To improve the general environment by prohibiting dwellings,
institutions and public facilities in industrial districts, and by so doing,
make land more readily accessible for industry;
      (5)   To protect adjacent residential districts by restricting the types
of manufacturing uses in the surrounding areas to only those not creating
objectionable influences beyond industrial district boundaries and by
separating and insulating them from the most intense manufacturing activities;
and
      (6)   To protect manufacturing and related development against congestion
and promote the appropriate regulation of the size of buildings in relation to
the land and provide off-street parking and loading facilities.

§ 150.272 USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Use Schedule Summary. 
Schedule 150.272(D) sets forth the uses allowed in Business and Industrial
Districts. The abbreviations used in the Schedule indicate the following:
      (1)   Uses Permitted By Right. A “P” in a cell indicates that the use is
allowed by-right as a principal use in the respective district.
      (2)   Conditional Uses. A “C” in a cell indicates that the use is
regulated as a conditional use. The use is permitted in the respective district
only after an applicant receives Conditional Use approval pursuant to
Article 150.67.
      (3)   Accessory Uses. An “A” in a cell indicates that the use is a
permitted accessory use, provided it is clearly incidental and subordinate to a
permitted principal or conditional use listed in
Schedule 150.272(D).
      (4)   Conditional Accessory Uses. A “CA” in a cell indicates that the use
is permitted only as an accessory use and only after an applicant receives
Conditional Use approval pursuant to
Article 150.67.
      (5)   Uses Not Permitted. The letters “NP” in a District column indicate
that the use is not allowed in that zoning district.
      (6)   Use-Specific Standard Cross-Reference. An “*” in a cell indicates
that a Use-Specific Standard cross-referenced in the right-hand column of the
Schedule applies to the use in that zoning district.
   (B)   Compliance with Standards. Although a use may be indicated as a
permitted use in a particular district, it shall not be approved on a lot
unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards
and other regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and lot in
question, including but not limited to any supplemental use-specific standards
cross-referenced in
Schedule 150.272(D).
   (C)   Organization of Use Table. In the Use Table, land uses are classified
into general use categories and specific uses based on common physical or
functional characteristics, such as type of dwelling unit, amount of activity
generated by the use, and site conditions. Whenever a standard or reference is
made to a general use category throughout this code, it shall include the
specific uses in that category.
   (D)   Schedule 150.272(D) Permitted Uses. 
Schedule 150.272(D) sets forth the uses allowed in the Business and Industrial
Districts.

§ 150.275 REQUIRED DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The buildings in the Village’s Downtown Business District
define Swanton’s built environment and contribute to the character of the
community. Enhancing the quality and compatibility of these buildings and
thereby protecting the character of this areas is of utmost importance. The
standards set forth below are intended to achieve among others the following
purposes:
      (1)   To strengthen, protect, enhance and improve the existing visual and
aesthetic character of the B-2, Downtown, District;
      (2)   To protect and enhance property values; and
      (3)   To provide guidelines for property owners, architects, and
contractors to aid in the preparation of appropriate plans.
   (B)   Applicability of Regulations. In addition to the development standards
set forth in §
150.274, the design standards set forth in §
150.275(C) shall apply to the exterior appearance and design of all new
construction and building renovations in the B-2, Downtown District.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may grant an exemption from these standards
when the exterior building modifications are minor in nature, meaning the
design modifications will have no discernable impact on neighboring properties,
the public, the public right-of-way, or those intended to occupy or use the
proposed development.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may grant an exception or modification to
the Design Standards in §
150.275(C) if the applicant demonstrates that, due to the unusual shape or
topography of the lot or an adjoining lot, or due to the location or design of
existing structures, mature trees, or other features, the application of the
design standards would be unreasonable. The Planning Commission may grant a
complete exception from the standard, or it may modify the standard in view of
the peculiarities of the site. Any modification of the standard shall be
considered an “exception.” In determining whether to grant an exception, the
Planning Commission shall consider:
         (a)   The purposes of the Zoning District;
         (b)   The intent of the guideline from which the exception is
requested; and
         (c)   Whether the intent of the standard may be met by an alternate
means.
   (C)   Design Standards. The design standards set forth in this subsection
shall apply to the exterior appearance and design of all new construction and
building renovations in the B-2, Downtown District.
      (1)   Buildings and principal building entrances shall be oriented toward
the public street so as to define the street edge and contribute to a dynamic
pedestrian and street environment.
      (2)   The primary pedestrian entrance to the principal building shall be
located on a frontage line, adjacent to the public sidewalk.
      (3)   Windows and Doors on Primary Facades Facing a Street. Building
facades facing a street shall meet the following window and door design
standards:
         (a)   First Floor (Building Base) Façade. Transparent glass or framed
facade open areas consisting of display windows, entries and doors shall
comprise at least 60% of the wall/facade area between the height of two (2)
feet and ten (10) feet above the nearest sidewalk grade. The bottom edge of
such window shall not be higher than 30 inches above grade.
         (b)   Upper Floors facing a Street. Transparent glass or façade
openings shall comprise at least 30% of the wall/façade area for each floor
above the first floor.
         (c)   Window frames shall incorporate windowsills and lintels and/or
window heads that are visually distinct from the primary exterior finish
materials used on the façade on which it is located.
         (d)   A maximum of twenty (20) percent of the windows that can be seen
from all public rights-of-way, excluding alleys, shall be opaque.
      (4)   Each building façade, other than the front façade, that is visible
from a private right-of- way, public parking area or public circulation area
should incorporate design elements at least every 30 horizontal feet, such as
changes in color or texture and material modules; projections, recesses, and
reveals; arcades or pergolas providing pedestrian interest; or equivalent
elements that subdivide the wall into human scale proportions.
      (5)   Facade openings, including windows, shall be vertical in
proportion.
      (6)   Facades may be supplemented by awnings, which shall be straight
sheds with or without side flaps or curved.
      (7)   All roof top equipment shall be concealed in building materials
that match the structure or shall be painted to be visually compatible with the
structure.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.276 OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND SERVICE AREA REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Cross Access to Off-Street Parking Lots. Parking lots in the B-1 and
B-3 Districts should be interconnected with non-residential parking lots on
adjacent properties to the maximum extent feasible.
   (B)   Off-Site Facilities. Whenever the required accessory off-street
parking facilities are proposed to be located on a parcel other than the one
occupied by the principal building served, the Planning Commission shall
require a copy of the agreements covering such an arrangement as set forth in §
150.381 to ensure availability of shared parking to users.
   (C)   Setbacks for Joint Parking Facilities. When cross access between two
parking areas is required or provided, the parking setback shall not be
required for the opening which accommodates the drive aisle, but it shall be
required in all other areas that abut the shared property line. When shared
parking, which spans the mutual property line, is required or provided, the
parking setback is not required to be provided.
   (D)   Off Street Parking, Loading and Service Areas.
      (1)   Parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with
Article 150.37, Off-Street Parking & Loading Regulations.
      (2)   Off-street loading and service areas shall be located in the rear
yard in compliance with the applicable parking setback requirements set forth
in
Schedule 150.274(B), unless the Planning Commission determines that placement
in a side yard would lessen the impact on adjacent residential uses.
      (3)   Landscaping and Screening. The off-street parking areas, off-street
loading areas and service areas shall be landscaped and screened in accordance
with
Article 150.39, Landscaping, Screening, Fencing, and Lighting Regulations.
      (4)   Off-street parking shall be permitted on a lot only as an accessory
use to a permitted principal use. Off-street parking shall not be permitted as
the sole use of a lot.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.277 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Any use established in any business or industrial district after the
effective date of this zoning code shall comply with the performance standards
set forth in this section prior to occupancy or initiation of that use. Any use
already established in such districts shall not be altered, added to or
otherwise modified so as to conflict with, or further conflict with the

and devices standard to the operation involved. The storage, handling and use
of flammable or explosive materials shall conform to the requirements of the
codified ordinances of the village and all applicable laws of the state.
      (3)   Emission of Pollutants. The emission of any atmospheric pollutant
shall not exceed the level permitted by applicable federal or state

§ 150.278 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Accessory structures, including but not limited to sheds, garages, and
similar buildings, shall be permitted within the Business District (B2, B3) and
Industrial District (M1, M2) subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Location and Setbacks. Accessory structures must be located behind
the principal building on the property. A minimum setback of 5 feet from any
property line, and a minimum of 10 feet from any adjacent structure shall be
required for all accessory structures. Accessory structures may not be located
within easement areas or obstruct access to utilities.
      (2)   Size and Height Limitations. The height of the accessory building
shall not exceed twenty (20) feet. Accessory buildings that have a gross floor
area of 200 square feet or less may be located in a side or rear yard and shall
comply with the applicable parking setbacks set forth in Schedule

buildings and shall conform to all lot and setback regulations and development
plan review for the appropriate zoning district. Any structure exceeding these
dimensions require approval through a conditional use permit or variance
application.
      (3)   Design and Aesthetics. The exterior of the accessory structure must
be constructed of materials consistent with or complementary to the principal
building on the property. The structure should maintain a design that is
visually harmonious with the surrounding environment, ensuring it does not

      (6)   Maintenance and Removal. The property owner is responsible for
maintaining accessory structures in good condition. Structures that become
dilapidated, unsafe, or otherwise non-compliant with zoning or safety
regulations must be repaired or removed.
   (B)   Special Considerations for Certain Business Uses. In cases where the
proposed accessory structure is intended for retail sales, signage, or
displays, a special use permit must be obtained to ensure it aligns with the
overall goals and aesthetics of the Business or Industrial District.
   (C)   Enforcement and Penalties. Any accessory structure constructed in
violation of these provisions may be subject to penalties, fines, or removal at
the discretion of the Zoning Administrator or the Village Council.

§ 150.295 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Applicability of Regulations. The design guidelines set forth in §
150.295(B) shall apply to the exterior appearance and design of all new
construction in the Airport Highway Corridor Overlay District. Building
expansion shall comply with these guidelines at such time that the expansion
totals 50% or more of the existing square footage of the building.
   (B)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   Primary and Secondary Exterior Finishes. Building materials should
be typical of those prevalent along the Corridor. Facades shall consist of one
or more of the following primary and secondary exterior finish materials:
         (a)   Primary Exterior Finish Materials:
            i.   Cementitious siding;
            ii.   Masonry;
            iii.   Brick;
            iv.   Natural stone;
            v.   Precast concrete;
            vi.   Decorative block;
            vii.   Glass; and/or
            viii.   Decorative metal panels.
         (b)   Secondary Exterior Finish Materials:
            i.   Brick;
            ii.   Wood;
            iii.   EIFS; or
            iv.   Other products that replicate the appearance and durability
of the above materials, as approved by the Planning Commission.
         (c)   Materials within ten (10) feet of the ground or the sidewalk
shall be of a durable material to withstand pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
If “dry vit” or E.I.F.S is used as an exterior building material, impact
resistant E.I.F.S., as classified by EIMA (EIFS Industry Members Association),
shall be used on all wall areas within ten (10) feet of the ground or sidewalk.
         (d)   No facade visible from adjoining property or the public right-
of-way shall be constructed of reflective glass unadorned or unpainted CMU or
concrete block, smooth vinyl, corrugated metal, or sheet metal.
      (2)   Accessory structures. Building materials and colors on accessory
structures shall be compatible with that approved for the primary structure.
For example, canopies permitted as part of a vehicle fuel station shall use a
combination of brick columns and a metal canopy that is similar in color to the
primary structure.
      (3)   Type of Construction. Manufactured, mobile, and metal units are
prohibited except as may be allowed for temporary office management or storage
uses during the construction phase.
      (4)   Orientation. Building facades and entrances should be oriented
toward Airport Highway, not toward internal parking areas.
      (5)   Facades. Architectural elements such as windows and doors,
bulkheads, masonry piers, transoms, cornice lines, window hoods, awnings,
canopies, and other similar details should be used on all facades facing public
or private street rights-of-way. Building wall offsets, including projections,
and recesses are encouraged in order to: add architectural interest and
variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall; and subdivide the
wall into human size proportions. In order to offer pedestrian interest, the
ground level of any building should include windows, entrances, architectural
details and shed awnings. Architectural details should continue on all facades
visible from the public right-of-way.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.296 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Parking Location. Off-street parking areas shall be located to the
rear or side of the principal building on the lot and no closer to the front
lot line than the front façade of the largest principal building on the lot.
   (B)   Example of Appropriate Siting of Off-Street Parking Areas.

   (C)   Cross Access to Off-Street Parking Areas. Off-street parking areas
shall be interconnected with non-residential parking areas on adjacent
properties.
   (D)   Planning Commission Exceptions. The Planning Commission may grant an
exception to the requirements in §
150.296 where necessary due to the shallow depth of the parcel, the shape of
the parcel, the location of mature trees or other significant environmental
features, the location of existing buildings, the proximity of residential
uses, the location of existing traffic control devices, the location on access
points onto Airport Highway, or other similar circumstances.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.297 ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL PARCELS.
   (A)   Access along Airport Highway shall be reviewed relative to the
distance from other drive approaches and from roadway intersections. In some
instances, a frontage road shall be provided to allow access to other parcels
and to the adjoining parcel(s). In other instances, cross access easements and/
or a shared drive approach shall be required for adjoining parcels, unless
specially waived, in writing by the Village Engineer or the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Access shall be reviewed by the designated Village Engineer,
Planning Commission and/or the Ohio Department of Transportation. A traffic
impact study shall be required by the developer if the proposed use of the
property generates 100 or more peak hour trips, consistent with the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Generation Manual, unless such requirement is
specifically waived, in writing, by the Village Engineer.
   (B)   If requested, where there is a change of use to an existing
development, the designated Village Engineer, the Planning Commission or Ohio
Department of Transportation may make a recommendation to close access points
within the overlay district, which are deemed to be hazardous.

§ 150.333 SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS – RESIDENTIAL USES.
   (A)   Accessory Living Suite.
      (1)   Purpose. These standards for accessory living suites (“ALS”) are
intended to permit the creation of legal accessory living suites wholly within
one-family detached units in a manner that is compatible with and retains the
character of the residential neighborhood.
      (2)   This use shall only be permitted as accessory to and within a
legally existing or proposed one-family detached dwelling that is the sole
principal use on the lot. An ALS shall not be permitted in a two-family
dwelling, multi-family dwelling, or Bed & Breakfast.
      (3)   The property on which the ALS is located shall comply with the
following:
         (a)   The lot shall have a minimum lot area of 8,400 square feet.
         (b)   Not more than one accessory living suite shall be permitted
within the one-family detached dwelling on the lot.
         (c)   The one-family detached dwelling unit shall have and retain a
minimum dwelling unit floor area of 1,000 square feet, not counting the area of
the ALS.
      (4)   The design of the ALS shall comply with the following:
         (a)   The ALS shall occupy no more than thirty percent (30%) of the
heated floor area of the one-family dwelling, but in no case be greater than
500 square feet.
         (b)   The ALS shall not have a separate, outside entrance from the
exterior of the one- family dwelling.
      (5)   Parking for the ALS shall be served by the same driveway as the
one-family dwelling.
      (6)   The ALS shall not be rented for a term less than 30 days.
      (7)   The owner of the property shall reside in either the one-family
dwelling unit or the accessory living suite.
      (8)   The residence shall retain the appearance of a one-family dwelling
at all times.
   (B)   Bed and Breakfast Inn and Short-Term Rental. Bed and breakfast inns
and short-term rentals are unique semi-commercial operations that adapt a
residential dwelling unit into a lodging concept limited in scope and
operation. The regulations presented herein provide a systematic set of
requirements to ensure that such operations do not adversely affect adjacent
uses as a result of the commercial aspects of the structure and property.
      (1)   The bed and breakfast inn or short-term rental shall be subordinate
to the principal use of a one-family detached dwelling, and the residence shall
retain the appearance of a one-family dwelling at all times.
      (2)   The one-family detached dwelling unit shall be occupied by the
owner(s) of the property as his/her primary residence.
      (3)   The operator of the bed and breakfast inn or short-term rental
shall maintain a log of all guests, including their name, address, license
plate number, and length of stay, and shall make the log available to the
Zoning Inspector upon request.
      (4)   Required parking for guests, and employees when permitted, shall be
provided on-site. Parking shall be located behind the front line of the
principal building. The Planning Commission may grant an exception to this
requirement due to the shallow depth of the parcel, the location of existing
buildings and mature trees, or other similar circumstances.
      (5)   Exterior lighting shall be residential in character and compatible
with the surrounding neighborhood.
      (6)   The dwelling shall fully comply with all applicable Village, County
and State codes, including but not limited to income tax, building, fire, and
health requirements.
      (7)   The owner shall maintain weekly residential trash collection
services. Trash dumpsters, trash containers, recycling containers, and
mechanical equipment shall be screened per the requirements of §
150.398, Screening of Accessory Uses.
      (8)   Bed and breakfast inns shall comply with the following additional
requirements:
         (a)   Each guest stay shall be limited to consecutive days of less
than one week.
         (b)   No more than four (4) rooms shall be utilized as guest sleeping

§ 150.355 COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, sign setbacks, building frontage, and window area.
   (A)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   Sign area shall include the face of the entire display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the structural support unless such structural
support is an integral part of the sign design.
      (2)   The surface area of a sign shall be computed by calculating the
area of the sign face.
      (3)   Sign Area.
         (a)   Framed: A sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise
prepared and intended to include a background for the sign display, the sign
area shall include the entire portion within such frame or background.
         (b)   Nonframed: For a sign comprised of individual elements such as
letters, symbols, or other graphic objects or representations that are painted,
attached to, or otherwise affixed to a surface such as a wall, window, canopy,
or awning, the sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas of
the smallest geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes capable of
encompassing the perimeters of the individual elements comprising the sign.
When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated
by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining
the geometric shape, or combination of shapes, that comprises all of the
display areas, including the space between different elements. Minor appendages
to a particular regular shape, as determined by the Zoning Administrator or
Planning Commission, shall not be included in the total area of a sign.
      (4)   Freestanding Sign Area.
         (a)   When two identical, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back or
at angles of 30 degrees or less, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any
one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure and are not more than 12 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the two faces are unequal,
the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two faces.
         (b)   No more than two display faces shall be permitted for one sign.
   (B)   Determining Sign Height.
      (1)   The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the distance
from the highest portion of the sign including frame and structural members to
the average finished grade of the street closest to the sign.
      (2)   In the case of a sign located greater than 100 feet from a public
street, height shall be measured to the average finished grade at the base of
the sign. The finished grade shall be construed to be the newly established
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or
excavating solely undertaken for the purpose of locating or increasing the
height of the sign.
      (3)   Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be measured
as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point
of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments.
   (C)   Sign Setbacks.
      (1)   The required setbacks for a sign shall apply to all elements of the
sign, including its frame and base.
      (2)   The setback of a freestanding sign or projecting sign shall be
measured horizontally from the outward edge of the sign frame to the street
right-of-way or lot line, as applicable.
   (D)   Determining Building Frontage, Building Units, and Building Facades.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Article, building frontage includes the
length of any building wall described below:
         (a)   Any building wall that faces a public or private street;
         (b)   Any building wall that contains a public entrance to the uses
therein.
      (2)   The calculation of the width or lineal measurement of any building
frontage shall be the measurement of the façade between two side facades. The
calculation shall be based on viewing the façade from a 90-degree angle (i.e.,
straight on), regardless of façade insets, offsets, or angles. See Figure
150.355(D).

      (3)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single occupant or tenant shall be considered a building unit.
The building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline
of the party walls defining the building unit.
   (E)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than 15 feet in height above grade.

§ 150.361 NONCONFORMING, ABANDONED AND ILLEGAL SIGNS.
   (A)   Maintenance. Nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good condition
and structural parts may be repaired or restored to a safe condition if
required, and if a permit is issued; provided, however, that any sign or parts
thereof which have been blown down, destroyed or otherwise taken down for any
purpose, shall not be rebuilt, re-erected or relocated unless it shall be made
to comply with the provisions of this zoning code and the state building code.
Any repainting, cleaning and other normal maintenance or repair of the sign or
sign structure shall not modify the sign structure in any way which makes it
more nonconforming or the sign may lose its legal nonconforming status.
   (B)   Alteration and Removal of Nonconforming Signs.
      (1)   Nonconforming signs shall be removed and any subsequent
modification or replacement, excluding maintenance pursuant to §
150.360 shall conform to all requirements of this chapter:
         (a)   When more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the sign has
been destroyed or has been taken down; or
         (b)   When the use to which the nonconforming sign is accessory is
vacant for ninety consecutive days.
      (2)   Following six (6) years from the date of the amendment to this
Article that made the sign nonconforming, unless an extension is granted by the
Planning Commission.
         (a)   The Planning Commission may extend the time for removal of a
nonconforming sign for a period that is the lesser of the remaining depreciable
life of the nonconforming sign or five years.
         (b)   Any such extension shall be subject to the criteria for granting
variances set forth in
Article 150.69. In determining the depreciable life of a nonconforming sign,
the Planning Commission may consider the depreciable life determined by the
owner of such sign, but may also consider other standard accounting principles.
      (3)   A nonconforming sign shall not be altered, modified or
reconstructed except:
         (a)   When such alteration, modification or reconstruction would bring
such sign into conformity with these regulations;
         (b)   When the existing use has new ownership which results in a
change in the name or logo of the use or business on the property, and such
change complies with subsection (4) below;
         (c)   When the space is reoccupied by a similar use and the new
occupant requires no external building or site renovation, and such change
complies with subsection (4) below;
         (d)   Any alteration, modification or reconstruction permitted in this
section shall be limited to the replacement of a sign panel, replacing
individual letters and logos within the same area or repainting a sign face,
and does not permit changes to the structure, framing, erection or relocation
of the sign unless such changes conform to subsection (1) above.
      (4)   A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming
status and thereafter must be brought into conformance with this article or
removed whenever alterations to a nonconforming sign changes the structure,
framing or erection or relocation of the sign.
   (C)   Abandoned Signs.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Section, any sign that is
located on property which becomes vacant and is unoccupied for a period of 90
days or more, or any sign which pertains to a time, event, or purpose which no
longer applies, shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
         (a)   An abandoned sign is prohibited and shall be removed by the
owner of the sign or owner of the premises.
         (b)   Permanent signs applicable to a business temporarily suspended
because of a change of ownership or management of such business shall not be
deemed abandoned unless the property remains vacant for a period of 120 days or
more.
      (2)   Whenever the removal of an abandoned sign has been ordered by the
Zoning Administrator, the person, firm, or corporation who erected, affixed, or
attached such a sign or display, shall remove such sign within 30 days after
receiving such notice.
         (a)   In the event of noncompliance, the Zoning Administrator is
authorized to commence legal action for an order to remove such sign at the
expense of (b) person, firm or corporation who erects such sign or on whose
premises it was erected, affixed or attached.
         (b)   The sign area shall be replaced by a neutral, single background
color panel or similar cover. If the sign is comprised of individually raised
letters, the letters shall be removed and any holes in the building’s façade
shall be repaired.
         (c)   The person, firm or corporation who erects such sign or on whose
premises it was erected, affixed or attached shall be individually and
separately liable for all expenses incurred by the Village to remove the sign.
   (D)   Illegal Signs. Signs erected in violation of the Code shall be removed
by the owner, tenant, occupant and/or sign applicant, or person having the
beneficial use of the building, structure, or land upon which such sign is
located, within 90 days after receipt of written notice by the Zoning
Administrator. Upon failure to remove the sign pursuant to such order, the
Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized to commence legal action for an order
to remove the sign. All expenses incurred by the Village to remove the sign
shall be paid by the owner of the property on which the sign is located.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.362 APPLICATION FOR SIGN PERMIT.
   (A)   Application generally. The application for a sign permit shall be made
by the owner or tenant of the property on which the sign is to be located, or
his or her authorized agent, or sign contractor.
      (1)   Such application shall be made in writing on forms furnished by the
Zoning Administrator and shall be signed by the applicant.
      (2)   A sign permit shall be required for all permanent signs and each
application shall be accompanied by a drawing (to scale), showing the
following:
         (a)   The design and layout proposed, including the total area of the
sign, the size, character, materials and color of letters, lines and symbols;
         (b)   The method of illumination, if any;
         (c)   The exact location of the sign in relation to the structure of

been properly made and the sign complies with all appropriate laws and
regulations of the village.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may, in writing, suspend or revoke a
permit issued under provisions of this section whenever the permit is issued on
the basis of misstatement of fact or fraud. When a sign permit is denied by the
Zoning Administrator, he or she shall give written notice of the denial to the
applicant, together with a brief written statement of the reasons for the
denial.
   (C)   Effect of issuance. No permit for a sign issued hereunder shall be
deemed to constitute permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign
nor shall any permit issued hereunder constitute a defense in any action to
abate an unlawful sign.
   (D)   Fees.
      (1)   The applicant shall pay the sign fee established by council, which
shall accompany each application.
      (2)   When any sign is installed on any property prior to obtaining all
necessary permits, the normal fee for that sign shall be doubled. The late fee
shall not relieve the owner of the sign from complying with all other
provisions of this zoning code.

§ 150.371 INTENT.
   Off-street parking and loading requirements are established in order to
achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (A)   To provide regulations for the development of accessory off-street
parking and loading facilities in accordance with the objectives of this Zoning
Code so as to:
      (1)   Ensure a sufficient number of off-street parking spaces are
provided on site in proportion to the need of the use;
      (2)   Relieve congestion so the streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
      (3)   Promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
locating parking areas so as to lessen car movements in the vicinity of
intensive pedestrian traffic and minimize external effects on adjacent
properties;
      (4)   Protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from excessive on-
street parking;
      (5)   Promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of
business, service, research, production and manufacturing developments which
depend upon off-street parking facilities; and
   (B)   To provide for accommodation of vehicles in a functionally and
aesthetically satisfactory manner.
   (C)   To allow flexibility in addressing vehicle parking and access issues.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.372 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Compliance Required. Accessory off-street parking facilities shall be
provided in compliance with the provisions of this Article prior to the
occupancy of a building, structure, land, or portion thereof whenever:
      (1)   A new building is constructed or a new use is established.
      (2)   An existing building is altered such that there is an increase in
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity, floor area of a building, or
employees. In the case of such expansions and enlargements, additional parking,
loading, and waiting spaces are required to serve only the enlarged or expanded
area.
      (3)   The use of an existing building or structure or use of land is
changed to a use that requires more off street parking facilities.
      (4)   Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) above, certain
nonconforming uses may continue as provided in §
150.416.
   (B)   Existing Uses. The requirements of this Article shall not apply to
buildings and uses legally existing on the effective date of this Article,
except when the use is changed or modified in a manner described in §
150.372(A), such as but not limited to when a single-family dwelling is
converted to a two-family dwelling. Any existing parking facility serving an
existing building or use shall be continued and maintained in operation and
shall not be reduced below the capacity that was provided on the effective date
of this amendment unless an equivalent number of spaces shall be provided for
said use in another approved location, in compliance with this Article.
   (C)   Expansion/Alteration of Existing Parking and Loading Facilities.
      (1)   Parking lot expansion. Whenever an existing parking lot or loading
area is enlarged to cover a greater surface area, the entire parking lot and/or
loading area shall be made to conform with the current requirements for paving,
storm sewer, and landscaping, to the maximum extent practicable as determined
by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Alterations or repairs may be made to any existing parking lot and/
or loading area without requiring the existing facility to comply with all
requirements of this Article, provided the alteration or repair conforms to the
requirements applicable specifically to such alteration or repair set forth
herein.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.373 APPLICATION AND DESIGN.
   (A)   Any application for a zoning permit to construct a building with
requisite parking facilities, or for a certificate of zoning compliance for a
change in use of land or a building, shall include a development plan drawn to
scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed design of the parking area
and loading facilities to be provided in compliance with the provisions of this
Article and
Article 150.65, Development Plan Review.
   (B)   The development plan shall be accompanied by a storm water management
plan for all parking areas. Storm water calculations, including detention
plans, shall be submitted for review to the Planning Commission, Village
Engineer and Village Administrator. No zoning permit or zoning certificate
shall be issued until an adequate storm water management plan has been approved
in accordance with
Article 150.65 Development Plan Review.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.374 USE OF FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking and loading facilities accessory to an existing use on
the effective date of this Zoning Code, and those required as accessory to a
use created or a building constructed or altered thereafter, shall be continued
and maintained in operation, and shall not be used for the sales, service or
repair of motor vehicles or for any other outdoor uses, except when
specifically authorized by the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.375 UNITS OF MEASURE.
   (A)   Computations. In computing the number of parking spaces required by
this Code, the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, “floor area” shall mean the total area
of all floors of the building used by the principal activity as specified in
Schedule 150.374, measured from the exterior faces of the building. The areas
used for storage or otherwise not occupied by people may be excluded from the
floor area calculation, when approved by the Planning Commission, according to
§
150.378.
      (2)   Seats. Whenever the parking requirements are based on seating
capacity, capacity shall be determined by:
         (a)   The number of seating units indicated on the development plan;
or
         (b)   One seat for each 24 lineal inches of benches or pews indicated
on the development plan; or
         (c)   One seat for each 20 square feet of gross floor area of the
assembly room(s).
      (3)   Employees. Whenever the parking requirements are based on
employees, it shall mean the maximum number of employees on duty on the
premises at any one time or on any two successive shifts, whichever is greater.
   (B)   Fractional Numbers. When the computation results in a fractional unit,
the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
   (C)   Parking for Mixed Uses. When a building or group of buildings on a
development site contains two or more uses, the number of parking spaces for
each use shall be computed separately. The total spaces provided shall not be
less than the sum of the spaces required for each use, except as otherwise
provided for in §
150.380.
   (D)   Parking Requirements for Uses Not Specified. When the off street
parking requirements for a use are not specifically defined herein, the parking
facilities for such use shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator based
on the standard most similar to the proposed use.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.376 SCHEDULE OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities shall be provided in quantities not

§ 150.377 PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B-2 DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   In recognition of the historic, compact character of buildings in the B-
2 Downtown Business District, the Planning Commission may approve a development
plan with up to a fifty percent (50%) reduction in the requirements of
Schedule 150.376, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, for nonresidential uses.
To request such a reduction, an applicant shall submit a parking assessment at
the time a development plan is submitted that includes the information detailed
in §
150.377(B).
   (A)   In making a determination for such a reduction, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   The character of the proposed use and the ability of the proposed
use to reinforce the central business district environment;
      (2)   The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both
on-street and within public parking lots;
      (3)   The availability of parking spaces on adjacent and nearby sites,
considering the hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent
uses; and
      (4)   The potential negative impact to the character of Downtown Swanton
if the requisite number of parking spaces are provided.
   (B)   The parking assessment shall include a description of the use and its
anticipated relationship to, and impact on, the surrounding parcels. At a
minimum, the assessment shall include the following:
      (1)   The nature of the proposed use(s), activities and events that will
be accommodated, including hours of operation and peak hours of occupancy.
      (2)   The estimated number of parking spaces required at peak capacity.
      (3)   The number of parking spaces required according to
Schedule 150.376 compared to the number of spaces proposed.
      (4)   The current supply and utilization of public parking spaces in the
immediate area.
      (5)   How available spaces meet the needs of the proposed use.
      (6)   Suggested parking management solutions to address any anticipated
discrepancy between the number of parking spaces available and anticipated
parking demand.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may authorize additional reductions in parking
spaces in the B-2 District in compliance with §
150.380, Allowance for Shared Parking, and with §
150.381, Allowance for Off-Site Parking.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.378 MODIFICATION OF STANDARDS.
   Off-street parking requirements may be reduced in the Village based on the
provisions of this Section.
   (A)   A reduction of up to ten percent (10%) of the number of required
parking spaces may be permitted administratively by the Zoning Administrator
when the applicant demonstrates that the reduction in parking will not impact
adjacent uses.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may approve a reduction in required parking
spaces by up to forty percent (40%) as a conditional use in accordance with the
procedures set forth in
Article 150.67, when the applicant demonstrates in a parking assessment,
prepared by a traffic consultant in accordance with §
150.377(B)(1)(6), or in parking data from comparable sites provided that:
      (1)   The use of transportation demand management programs and/or special
characteristics of the customer, client, employee or resident population will
reduce expected vehicle use and parking space demand for this development, as
compared to the minimum Village parking requirements; and
      (2)   The reduction in parking will not impact adjacent uses.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.379 DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   If the number of parking spaces required by this Article for a
nonresidential use is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the
applicant and the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports the
reduced parking needs, a development plan may be approved with an allowance for
the construction of a lesser number of parking spaces provided that:
   (A)   The total number of spaces initially constructed on the site of the
principal use shall not be less than 70% of the spaces required by this
Article.
   (B)   Suitable area is reserved for the construction of the balance of the
total number of spaces otherwise required by this Article. Such suitable areas
shall be illustrated on the development plan in locations and with landscaping
in full compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (C)   The Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project’s parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the parking spaces identified
in subsection (B) be constructed, and shall notify the property owner of such
determination.
   (D)   When additional parking is determined necessary, it shall be provided
according to the approved development plan.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.380 ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   Developments that contain a mix of uses on the same parcel or two or more
uses on separate parcels may share parking spaces to satisfy a portion of the
minimum off-street parking requirement in compliance with the requirements of
this Section.
   (A)   The required number of parking spaces for the combined uses may be
reduced by 30% for shared parking when hours of operation overlap.
   (B)   The parking facility to be shared shall be owned by the owner of one
of the uses or leased for at least a 20-year term or through a permanent
easement by the owner of the uses being served. Such lease or easement shall be
approved by the Village Solicitor.
   (C)   No changes shall be made to the shared parking facility that would
reduce the number of parking spaces provided for the uses, unless the owner of
one of the uses makes other arrangements to provide parking. No such changes
shall be made without Zoning Administrator approval prior to any changes taking
place.
   (D)   Handicap parking spaces shall not be shared, unless the uses that are
to share the spaces are adjacent to the handicap spaces and no inconvenience to
the users of such spaces would be created.
   (E)   Any proposed change in the use of a structure that shares a parking
facility will require proof to the Zoning Administrator that adequate parking
is available.
   (F)   Parking facilities to be shared shall be located on the same lot or
lots as the use for which the parking spaces are intended, except when the
parking facility complies with all the requirements of §
150.381, Allowance for Off-Site Parking.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.381 ALLOWANCE FOR OFF-SITE PARKING.
   All off street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the
structure or use unless parking spaces are provided in compliance with all the
requirements of this Section.
   (A)   The use shall provide at least 50% of the required parking spaces on
the site. The Planning Commission may grant an exception to this requirement
under the following criteria:
      (1)   Proximity of the proposed parking area to the use served;
      (2)   Ease and safety of access between the proposed parking area and the
use served;
      (3)   The use to be served by the offsite parking; and
      (4)   The hours of operation of the use to be served by the off-site
parking.
   (B)   Offsite spaces shall be within 500 feet walking distance, measured
along the pedestrian route to a building entrance or use. Safe and convenient
pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, shall exist or be provided from
the structure or use to the parking lot. Appropriate safety measures shall be
provided if the pedestrian must cross an arterial street.
   (C)   Contiguous lots providing off-street parking for more than one use
shall provide sufficient parking spaces to comply with the combined total
parking requirements for all uses unless an allowance for shared parking is
granted under §
150.380.
   (D)   The offsite lot may be located in another business or industrial
zoning district than the structure or use it serves.
   (E)   The lot used as an off-site parking facility shall be owned or leased
for at least a 20 year term or acquired through a permanent easement by the
owner of the use being served. The Village Solicitor shall approve the lease or
easement. Such lease or easement shall require the owner of the land on which
the parking facilities are to be located to be bound by a covenant filed and
recorded in the office of the County Recorder of Fulton or Lucas County,
requiring each such owner, his or her heirs, or assigns to maintain the
required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served as a
condition to the continuation of such use. If the term of the use is limited by
a conditional use permit, then the term of the lease agreement for parking may
be limited accordingly. At the expiration of the term of a lease or extensions
thereof, the owner shall provide other suitable parking with sufficient parking
spaces or end the use that required the parking.
   (F)   The number of off-site parking spaces shall not be reduced, unless
other sufficient parking spaces are provided by the owner of the use. The
Zoning Administrator’s approval is required prior to changing the approved
parking plan.
   (G)   All required handicapped parking spaces for a use shall be located on
site.
   (H)   All required loading spaces shall be located on site.
   (I)   An existing nonconforming parking lot used under this Section as off-
site parking shall be landscaped, paved and striped according to the standards
of this Article and the Zoning Code.

temporary parking/waiting spaces.
   (D)   Parking Lots Adjacent to Buildings. Off street parking spaces for a
use other than a single or two-family dwelling shall be located at least ten

   (B)   Perimeter Landscaping Requirements. Perimeter landscaping shall be
required along any side of a parking lot that abuts adjoining property that is
not a right-of-way.
      (1)   The landscaped strip shall be the depth of the minimum parking
setback set forth in this Zoning Code for the district in which the lot is
located, except as otherwise regulated in
Article 150.33 Use-Specific Standards and shall be located between the parking
area and the abutting property lines.
      (2)   The landscaped strip shall be planted with one medium or large
deciduous or two small deciduous trees for every forty (40) lineal feet of
parking lot abutting the property line. The trees shall be arranged within the
landscaped strip to create varied and attractive views and do not have to be
equally spaced.
      (3)   This landscaping strip shall be free of any wall, fence, embankment
and/or walkway. Such wall, fence, etc. may exist or be constructed on the edge
of such landscape strip.
      (4)   The requirements of this subsection shall not apply where cross-
access and/or shared parking is provided between parking facilities on
adjoining lots and where planting is required for screening pursuant to §
150.398, Buffering and Screening between Districts and Uses.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.398 BUFFERING AND SCREENING BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND USES.
   (A)   Intent. This section is intended to buffer the effects of uses on
adjacent properties by requiring a screen and/or buffer between uses in order
to minimize the harmful impacts of noise, dust/debris, headlight glare and
other objectionable activities by an adjoining or nearby use. Any screening
buffer area must be maintained in good order at all times by the owner of the
property. When deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to provide a visual
screen, additional landscaping or other improvements may be required.
   (B)   Screening. Screening, as required by the provisions of this Code,
shall be of such nature and density that it will screen the activities on the
lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot.
   (C)   When Required. A buffer yard shall be required when:
      (1)   A lot in any Business, Industrial, or Public/Open Space District
abuts a Residential District;
      (2)   A lot in the Multi-family or the Manufactured Home Park Districts
abuts a One-Family Residential District;
      (3)   A lot in a Residential District is devoted to a nonresidential use;
      (4)   Required by the Use-Specific Standards in
Article 150.33; and
      (5)   When any wall of a nonresidential building in a Business/Industrial
District faces or is across the street from a Residential District, screening
shall be installed along the full length of such street frontage. No screening
shall be required when the Business/Industrial District lot is either not in
use or is used for residential purposes.
   (D)   Width of Buffer Yard. The width of the buffer yard shall be equal to
the minimum parking setback set forth in the applicable zoning district or
fifteen (15) feet, whichever is greater.
   (E)   Location. The buffer yard shall be located entirely within the higher
intensity zoning district or use and abutting the zoning district line or lot
line of lower intensity use. However, the buffer yard may be placed in the
lower intensity zoning district or partially within both zoning districts if
both sides of the zoning district line and the entire buffer yard width are
within common ownership and a permanent easement is provided over any portion
of the buffer yard not within the higher intensity zoning district. If a buffer
yard is located in a residential development that has an owners’ association or
other similar legal entity, all buffer yards shall be located in open space
owned by the association or in an open space easement controlled by the owners’
association.
   (F)   Screening. When the natural vegetation within the required buffer yard
does not form a solid, continuous, visual screen or does not have a minimum
height of six (6) feet along the entire length of the common boundary at the
time of occupancy, except as provided for in subsection (F)(3)(b) below,
screening shall be installed in compliance with the following:
      (1)   Screening Materials. Screening design and development shall be
compatible with the existing and proposed land use and development character of
the surrounding land and structures. Screening within the buffer yard shall
consist of one or more or combination thereof of the following:
         (a)   A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees and/or shrubs of
a variety which shall be equally effective in winter and summer. Trees and/or
shrubs shall be adequately spaced to form a solid, continuous visual screen
within one (1) year after the initial installation. At a minimum, at the time
of planting, the spacing of trees shall not exceed twelve (12) feet on center,
and the planting pattern shall be staggered. Shrubbery shall be more closely
spaced.
         (b)   Non-living opaque structures, such as a solid masonry wall, that
is compatible with the principal structure or a solid wood fence together with
a landscaped area at least fifteen (15) feet wide. For solid fences, fences
shall be designed, constructed, and finished so that the supporting members
face the property owner of the fence and they shall be maintained in good
condition, be structurally sound, and attractively finished at all times.
         (c)   An ornamental fence with openings through which light and air
may pass together with a landscaped area at least fifteen (15) feet wide. A
chain link fence shall not be permitted.
         (d)   A landscaped mound or berm at least seven feet wide, with a
slope no more than a 3:1. Where the mound or berm is to be mowed, the maximum
permitted slope is 4:1.
      (2)   Installation of Screening. Screening shall be continuous and in
place at the time of occupancy. If vehicular or pedestrian access through the
screen is necessary, the screening function shall be preserved.
      (3)   Height of Screening. The height of screening shall be in accordance
with the following:
         (a)   Visual screening by walls, fences, or mounds in combination with
vegetation, fences or walls shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high measured
from the natural grade on any adjacent residential lot, except as set forth in
subsection (b) below.
         (b)   Whenever the required screening is located within a front yard
or within twenty-five (25) feet of a parking lot, drive, or driveway entrance,
the required screening shall not exceed a height of three (3) feet.
         (c)   When used alone, vegetation shall be a minimum of six (6) feet
high, as measured from the natural grade on any adjacent residential lot, in
order to accomplish the desired screening effect. The required height shall be
achieved no later than one (1) year after the initial installation.
      (4)   Modifications to Buffering and Screening Requirements. Buffer yards
required by this Article shall be applied equally to all similarly situated
properties. The Planning Commission is empowered to modify the above buffer
yard and screening requirements when it determines that:
         (a)   Natural land characteristics, such as topography or existing
vegetation on the proposed building site, would achieve the same intent as this
Section.
         (b)   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on
the building site to achieve an equivalent screening and buffering effect.
         (c)   The required screening and landscaping would be ineffective at
maturity due to the proposed topography of the site, and/or the location of the
improvements on the site.
         (d)   The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites is such as to
render required screening ineffective at maturity.
         (e)   It can be clearly demonstrated that it is highly improbable that
the abutting property will be developed for residential purposes due to
circumstances that have taken place since the adoption of this Code.

§ 150.399 SCREENING OF ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   Screening of accessory uses shall be provided according to the following:
   (A)   Trash Collection Areas.
      (1)   Trash and/or garbage collection and service areas shall be enclosed
on all sides by a solid wall or fence and a solid gate at least 1 foot higher
than the highest refuse container in the collection area if such area is not
within an enclosed building or structure, but in no case shall the wall or
fence be less than six (6) feet in height. Such solid wall or solid fence shall
be situated so as to screen the view of the collection area from adjacent
properties and visibility from the street.
      (2)   The wall or fence shall be constructed of wood, brick, decorative
concrete, split face block, stone, or a synthetic material manufactured to look
like the approved material.
      (3)   These enclosures shall be located at least five (5) feet from the
property line, unless otherwise specifically regulated in this Code.
      (4)   The screen shall provide access to the trash and/or garbage
collection area by using a wooden fence or other opaque device to serve as a
gate.
      (5)   Trash receptacles and enclosures serving commercial or industrial
uses shall be located on the same lot as the use served and shall not be
located in residential districts.
   (B)   Ground mounted Mechanical Equipment. Ground mounted mechanical
equipment shall be screened with evergreen plant material so the equipment is
completely obscured from view within four (4) years.
   (C)   Outdoor Loading Areas. Permitted outdoor loading areas for vehicles
other than step vans and other light-duty trucks shall be enclosed with a solid
fence or wall and solid gates. The wall or fence shall be high enough to
conceal all operations and materials from the view of an observer standing at
the grade level of an abutting lot or a public street, but in no case shall the
wall or fence be less than six (6) feet in height. The wall or fence shall be
constructed of wood, brick, decorative concrete, split face block, stone, or a
synthetic material manufactured to look like the approved material.
   (D)   Landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be required within an area
screened for accessory uses.

      (2)   The Village shall furnish such inspection as deemed necessary to
determine that such said fence is constructed in accordance with plans
submitted for the permit. The issuance of a permit, by the village, shall not
be construed to mean that the village has determined said fence is not
encroaching upon another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of duty
imposed upon him or her herein.

§ 150.412 LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any building, structure, land,
site condition, or use of such building, structure or land, hereafter becoming
nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this Zoning Code as well as
amendments made to this Zoning Code or the Official Zoning Map.
   (A)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure and of any land
use or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enacting this Zoning
Code, may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of
this zoning code. The completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension or
substitution of such nonconforming use shall be subject to the provisions and
conditions as set forth in this Article.

not constitute a nonconformity with regulations if such nonconformity was
permitted pursuant to a legally granted variance from a zoning regulation.
   (C)   Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located. For the purpose of this Zoning Code,
ordinary repairs shall also include the replacement of equipment which is
required for safety of operation, and the replacement or substitutions of
machinery or equipment.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.413 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR LAND.
   A nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
regulations:
   (A)   Change or Substitution of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be
changed or substituted to another nonconforming use unless the Planning
Commission finds that the use proposed is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use, and that the
use proposed is in less conflict with the character of uses permitted in the
applicable zoning district than the existing nonconforming use.
      (2)   In permitting such change, the Planning Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other provisions of
this Zoning Code and when made a part of the terms under which the change is
granted.
      (3)   Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed shall be
deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and shall be punishable under
Article 150.71, Enforcement and Penalties.
      (4)   If the Planning Commission permits a change or substitution of a
nonconforming use, whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming
use.
   (B)   Change of Nonconforming Use to Permitted Use. Whenever a nonconforming
use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which the lot is located,
it shall cease to be considered a nonconforming use. Whenever such a change is
made, no nonconforming use shall be resumed or reinstated.
   (C)   Land Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Expansion of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of land
shall not be physically enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming,
unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of
land shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming.
   (D)   Structures Occupied by Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   Extension of Nonconforming Use within Building. A nonconforming use
of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building
that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption
or amendment to this Zoning Code. However, no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by such
nonconforming use.
      (2)   Expansion of Building(s). No building occupied by a nonconforming
use shall be enlarged or expanded to increase the nonconforming use, and no
additional structures shall be constructed in connection with such
nonconforming use unless the Planning Commission determines that the proposed
expansion and/or improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the resulting
development more compatible to the district for which it is zoned and more
compatible with the adjacent uses. In making this determination, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following:
         (a)   Hours of operation;
         (b)   Volume and type of sales;
         (c)   Type of processing activity;
         (d)   Nature and location of storage;

      (3)   Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming Use.
Except as provided for in subsection (D)(4) below, no building or structure
occupied by a nonconforming use shall be reconstructed except when the use is
changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, or upon
prior approval of the Planning Commission determines that the proposed
improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the resulting development more
compatible to the district for which it is zoned and more compatible to the
adjacent uses.
      (4)   Damage or Destruction of Building Occupied by a Nonconforming Use.
         (a)   Any building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use that
has been destroyed or damaged by fire, other casualty, act of God or by a
public enemy to the extent of 50% or more of its cost of restoration to the
condition in which it was before the occurrence, shall thereafter conform to
all the provisions of this zoning code.
         (b)   The total structural repairs, improvements and alterations
including repairs occasioned by fire, other casualty, act of God or by a public
enemy to the extent of less than 50% of its cost of restoration, shall not,
exceed 50% of the current reproduction value of the structure, unless the
structure or use be permanently changed to a conforming use.
         (c)   Determination of the reproduction value shall be made by three
practicing building construction contractors, one to be appointed by the owner,
one to be appointed by the village, and the third to be selected by the mutual
consent of the two parties.
         (d)   In the case of repair or replacement of partial destruction of
the structure, a zoning permit shall be applied for within six months of the
destruction and repairs shall be completed within six months of the issuance of
the permit or the nonconforming use shall be considered to be abandoned.
   (E)   Discontinuance and Abandonment. Any nonconforming use of land or a
building or structure shall be considered abandoned when the owner, lessee or
tenant has voluntarily discontinued such use for two consecutive years.

§ 150.414 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A nonconforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied by
a use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (A)   Enlargement, Repair, and Alterations. A nonconforming building or
structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered
provided the additions are made to conform to all the regulations of the
district in which it is located. However, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair, or structural alteration shall either create any additional
nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such building or structure with respect to the regulations in this
Zoning Code.
   (B)   Moving. A nonconforming building or structure may be moved to a
different location on the same lot or other parcel of land within the district,
with approval of the Planning Commission, after a hearing, and provided proper
and adequate alterations are scheduled to make the building or structure
conform to the regulations of the district where it is to be located.
   (C)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure, provided the reconstruction is begun within six
(6) months of the damage or destruction. Any restoration that exceeds the
original footprint and/or floor area shall comply with §
150.413(D)(4)(b)-(d).
   (D)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use, except the regulations
to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (E)   Variances. Variances from district regulations on area, lot coverage,
lot width, height, setbacks, location on the lot may be granted by the Planning
Commission where necessary and where such variance meets the requirements of an
area variance.

regulations of this Zoning Code, except the lot area and lot width regulations
of the district in which the lot is located.
      (2)   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Nonconforming Lot. If a
nonconforming lot is occupied by a dwelling, such dwelling may be maintained,
repaired or altered; provided, however, the dwelling shall not be enlarged in
floor area unless the expansion complies with the depth of the front setback,
width of side setbacks and the rear setback regulations. No portion of the new
building shall increase the nonconforming condition.
   (B)   Vacant Nonconforming Lot(s) of Record.
      (1)   Nonconforming Lot(s) of Record in a Residential District. A
nonconforming lot in a Single-family or Multi-family Residential District may

         (a)   No adjoining vacant lot or parcel of land was owned by the same
owner on the effective date of this zoning code;
         (b)   No adjoining land, or other vacant land can be equitably
acquired; and
         (c)   All other regulations of this zoning code, except the lot area
and width regulations, shall be complied with.
      (2)   Vacant Nonconforming Lot in a Nonresidential District. A vacant
nonconforming lot in a nonresidential district may be used for any use
permitted in the district in which it is located when the development of such
lot meets all development requirements of the district in which it is located,
including the maximum lot coverage and minimum setback requirements, except for
the minimum lot area and lot width requirements, except that no use that
requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a
particular district shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot. Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the development plan review requirements set forth in Article 150.65.

REVIEW.
   If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a revised development plan
is required pursuant to
Article 150.65, then such site condition(s) shall be brought into compliance
with district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions.
Existing site conditions include, but are not limited to, the existing lot
configuration and patterns of surrounding development; inability of the
applicant to acquire additional property; location of the existing structures
on the site in question; the location of parking and access on the site in
question, and the location of utilities both on and off-site. In such case, the

duly registered with the state of Ohio accompanied by a notarized statement of

   (A)   The terms of the surety shall provide that the village may retain or
claim the surety proceeds if the permit holder fails to perform the demolition
activities in accordance with the permit granted.
      (1)   In the event that the planned demolition is of such a size or scope
that the $5,000 bond, deposit or surety will be insufficient to assure
completion for the demolition and site restoration activity, the Village
Administrator may request a larger value performance bond, cash deposit, or
other surety to assure the village that the demolition work will proceed as
permitted, such larger value to be set on a case-by-case basis, upon majority
vote of Council.
      (2)   In any event, the value of the surety shall not exceed the cost
associated with the demolition and site restoration.
   (B)   Bonds must be approved as to form by the Village Solicitor,
indemnifying the Village for all liability arising by reason of the acts of the

the Zoning Administrator shall inspect the premises to determine whether such
use/construction conforms to all provisions of this Zoning Code and the
approved final development plan as applicable, or if it is a lawfully existing
nonconforming use.
   (D)   Action by Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator review the
application. In evaluating the application, the Zoning Administrator may
consult with any department, agency, public body, official, company, or
individual necessary to determine whether the application complies with the

the Zoning Administrator shall:
      (1)   Approve. The Zoning Administrator shall issue a Certificate Zoning
of Compliance upon finding that the building, structure or use, as proposed,
complies with the provisions of this Zoning Code, if the maintenance and
performance guarantees have been provided, as applicable.
      (2)   Denial. If it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that the
proposed building, structure or use would violate one or more provisions of
this Zoning Code, then the Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall not be
issued. Upon disapproval of any application, the Zoning Administrator shall
notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for disapproval.
      (3)   Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance. Pending the issuance of
a permanent Certificate of Zoning Compliance, a temporary certificate may be
issued, to be valid for a period not to exceed (6) six months from its date,
pending the completion of any required improvements, provided a performance
guarantee has been provided to the Village from a banking institution of
sufficient amount to cover the estimated cost of materials and labor and in a
form acceptable to the Village Solicitor.
   (E)   Construction Staking Field Verification and Certification.
      (1)   For all construction requiring a zoning permit, prior to the start

§ 150.635 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USES.
   Each zoning district established by this Zoning Code, and amendments
thereto, includes a list of uses of land or structures that are permitted in
the district because they are considered compatible with one another. To the
extent that new types of uses are created which have not been addressed by this
Zoning Code, this Section provides the procedure by which the Planning
Commission may make a determination that a new use is similar to a use
permitted in a district.
   (A)   Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use is in compliance with
the following provisions:
      (1)   The proposed use is not listed as a permitted use in any district
within the Village;
      (2)   The proposed use is not explicitly prohibited in any district or
the Zoning Code;
      (3)   The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the district in which it is proposed;
      (4)   The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district;
      (5)   Such proposed use does not create dangers to health and safety, and
does not create offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare or
other objectionable influences to an extent greater than normally resulting
from other uses listed in the district to which it is proposed; and
      (6)   Such proposed use does not create traffic to a greater extent than
the other uses listed in the district to which it is proposed.
   (B)   Assignment to Districts. If the Planning Commission approves the
proposed similar use, then the similar use shall be added to the appropriate
districts, as identified in the Planning Commission’s determination.

of approval or grants an extension to the above stated time frame for good
cause. If, at the end of that time, a final development plan has not been
submitted to the Zoning Administrator, then approval of the preliminary
development plan shall expire and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and
re-approved in accordance with this Article.
   (B)   Final Development Plan.
      (1)   If construction of any phase of the approved development plan
begins within one year after approval is granted, the approval shall be valid
until the development is completed; provided, however, if the performance of
the development plan is not substantially completed after the second year, the
development plan is void.
      (2)   If no construction has begun within one year after the approval is
granted, the site plan’s approval shall be void. An extension of time may be
approved at the sole discretion of the Village Planning Commission.
      (3)   For this purposes of this Section, construction is deemed to have
begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings of one or more
principal buildings included on the final development plan have been completed.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.663 EQUIVALENCY PROVISION.
   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission may find that a final
development plan either adheres to or is equivalent to the requirements of this
Zoning Code.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may consider elements of a final development
plan to be equivalent to a requirement if:
      (1)   The proposed final development plan substantially complies with all
specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic objectives of the
zoning district;
      (2)   Through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, as disclosed
by the application, the proposal results in a development of equivalent or
higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict application of
such standards and requirements; and
      (3)   The development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon the
surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the
community.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate to the
Planning Commission that the provisions of this Section have been satisfied.
When evaluating the application with respect to this Section, the Planning
Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in writing which explains how
and why the proposal has satisfied the above criteria. When making such a
finding, the Commission may approve the proposed application, including waivers
from the numerical standards herein, as if the application were in strict
compliance with the standards and requirements in this Zoning Code.
   (C)   Approval under this Section is not a variance. Instead, this Section
allows applicants to satisfy zoning requirements in ways not anticipated by the
Village.

§ 150.671 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional use permit is required
and the application for such conditional use permit shall be submitted and
reviewed according to the following review procedures.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.672 DESIGNATION AS A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (A)   Certain types of uses are classified as conditional uses because of
their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district. The
village has determined that such use may be permitted and desirable in certain
districts but not without consideration in each case of the effect of the use
upon neighboring land and the public need for a particular use at the
particular location. The application of the planning standards for determining
the location and extent of such use is a planning function and not in the
nature of a variance or appeal. Consequently, the conditional use procedures
call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for properly accommodating
such activities in the community.
   (B)   The purpose of this Article is to provide controllable and reasonably
flexible requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable
latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time, maintain adequate
provisions for the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the
Village’s inhabitants.
   (C)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, this chapter sets forth
a review procedure that enables a more detailed consideration of each
conditional use. The review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning
and land use in the vicinity of the proposed use; the design, size, operation,
processes and equipment employed, and intensity of the proposed use; the
impacts of the proposed use at the proposed location on the public health,
safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare, including traffic
generation and movement, the amount and kinds of public facilities and services
required; and whether and to what extent all appropriate feasible steps have
been taken by the permit applicant to minimize or mitigate any adverse impacts
of the proposed use.
   (D)   Review of this information by the Planning Commission is required to
ensure that each proposed conditional use is consistent with the intent and
objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.673 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator on a form prescribed by the village, accompanied by an
application fee as established by Village Council.
   (A)   The application for a conditional use permit shall include the
following items:
      (1)   A development plan and associated documentation as required in §
150.652.
      (2)   A description of all uses proposed for the development, the
location, extent and characteristics.
      (3)   A statement or diagram showing compliance with any use-specific
requirements specified in
Article 150.33.
      (4)   Any other material and/or information as may be required by the
Planning Commission to fulfill the purposes of this Article and to ensure that
the application is in compliance generally with the ordinances of Swanton.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator may waive certain submittal requirements in
order to reduce the burden on the petitioner and to tailor the requirements to
the information necessary to review a particular petition. The Zoning
Administrator may waive such requirements upon finding that the project size,
complexity, anticipated impacts, or other factors associated with the proposed
development clearly, in his or her opinion, support such waiver. Any such
waivers shall be authorized in writing and retained in the project file.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.674 PUBLIC HEARING AND REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   Application for such conditional use permits received from the
applicant shall be submitted by the Zoning Administrator to the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing thereon, notice of which
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation, or mailed to the
owners of property contiguous to and across the street from the parcel of which
a conditional use permit is requested at least 20 days before the hearing.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may require additional plans and documents
further clarifying the nature and extent of the use or any aspect of the
application.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.675 DECISION.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall take action upon such application within
45 days after the date of receiving said application; failure to act within
such period shall be deemed approval, unless an extension of this time is
agreed to by the applicant.
      (1)   Approval. The Planning Commission may approve or approve with
conditions the application for a conditional use permit.
      (2)   Denial. The Planning Commission may deny the application for a
conditional use permit. If the Planning Commission denies the application, the
application process ends. Disapproval of the application for a conditional use
permit shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial.
      (3)   Failure of the Planning Commission to act within the time, or an
extended period as may be agreed upon, shall at the election of the applicant
be deemed a denial of the application.
   (B)   All conditions imposed upon any conditional use approval, with the
exception of conditions made applicable to such approval by the terms of this
Zoning Code, shall be set forth expressly in the resolution granting the
conditional use permit.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.676 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following criteria. Furthermore,
the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each proposed use shall not approve the permit unless the following conditions
and standards are complied with as set forth for the following districts.
   (A)   Residential Districts and the Public/Open Space District.
      (1)   The proposed use shall be properly located in relation to the
Comprehensive Plan or other adopted land use plans for the area, particularly
to the secondary and local streets and pedestrian circulation;
      (2)   When located on a local street the proposed use will generate the
least possible traffic through a residential neighborhood and shall contain
vehicular approaches to the property, so designed as not to create interference
with traffic on surrounding public thoroughfares;
      (3)   The proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding residential
areas which cannot be served satisfactorily if the same use is located in a
nearby less restrictive district where it may be permitted by right;
      (4)   The location, design and operation of such use will not discourage
the appropriate development or impair the value of the surrounding residential
district;
      (5)   The proposed use will not create excessive additional requirements
at public cost for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community;
      (6)   The proposed use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that the use will
not change the essential character of the same area; and
      (7)   For temporary structures every conditional use permit shall be
reviewed every six months and may be renewed only while the construction
operations are pursued diligently.
   (B)   Business and Industrial Districts.
      (1)   The proposed use shall be necessary to serve the community needs
and existing similar facilities located in a less restrictive, or more remote
district in which the use may be permitted by right, are inadequate;
      (2)   The proposed use shall be no closer than appropriate in the
particular situation to schools, churches and other places of assembly;
      (3)   The location, extent and intensity of the proposed use shall be
such that its operation will not be objectionable to nearby dwellings by reason
of noise, smoke, dust, odors, fumes, vibrations or glare than is normal or is
permitted by the performance standards of the district;
      (4)   The proposed use may be permitted in a more restrictive district
than in which it is permitted by right only because of its limited extent,
modern equipment and processes;
      (5)   The hours of operation and concentration of vehicles in connection
with the proposed use will not be more hazardous or dangerous than the normal
traffic of the district;
      (6)   The proposed use will have vehicular approaches to the property
which shall be so designed as not to create an interference with traffic on
surrounding public thoroughfares;
      (7)   The proposed use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or
future neighboring uses; and
      (8)   The proposed use will not create excessive additional requirements
at public cost for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community.
   (C)   Electronic Message Center Signs.
      (1)   The location, extent and intensity of the proposed sign shall be
such that its operation will not be objectionable to nearby residential
dwellings by reason of light, glare, intensity or brilliance than is normal for
the standards of the zoning district;
      (2)   The proposed use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing
residential uses; impair the vision of the drivers of motor vehicles or
interfere with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal;
      (3)   All signs must be equipped with a means to immediately turn off the
display or lighting if it malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must
immediately turn off the sign when notified to do so by the village if a
malfunctioning sign does not turn off automatically;
      (4)   The Planning Commission may permit a larger pole or ground sign in
commercial zoning districts only, if the applicant agrees to consolidate
multiple or nonconforming signs into a single sign; but in no case can any sign
be greater than 150% of the size of a pole or ground sign permitted by right in
any commercial zoning district. The Planning Commission may also require
additional setbacks from rights-of-way, residential zoning districts or
property lines to accommodate larger signage.
   (D)   Safeguards and conditions. In addition to complying with the general
standards set forth in this section, conditions appropriate to each particular
application may also be set forth in the permit.

breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement shall constitute a violation
of this Zoning Code.

   (A)   The completed application form, along with the appropriate review fee;

(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.698 PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW OF VARIANCE REQUEST.
   (A)   Hearing and Notice. The Planning Commission shall schedule a hearing
to review the variance application and give notice of the same.
      (1)   Upon such application being filed, the Zoning Administrator shall
provide written notice to the owners of all properties directly contiguous to
the property for which the variance is requested; or be published for two
successive weeks prior thereto, in a newspaper of general circulation in the
village.
      (2)   Such notice shall be provided by first class mail or hand delivery,
at least ten (10) days before the date of the Planning Commission hearing at
which the variance will be considered. Such notice shall be mailed to the
address of such property owners appearing on the County Auditor’s current tax
list. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any
determination made by the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Factors for Review of Variance Application. The Planning Commission
shall review each application for a variance to determine if it complies with
the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and the evidence demonstrates that
the literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will result in practical difficulty
or unnecessary hardship, depending on the type of variance requested.
      (1)   Unnecessary Hardship for Use Variance. Where the literal
application of the provisions of this zoning code would result in unnecessary
hardships peculiar to the property involved, the Planning Commission may grant
a use variance in the application of the provisions of the Zoning Code only if
all of the following findings are made:
         (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Code in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
         (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed, further developed, or
used in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Code and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property.
         (c)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
         (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use of development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
         (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
      (2)   In determining practical difficulty, the Planning Commission shall
consider and weigh the following factors when determining whether the applicant
will experience practical difficulties:
         (a)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance.
         (b)   Whether the variance is substantial.
         (c)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
         (d)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
         (e)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction.
         (f)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance.
         (g)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall not grant a variance unless it shall,
in each case, make specific findings of fact directly based upon the particular
evidence presented to it from the factors above.
   (C)   Requests for Additional Information. The Planning Commission may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Planning
Commission deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 150.699 DECISION ON VARIANCE APPLICATION.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall take action upon such application within
45 days after the date of receiving said application. The Planning Commission
shall: approve; approve with supplementary conditions; or disapprove the
request.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may further prescribe any conditions and
safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the objectives of the
regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies will be met.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the application is granted, shall be deemed a violation punishable
under
Article 150.71, Enforcement and Penalties.
   (C)   If the Planning Commission fails to act within 45 days from the date
of receiving the application, or an extended period as may be agreed upon by
the Planning Commission and applicant, then the application shall be considered
denied.

interest.

§ 151.301 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to establish the procedures for Planning
Commission review and action on applications for major subdivisions as defined
by R.C. § 711.001 and elsewhere. The procedure is intended to provide orderly
and expeditious processing of such applications.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.302 PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing subdivision and site
plan design and development costs, the subdivider is encouraged to meet with
the Village Zoning Administrator and Village Engineer prior to submitting a
preliminary plat. This pre-application conference is an opportunity for the
subdivider, Zoning Administrator, Village Engineer and other village officials
to informally discuss the purpose and effect of these regulations, the criteria
and standards contained herein; and to familiarize the developer with the
Village’s future land use plan, Zoning Code and Flood Damage Reduction Code,
and the drainage, sewerage and water systems for the village. It also provides
the Zoning Administrator and Village Engineer an opportunity to review the plan
and give recommendations to address some of the issues that otherwise would
become stipulations or comments in the preliminary plan stage.
   (A)   This step does not require a formal application, fee, or filing of the
plan.
   (B)   This step does not constitute formal acceptance of the subdivision
application. The official acceptance date of the subdivision application shall
be the date the Zoning Administrator accepts the preliminary plan of the
subdivision for consideration at a meeting.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.303 CONCEPT PLAN.
   (A)   In addition or as an alternative to the pre-application conference, at
the request of the applicant, the Planning Commission shall grant an informal
review of a concept plan for a development for which the applicant intends to
prepare and submit an application for development. The purpose of the concept
plan is for the Planning Commission to provide input in the formative stages of
subdivision and site plan design.
   (B)   Applicants seeking informal review of a concept plan shall submit a
sketch plan of the proposed subdivision containing the items specified in §
151.314.
   (C)   The applicant shall not be bound by any concept plan for which review
is requested, nor shall the Planning Commission be bound by any such review.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)

centerline of a proposed new highway or a highway for which changes are
proposed as described in the certification to local officials by the State
Highway Director of any land within a radius of 500 feet from the point of
intersection of said centerline with any public road or highway, the Commission
shall give notice, by registered or certified mail to the Highway Director. The
Commission shall not approve the plat for 120 days from the date the notice is
received by the Highway Director. If the Highway Director notifies the
Commission that he or she shall proceed to acquire the land needed, then the
Commission shall refuse to approve the plat. If the Highway Director notifies
the Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest or
upon the expiration of the 120-day period or any extension thereof agreed upon
by the Highway Director and the property owner, the Commission shall, if the
plat is in conformance with all provisions of these regulations, approve the
plat.

that the terms under which the approval was granted will not be affected by
changes to these regulations.
   (E)   The approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of
12 months unless, upon application of the subdivider, the Planning Commission

§ 151.501 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to establish standards for subdivision layout
and improvements design that will create functional and attractive
developments, minimize adverse impacts and ensure that proposed subdivisions
will be an asset to the village. To promote this purpose, the subdivision shall
conform to the following standards, which are designed to result in a well
planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.502 SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing
local and regional plans for the municipality and the surrounding community.
   (B)   To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to
preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental
sensitivity, to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features
and to preserve historically significant structures and sites.
   (C)   Development shall be designed to avoid construction on steep slopes in
excess of 20% as measured over a ten-foot interval unless appropriate
engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion and resident safety
are taken into consideration.
   (D)   The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting ground
water and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to avoid unnecessary
impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and
sites; and to mitigate adverse effects for shadow, noise, odor, traffic,
drainage and utilities on neighboring properties.
   (E)   Variations, exceptions and/or modifications of these regulations may
be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases where it is deemed that
unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modification
or adjustment of these regulations, or for special developments of rental units
or new concepts of solar orientation or other methods of platting, provided
that such plats are self-contained and do not encroach unfavorably on or
interfere with the normal development of abutting properties.
   (F)   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided
is unsuitable for development due to flooding, inadequate drainage, topography,
inadequate water supply, inadequate sanitary sewage disposal, schools,
transportation facilities or other such conditions which may endanger health,
life or property; and if from investigations conducted by various public
agencies concerned, it is determined that in the best interest of the public,
the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning
Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.503 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ENCOURAGED.
   The planned residential development (PRD) approach to development is
encouraged by the Planning Commission through use of the Planned Residential
Development (PRD) Overlay set forth in
Article 150.23 of the Zoning Code. These subdivision and site construction
regulations may be modified by the degree necessary to accomplish the
objectives and standards required by the planned development of a PRD
residential subdivision, in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code.
Nothing within this section, however, shall exempt the developer from the
requirements of subdivision plat approval as specified in
Article 151.30 Major Subdivision Procedures of these regulations. All planned
residential developments are subject to approval by the Planning Commission and
Village Council.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.504 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Blocks shall be designed to accommodate lots of a size and character
required for the zoning district in which the development is located and to
provide convenient circulation, service and safety on boundary streets. The
blocks shall be designed so that the rear lot lines shall coincide with
drainage courses, railroads and divisions in land uses.
   (B)   The maximum length of blocks shall be 1,320 feet. The Planning
Commission may require a crosswalk at approximately the center of the block in
blocks that exceed 900 feet in length.
   (C)   The width of blocks shall be sufficient to provide for an ultimate
development of two tiers of lots between streets and eliminate double frontage
lots. A single tier of lots, having a greater depth than the required minimum,
may be required to separate residential development from major or arterial
streets, adjoining nonresidential land uses, or unusual topographic or natural
features. An easement of at least ten feet in width for screening, which shall
not be traversed by vehicles, may be required along the lots abutting such a
major or arterial street or nonresidential land use.
   (D)   Where all or part of a subdivision is adjacent to or in the vicinity
of a primary or secondary street, the greater dimension of blocks shall
generally parallel the primary or secondary streets to avoid unnecessary
ingress and egress.
   (E)   Blocks for multi-family residential, commercial or industrial uses
shall be adequate to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards,
service drives, off-street parking and other required facilities.

regulations and the zoning requirements for the district in which it is located
and the use for which it is intended.
   (C)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines, except where the Planning Commission
determines that a variation to this rule provides a better street and lot
layout.
   (D)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Planning
Commission determines that double frontage lots are essential to provide
separation of residential development from arterial streets or nonresidential
land uses, as provided in §
151.504(C) of these regulations.
   (E)   Corner residential lots shall have extra width sufficient to maintain
building lines on both streets, as required by the Zoning Code.

§ 151.506 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT LOT DESIGN.
   (A)   A commercial subdivision may show lots which need not conform to any
minimum width or area, except those required in the zoning ordinance, but such
subdivisions shall show the location within which buildings may be erected and
the area that is to be reserved for off-street parking and service areas.
   (B)   The location for vehicular movements between the subdivision and
adjacent streets shall be indicated, and restrictions shall be recorded upon
the plat which will restrict such vehicular movement to the location shown on
the plat.
   (C)   Easements may be required providing for vehicular movements through
parking areas and to and from service areas, as well as easements which can be
improved as buffer areas wherever the area adjoins property zoned for
residential use. The installation of plantings, walls, fences or other
improvements that will assure a satisfactory buffer or protective screen within
such easement may be required.

§ 151.507 PUBLIC OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION.
   (A)   Where the subdivision contains a street, park, school or other public
area which is shown upon the future land use plan as intended for public
ownership, all or part of such area shall either be dedicated to the proper
public agency or it shall be reserved for acquisition, within a specified
period by purchase or other means and an agreement shall be entered into
between the subdivider and the proper public agency regarding the time and
method of acquisition and the cost thereof, or an agreement shall be made by
the appropriate public agency upon an alternate location that is satisfactory
to the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding natural
and cultural features such as scenic spots, watercourses, historic sites and
substantial stands of trees.

extension of an existing street, the name should remain the same. Street names
shall be subject to the approval of the Village Planning Commission or Village
Administrator with review and recommendations from other governmental agencies
such as law enforcement and emergency response departments.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 151.510 CIRCULATION SYSTEM DESIGN.
   (A)   The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and
orderly movement of traffic to meet, but not exceed, the needs of the present
or future population to be served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to
respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive
streetscape.
   (B)   In residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed to
serve the needs of the neighborhood and to discourage use by through traffic.
      (1)   Public Streets. Publicly dedicated streets shall be required for
the following:
         (a)   For access to all sublots within the residential subdivision
that are designed as a part of a standard detached single-family subdivision.

walks shall be placed parallel to and along both sides of all streets, with
exceptions permitted to preserve natural features or to provide visual
interest. In planned unit developments, walks may be placed away from the road
system, but they may also be required parallel to the street for safety
reasons.
   (D)   Bikeways, greenways, hiking trails or other alternative pedestrian
linkages should be provided where a connection to an existing system is readily
available.
   (E)   New streets shall be a continuation of existing streets or provide a
minimum jog of 120 feet from the existing street alignment.
   (F)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets, or stub streets, shall be permitted only as part of a continuing
street plan, and only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Planning
Commission in design is provided and provisions for maintenance, removal and

   (R)   Applicants are encouraged to implement low-impact development (LID)
best practices to integrate hydrologically functional design with pollution
prevention measures to compensate for land development impacts on hydrology and
water quality. LID’s goal is to mimic natural hydrology and processes by using
small-scale, decentralized practices that infiltrate, evaporate, detain, and
transpire stormwater. LID stormwater control measures (SCMs) should be
uniformly and strategically located throughout the site, and should be designed
in conjunction with green infrastructure opportunities for accessory parking
areas.

been completed; or
      (2)   The subdivider has filed with the Village Administrator a
performance guarantee in the form of a bond, certified check or irrevocable
letter of credit equal to estimated cost of construction of the improvements,
as determined by a professional engineer licensed in the state, plus 10% of the
required improvements; guaranteeing to the village the completion of such
improvements in a satisfactory manner within such time, not to exceed two
years, as may be fixed by the Planning Commission. The form of bond, check or
letter of credit shall be approved by the Village Solicitor or other authorized
legal representative, and shall be made payable to and enforceable by the
village.
   (C)   Upon application of the subdivider, the Planning Commission may waive
compliance with division (B) above upon the following conditions:
      (1)   After the preliminary plat drawing of the proposed subdivision has
been approved by the Village Planning Commission, the subdivider may improve a
portion of the proposed subdivision and submit a final plat for that improved
portion to the Village Planning Commission for approval. If the Planning
Commission deems it necessary to defer the construction of any required
improvement, the subdivider shall pay his or her share of the costs of the
deferred future improvements, as determined by the village, to the village
prior to the approval of the final plat by the village. The subdivider shall
provide a surety bond, certified check or irrevocable letter of credit equal to
the estimated cost of the construction of the improvements as determined by a
professional engineer licensed in the state plus 10% of the remaining required
improvements, guaranteeing to the village the completion of such improvements

improvements according to the terms and conditions of divisions (B)(2) and (C)
(1) above, the village, upon proceed to have such work completed and
appropriate such portion of bond, certified check or irrevocable letter of
credit posted for the faithful performance of said work.
   (E)   Inspections during installation of improvements shall be made by the
village to ensure conformity with the approved technical design and
construction plans and other specifications. The subdivider shall be liable for
costs incurred for necessary inspections during construction. An amount
covering the estimated costs of such inspections shall be deposited with the
Village Administrator prior to commencing the work. The subdivider shall notify
the proper administrative officials 24 hours prior to commencing work.
   (F)   Upon completion of all required improvements, the developer shall
notify the Village Administrator, in writing, of the completion of improvements
and request a final inspection. The village, its consulting engineer or other
authorized representatives shall inspect all improvements of which such notice
has been given and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the Village
Administrator listing items of work necessary to accomplish satisfactory
completion of the improvements; and/or recommending acceptance of the
improvements. The Village Administrator shall notify the developer in writing,
by certified mail, of the contents of the inspection report no later than 45
days after receipt of the notice of completion from the developer.

   Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. This chapter adopts
regulations for areas of special flood hazard that are necessary for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore, the Council
of the Village of Swanton does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 152.102 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 152.103 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 152.104 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.

flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.

Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation plus one foot of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A

analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters; high potential
for debris and projectile impacts and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.

engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories.
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. As defined in the Village Zoning Code.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As defined in the Village Zoning Code.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against
losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance
alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the
NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal
government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Swanton Flood
Insurance Rate Map, February 15, 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   PERSON. As defined in the Village Zoning Code.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. As defined in the Village Zoning Code.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of this chapter consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.

   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the village’s flood
maps, studies and other data identified in §
152.106 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified.
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

elevation; and
         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(1)
above.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Council of the village or its
designee, and may be submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon the occurrence of annexation or
detachment, the Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever
the boundaries of the village have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the village’s flood insurance rate map to accurately represent the its
boundaries, notification shall include a copy of the map of the village
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the village has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.

§ 152.311 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard.
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this chapter; and
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
152.701 through
152.706, Appeals and Variances.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks and the like) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2023-03, passed 2-27-2023)
§ 152.312 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire and the like. After such a damage event,
the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures with materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 152.509 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in this
chapter, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
152.310(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Council of the village or designee and the
legislative authority or designee of any other communities impacted by the
proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         (b)   Divisions (A)(2), (A)(2)(a), (A)(2)(c), (A)(2)(d) and (A)(2)(e)
above.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of this chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage”. The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply.
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
152.310(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 152.704 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Planning Commission shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee as set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Swanton.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Planning Commission shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation, or mailed to
the owners of property contiguous to and across the street from the parcel of
which a variance is requested at least 20 days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Planning Commission requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Planning Commission shall consider and make findings of fact
on all evaluations, relevant factors and standards specified in other sections
of this chapter as well as the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. In
increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this
chapter, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (0.5) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in division (C)(1)(a)
through (C)(1)(k) above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half (0.5) acre, the technical justification required for issuing
the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
