codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
 
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane

   SECTION II. That the provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance,
except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor.

or affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified Ordinances as
reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as otherwise
indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Waverly, in the County of Pike and the State

adopt this Charter for the government of the City of Waverly.
Article I
NAME AND BOUNDARIES
   The municipal corporation now existing and known as the City of Waverly,
Ohio, hereinafter in this Charter called the "City", shall be and continue to a

and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the manner authorized by the
laws of Ohio.
   The term "City" as used in this Charter shall be construed to mean the
Municipality of Waverly, which was originally incorporated as a village and
which subsequently became a city pursuant to the Constitution and laws of Ohio.
Article II
MUNICIPAL POWERS
   The City shall have all powers of local self-government now and hereafter
granted to municipalities by the Constitution of the State of Ohio and such
further powers as are now or hereafter may be granted by the laws of the State
of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this
Charter or, if not prescribed herein, in such lawful manner as the Council
shall determine by ordinance or resolution; enumeration of or reference to
particular powers in this Charter shall not be construed to be exclusive.
Article III
THE COUNCIL
SECTION III-1.00 NUMBER, ELECTION AND TERM.
   The legislative powers of the City, except as otherwise provided by this

SECTION III-3.00 DISTRICTING OF CITY INTO WARDS.
   A.    For the purpose of dividing the City into wards as required in

are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

163.04  PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Village of Waverly that openness leads to a better
informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy.
It is the policy of the Village of Waverly to strictly adhere to the state’s
Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their
narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request
must be accompanied by an explanation, including the legal authority, as
outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
   (a)   Public Records. The Village of Waverly, in accordance with the Ohio
Revised Code, defines records as including the following: any document- paper,
electronic (including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format-that is
created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that
documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the office. All records of the Village of
Waverly are public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)   It is the policy of the Village of Waverly that, as required by
Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying. (See Section 4 for the e-mail record
policy). Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and are
available in the office of the records commissioner.
   (b)   Record Requests. Each request for public records shall be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office’s general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
      (3)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
      (4)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. The acknowledgment of the request must include
the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
      (5)   Any denial of public records requested and must include an
explanation, including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and
portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest
released. If there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a
supporting explanation, including legal authority.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records. Those seeking public records will be charged
only the actual cost of making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is 15 cents per page.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1.00
per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (d)   E-Mail. Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by
the Ohio Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office.
E-mail is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and
should follow the same retention schedules.
      (1)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office
are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see
Section 1 Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts
and/or to the office’s records custodian.
      (2)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

171.02   Community Service Program.

property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated;
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         ii.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,

Code;

and services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation
to gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from

another basis may be substituted, under uniform regulations, so as to produce
an equitable result.

wages,
commissions and other compensation, and with respect to the net profits of
businesses, professions or other activities earned from December I, 1994,
provided, however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or
other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that
part of the net profits for the fiscal year as shall be earned on and after
December 1, 1994, the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the
taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
185.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   A.   All residents except as herein provided shall, whether or not a tax is
due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15th of the year
following the effective date of this ordinance, and each year thereafter in
compliance with Ohio Revised Code§ 718.05(B). When the return is made for a
fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the returns shall
be filed within four (4) months from the end of the fiscal year.
   B.   The Village of Waverly shall accept a generic form of any return,
report, or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and
filed, contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Village of Waverly's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the
taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic forms otherwise complies with
the rules or ordinances of the Village of Waverly governing the filing of
returns, reports or documents. The return shall be filed with the Administrator
setting forth:
      1.   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned, including gambling winnings, and gross income from
business, profession, or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in
the acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and

      2.    The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits;
      3.    Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Administrator may require.
   C.    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request by filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a
federal filing extension with the Administrator. The request for extension
shall be filed not later than the last day for filing the municipal income tax
return as prescribed by ordinance of the Village of Waverly. The Administrator
shall grant such a request for extension filed before January I, 2004, for a
period not less than the period of the federal extension request. The IRS
authorizes four (4) months automatically and additional requests are limited to
six (6) months from the original due date. For taxable years beginning after
2003, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended. The Administrator may require a tentative
return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by
the date the return is normally due. No penalty or interest shall be assessed
in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the
period as extended. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Commissioner.
      1.   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last day
for filing the Village of Waverly tax return as prescribed by ordinance or rule

         (b)    Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request;
         (c)    Owes the Village of Waverly any delinquent income tax or any
penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax; or
         (d)    Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
   The granting of an extension for filing a municipal corporation income tax
return does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless
the municipal corporation grants an extension of that date.
   D.    1.    The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
185.06 , or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
185.07 , or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
185.15 , hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      2.    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
of Waverly is entitled under the provisions of this ordinance may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar
($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   E.    1.   AMENDED RETURNS: Where necessary, an amended return must be filed
in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a
refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations
contained in Sections
185.11  and
185.15 . Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date from filing the original
return.
      2.    Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Waverly tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Waverly return showing
income subject to the Village of Waverly tax based upon such final
determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due
thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
185.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   A.    In accordance with Rules and Regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the Village of
Waverly shall deduct at the time for the payment of such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%) of the gross
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by the said employer to
said employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter make a return and pay to the Administrator the
amount of taxes deducted. Said returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed
by and obtainable from the Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and
Regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator. Such employer shall be
liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether
or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   B.    Such employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Village of Waverly, as a Trustee
for the benefit of the Village of Waverly and any such tax collected by such
employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village of
Waverly, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   C.    Each employer, on or before the 28th day of February following any
calendar year in which such deductions have been made by any employer, shall
file with the Administrator an information return for each employee from whom
the Village of Waverly Income Tax has been withheld, showing the name and
address of the employee, the whole amount of compensation paid said employee
during the year and the amount of Village of Waverly Income Tax withheld from
each employee.
   D.    For taxable years beginning after 2003, the Village of Waverly shall
not require any employer or any agent of any employer or any other payer, to
withhold tax with respect to any amount other than qualifying wages. Nothing in
this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than
qualifying wages.
   E.    An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   F.    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by failure of the
employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal corporation or by the
employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
   G.    The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation the
tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   H.    Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.

         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this Chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
186.091  of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
(Ord. 72-2017. Passed 12-19-17.)

      (6)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary

      (7)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
186.051  of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
Chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
186.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
186.051  of this Chapter.
   (G)    INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino

      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
186.07  of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

186.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
186.03 (23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
186.03 (1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
186.03 (11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

profession in Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (A)(2) and (B) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 186.052;
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect
to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by this chapter.
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by this chapter.
         (d)    Nothing in division (A)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (A)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (A)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (A)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (B) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Municipality
if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within Municipality
to purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer is not,
through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion
of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Municipality based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of Municipality shall report
the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a credit for
taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation
to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the Municipality's income tax
ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (A)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
   (B)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
186.052 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (B)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (A)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying, remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
186.052 of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 78-2023. Passed 12-20-23.)

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
               (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
718.80 of the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
               (5)    When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised
Code is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised
Code is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period. (Ord. 21-2018. Passed 4-17-18.)
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
186.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
186.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
186.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
186.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
186.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
186.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

    The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

retention in the Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it
shall be measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the Municipality
derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
186.091  of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, for an individual, on or
before the fifteenth day of the first month of the following taxable year,
ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
186.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
186.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
186.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 72-2017. Passed 12-19-17.)
186.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
186.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPAL CORPORATION.
   (A)    When an individual domiciled in the Municipality is subject to
Municipal Income Tax in one or more other municipal corporations, he or she
shall not pay a total municipal income tax to the Municipality on the same
income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who is domiciled in the Municipality and who
receives Municipal Taxable Income for work done or services performed or
rendered outside the Municipality, if such individual has paid a municipal
income tax on the same income taxable under this Chapter to one or more other
municipal corporations, such individual shall be allowed a full credit against
the tax imposed by this Chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf
to such other municipal corporation(s) up to the amount of Municipal Income Tax
levied by the Municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by
this Chapter on such income earned in such other municipal corporation(s) where
such tax is paid.
   (C)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may provide by Municipality regulations.
   (D)   In no situation or circumstance will an income tax paid to a county,
school district, township, or other political subdivision of Ohio or of another
state other than an income tax levied and collected by one or more municipal
corporations be eligible for a credit or offset for an individual taxpayer
subject to the Municipal Income Tax of the Municipality under this Chapter.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
186.081  of this Chapter.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
186.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
186.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section

186.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
186.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact

agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with
any provision in Section
186.092 of this Chapter, the provisions in Section
186.092 of this Chapter prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
186.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
186.052  of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

186.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the

Section
186.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
186.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

186.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
186.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark

ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on

a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer

taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

186.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

186.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
186.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
186.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
186.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
186.99  of this Chapter for a violation of Section
186.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
   (C)    Any person divulging such information in violation of this Chapter,
shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a first degree misdemeanor
and shall be subject to a fine or penalty of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both. Each
disclosure shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to this penalty,
any employee of the Municipality who violates this section relative to the
disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable
by immediate dismissal.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)

   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
186.15 .
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,

      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has

involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 12-15-15.)
186.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.

authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.

of that assessment.

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
186.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that

section, a violation of subsection (b) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (4)    A violation of subsection (b) of this section is a felony and

storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three

residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model and color, the location from which it was
removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other

to 4513.65.

agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with Section
303.082.

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;

owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a

items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC

   For the purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any motor

   (b)   Extensively damaged, such damage including but not limited to any of
the following: missing wheels, tires, motor or transmission;
   (c)   Apparently inoperable;

of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12 or
regulated under the authority of the City; or if the property on which the
motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
   Any person owning an unlicensed collector’s vehicle and storing such vehicle
on private property with the permission of the person having the right to the
possession of the property shall conceal, by means of buildings, such vehicle.
   The Chief of Police is hereby authorized to send notice, by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of

housed in a garage or other suitable structure, or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first
offense; on a second offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree; on each subsequent offense such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

may damage or injure any person, vehicle or animal traveling along or upon such
street, except such substances that may be placed upon the roadway by proper
authority for the repair or construction thereof.
   (b)   Any person who drops or permits to be dropped or thrown upon any
street any noxious, destructive or injurious material shall immediately remove
the same.
   (c)   Any person authorized to remove a wrecked or damaged vehicle from a

alley any tacks, bottles, wire, glass, nails or other articles which may damage
or injure any person, vehicle or animal traveling along or upon such highway,
except such substances that may be placed upon the roadway by proper authority
for the repair or construction thereof.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates any provision of subsections (a) to (d) of this section is guilty of a

(ORC 4511.74)
311.02 PARADES AND ASSEMBLAGES.
   (a)   No person, group of persons or organization shall conduct or
participate in any parade, assemblage or procession other than a funeral
procession upon any street or highway, or block off any street or highway area,
without first obtaining a permit from the Police Chief.
   Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms as may be
prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.
   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
      (6)   An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.
   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the place of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
311.04 OBSTRUCTION OF SIDEWALKS, STREETS, OR PUBLIC PLACES.
   (a)   Definitions. The terms used in this section shall have the following
meanings. Where a term in the section is not specifically defined, the ordinary
dictionary meaning of the words used shall be applied.
      (1)   “Sidewalk” as used herein includes any walk, whether made or
constructed wholly or in part of stone, brick, gravel or earth covered with
tanbark, sawdust, ashes, cinders or other materials, or the earth alone, so
that the same is now or hereafter may be set apart and treated as a sidewalk,
as distinguishable from the street proper.
      (2)   “Street” as used herein means the entire width between the boundary
lines of every way open to the use of the public as a thoroughfare for purposes
of vehicular travel.
      (3)   “Public place” as used herein means any area of property, either
publicly owned or to which the public has access. The term shall specifically
include, but not be limited to, a street, sidewalk, alley, park, playground,
parking lot or garage, the doorway or entrance to any building that fronts such
a location, and a motor vehicle that is parked or idling in such a location.
      (4)   “Recklessness” means a conduct whereby the actor does not desire
harmful consequence but nonetheless foresees the possibility and consciously
takes the risk. Recklessness involves a greater degree of fault than negligence
but a lesser degree of fault than intentional wrongdoing. The state of mind in
which a person does not care about the consequences of his or her actions. See
Recklessness, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).
   (b)   No person shall recklessly sit, stand, or lay on any sidewalk, street
or public place in a manner so as to block or obstruct the free passage of
pedestrians or vehicles in the lawful use of sidewalks, streets or public
places.
   (c)   No person shall recklessly sit, lay, or stand on any sidewalk, street
or public place that is within twenty-five feet (25) of the place of entry to
any business, agency or governmental office during the operating hours of the
entity, in such a manner as to impede or obstruct the ability of the public to
enter or leave the business, agency or office.
   (d)   Penalty. Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing
sidewalks, streets or public places, a minor misdemeanor. If any offender has
previously been convicted under this section, or refuses to move after being
cited under this section, violation of this section is a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree.
   (e)   (1)   It is the intent of the Village of Waverly Council that this
section be narrowly construed so as to protect the health, safety and welfare
of the people, agencies, and businesses in the Village of Waverly, while
complying with State and Federal Constitutional standards.
      (2)   If any provision, paragraph, word or subsection of this section is
invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions,
paragraphs, words, sections or subsections shall not be affected and shall
remain in full force and effect.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.

      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.

Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that

   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.

the following:
         A.   A spouse;
         B.   A child or stepchild;

         F.   A son or daughter of the probationary license holder’s stepparent
if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or
vehicle registration.
335.032 USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE PROHIBITED WHILE
DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:
      (1)   A person using an electronic wireless communications device for
emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $ 5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
 
   (c)   Upon the motion of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to
a misdemeanor, the court may in its discretion require that person to perform
supervised community service work under authority of the City in lieu of
imprisonment or the payment of a fine or the payment of court costs or any
combination thereof. The following do not control the court’s discretion, but
shall be considered in favor of allowing an offender to perform supervised
community service work in lieu of imprisonment or the payment of a fine:
      (1)   The offense did not cause property damage or personal injury to
others.
      (2)   The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.
      (3)   The offender has no history of prior delinquency or criminal
activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period before
commission of the present offense.
      (4)   The character and attitude of the offender indicate that he is
unlikely to commit another offense.
      (5)   Imprisonment of the offender will entail undue hardship to himself
or his dependents.
   Supervised community service work under this section shall not be considered
a suspension of sentence.

   (d)    The Mayor may recommend to Council the removal of any member of the

of the Board from office by an affirmative vote of at least three quarters of
the Council only after having first given to such member a written copy of the
charges against him and an opportunity to be publicly heard in person or by
counsel in his defense. Any such removal shall be final.
   (e)    Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
conducting the business thereof. A vacancy on the Board shall not impair the
right of the other members to exercise all the power of the Board.
   (f)    Each member of the Board shall serve without salary, but shall be

Board.
   (g)    The Board is charged with the following duties to implement the
stated policy of this chapter:

practices which are filed with it;

      (6)    To do such other acts that are necessary and proper in order to
perform those duties with which it is charged under the terms of this chapter.
   (h)    The Mayor shall be responsible for the administration of this
chapter.
(Ord. 1-79. Passed 5-7-79.)
515.04 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the person
aggrieved; the name and address of the dwelling, which involves the alleged
discriminatory housing practice or employment practice; a concise statement of
the facts, including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged discriminatory
housing or employment practice, and such other information as may be required
by the Board. The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended. The Board may
also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by
its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.
Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Human Rights Board. If the Secretary shall
determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute
admission by any parties that the law has been violated. Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matters before the Board.
   (e)    If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the Secretary with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is
not susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board
shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of
this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing
shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen
calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the counsel, in
executive session, state its finding to and call the legal counsel to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that the
person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following service
of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify the
matter to the City legal counsel for enforcement. The City legal counsel shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human
Rights Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record, that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 1-79. Passed 5-7-79.)
515.05 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all employment, public
accommodations and housing located within the territorial limits of the City.
(Ord. 1-79. Passed 5-7-79.)
515.06 SEVERABILITY.
   The sections and subsections of this chapter and the several parts and
provisions hereof are hereby declared to be independent sections, subsections,
parts and provisions and the holding of any such section, subsection, parts or
provisions thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause,
shall not affect nor render invalid any other section, subsection, part or
provision thereof.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

Exhibit A   Assessment Rates.
Exhibit B    Payback Period Schedule.
Exhibit C   Criteria and Procedure for Granting Deferments or Waivers from
Special Assessments.
 
CROSS REFERENCES
Assessments generally - see Ohio R.C. Chapter 727
 
931.01  PURPOSE.
   This chapter sets forth policies for levying assessments on specific
property owners to cover, or partially cover, the cost of benefits bestowed on
the property by public improvements to elements of the infrastructure of the
City. It provides policies which will determine what properties will be
assessed and at what rate and amounts only in those instances where City
Council has decided to levy special assessments to finance a given capital
improvement project.
(Ord. 33-99. Passed 9-7-99.)
931.02  APPLICABILITY.
   The following policies shall be applicable in all sections of the City. For
certain identified capital improvement projects, the application of these
policies may be modified subject to the approval of City Council. The City may
accept petitions submitted by property owners to undertake a capital
improvement project prior to its scheduled implementation date provided,
however, that such property owner(s) agree to pay one hundred percent ( 100%)
of the cost of the proposed improvement.
(Ord. 33-99. Passed 9-7-99.)
931.03 ASSESSMENTS FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
   (a)    Sanitary Sewer.
      (1)    Property assessed. All properties receiving direct benefit.
      (2)    Assessment calculation. Special assessment charge shall be
comprised of a front footage assessment. The front footage assessment shall be
calculated by multiplying the benefitting front footage by a fixed assessment
rate. The maximum front footage assessed shall be the actual front footage per
benefitting parcel in all zoning districts. In the case of a corner lot in a
residential zoning district, the front foot assessment shall be based on the
entire front footage of the property less a credit of sixty percent (60%) for
any sanitary sewer improvements along the "long side" of the property.
      (3)    Assessment rates. Refer to Exhibit A of this chapter, for actual
assessment rates.
Assessment rates shall be adopted by resolution of City Council. The assessment
rates shall be established such that an abutting property, whether residential,
commercial or industrial, pays the cost of a sanitary sewer project. The actual
billing rate shall be based on the improvement costs for each project. At the
recommendation of the City Engineer, and subject to the approval of City
Council, a special "tap-in" district may be established to facilitate the
extension of sanitary sewer lines to selected unserviced areas of the
community. Within such a district, the City may pay for the initial cost of any
required line extensions if such lines are extended across properties which do
not require sanitary sewer service at present. Such properties shall be exempt
from paying for the cost of these line extensions until they are ready to
connect into the sewer system. At the time such properties are ready to connect
to the system, they shall pay a tap fee which shall equal the pro-rated, on an
acreage basis, cost of the basic system installation, including any oversizing
costs which may apply. (Refer to subsection (a)(5) hereof "Oversizing".)
      (4)    Payback. Sanitary sewer assessment for properties not exempted
from paying an up-front assessment may be paid back in accordance with the
payback schedule set forth in Exhibit B at the end of this chapter. For
properties exempted from paying an up-front fee, cost shall be paid at the time
of connection either in a lump sum or pro-rated over a maximum five (5) year
period.
      (5)    Oversizing. Oversizing of lines, necessary for the handling of
future increased development, shall be paid by the property owner(s) pro-rated
on a per acre basis. The oversizing charge shall be included in the assessment
at the time the property is assessed. The City shall, however, pay for the
initial cost of any required City initiated oversize line extension if such
lines are extended across properties within the same benefitted district which
do not require sanitary sewer service at present. Such properties shall be
exempt from paying for the oversized cost of these line extensions until they
are ready to connect into the sewer system. At the time that such properties
are ready to connect to the system, they shall pay an oversizing fee which
shall equal the pro-rated, on an acreage basis, cost of oversizing the lines.
The required oversizing fee shall be paid at the time of connection either in a
lump sum or pro- rated over a maximum five (5) year period.
   (b)    Water.
      (1)    Property assessed. All properties receiving direct benefit.
      (2)    Assessment calculation. Special assessment charges shall be
comprised of a frontage assessment. The front footage assessment shall be
calculated by multiplying the benefitting front footage by a fixed assessment
rate. In the case of a corner lot in a residential zoning district, the front
footage assessment shall be based on the entire front footage of the property
less a credit of sixty percent (60%) for water service improvements along the
"long side" of the property.
Property owners desiring a larger size lateral water service connection may
request same and pay the difference in cost between the standard three-fourths
(3/4) inch service connection and the selected size.
      (3)    Assessment rates. Assessment rates shall be adopted by resolution
of City Council. Front footage assessment rates shall be established such that
abutting property (whether residential, commercial or industrial) pay the cost
of the water main installation. Request for any desired oversizing, refer to
subsection (b)(5) hereof, “Oversizing”. The actual billing rate shall be based
on the improvement costs for each project.
   At the recommendation of the City Engineer and subject to the approval of
City Council, a special "tap-in" district may be established to facilitate the
extension of water lines to selected unserviced areas of the community. Within
such a district, the City may pay for the initial cost of any required line
extensions if such lines are extended across properties which do not require
potable water service at present. Such properties shall be exempt from paying
for the cost of these line extensions until they are ready to connect into the
water system. At the time such properties are ready to connect to the system,
they shall pay a tap fee which shall equal the pro-rated, on an acreage basis,
cost of the basic system installation, including any oversizing costs which may
apply.
      (4)    Payback. Water service assessment for properties so exempted from
paying for up-front assessment may be paid back in accordance with payback
schedule set forth in Exhibit B at the end of this chapter. For properties
exempted from paying an up-front assessment, the required tap fee shall be paid
at the time of connection either in a lump sum or pro-rated over a maximum five
(5) year period.
      (5)    Oversizing. Oversizing of lines required to provide, present and
future, shall be paid by the property owner(s) pro-rated on a demand basis. The
oversizing charge shall be included in the assessment at the time the property
is assessed. The City shall, however, pay for the initial cost of any required
City initiated oversize line extensions if such lines are extended across
properties lying within 500 feet of the water line extension which do not
require water service at present. Such properties shall be exempt from paying
for the oversizing cost of these line extensions until they are ready to
connect into the water system. At the time such properties are ready to connect
to the system, they shall pay an oversizing fee which shall equal the pro-
rated, on a demand basis, cost at the time of connection either in a lump sum
or pro-rated over a maximum five (5) year period.
   (c)    Sidewalks and Driveway Aprons.
      (1)    Property assessed. All properties receiving direct benefit shall
be assessed.
      (2)    Assessment calculation. Special assessment for sidewalk and apron
improvements shall be comprised of a front footage of the benefitting parcel
which requires sidewalk installation or replacement. The front footage
assessment shall be calculated by multiplying the total square footage by a
fixed assessment rate.
   All construction of sidewalks and aprons will be done to standards approved
by the City Engineer.
      (3)    Assessment rates. Assessment rates shall be adopted by resolution
of City Council. The assessment rates are set forth in Exhibit A.
      (4)    Payback. If the project is done at the City’s instance, the
property owner shall repay the City for sidewalk and apron repair improvements
within 5 years at 6% interest, secured by a promissory note and mortgage to the
City; if the project is commenced at the property owner’s request, the property
owner shall pay their share prior to beginning the project.
         (Ord. 06-2001. Passed 5-1-01.)
      (5)    Oversizing. If sidewalks larger than the standard width set by the
City Engineer are deemed to be more fitting to the conditions and use, such
sidewalks will be installed with the approval of the City Engineer. Subject to
the approval of City Council, the City shall pay for the entire additional cost
of construction over and above that required to install the standard sidewalk.
   (d)    Streets.
      (1)    Property assessed. All properties receiving direct benefit.
Assessments shall be levied only for the local share, a percentage thereof, of
any proposed roadway improvement projects. (Refer to Exhibit C)
      (2)    Assessment calculated. Special assessment charges shall be based
on either the front footage of the benefitting parcel (front footage
assessment) or the traffic generation characteristics of the benefitting parcel
benefit assessment. The front footage assessment shall be calculated by
multiplying by a fixed assessment rate. (Refer to Exhibit A).
   In the case of a corner lot in a residential district, the front footage
assessment shall be based on the entire front footage of the property less a
credit of sixty percent (60%) for roadway improvements along the "long side" of
the property. In addition, properties in a residential zoning district having
roadway frontage along both the front and rear yards shall not be assessed for
roadway improvements along the rear yard frontage.
   The benefit assessment shall be keyed to the traffic generation value for
each property within a designated special benefit district. The total traffic
generation at each site or potential site shall be tabulated and summarized
over the entire district so that a unit benefit can be assigned to each
generator. The benefit assessment methodology shall be employed only in those
cases where commercial and/or industrial properties located along a proposed
arterial or collector roadway improvement project have the potential for
generating heavy traffic volumes.
      (3)    Assessment rates. Assessment rates shall be adopted by resolution
of City Council. Property owners subject to payment of a special roadway
improvement assessment shall receive a credit for any proposed infrastructure
improvements already in place (e.g. sidewalks, curb and gutters).
   Assessment rates shall be based according to roadway assessment set forth in
Exhibit A.
   For local roadways, assessments shall only be levied if at least sixty
percent (60%) of the property owners abutting any roadway proposed for
improvement agree to be assessed to finance, the project shall be carried out.
If less than sixty percent (60%) of the owners agree to be assessed, the
project shall not be financed utilizing special assessments.
   The City does reserve the right, however, in those instances where the
condition of a local roadway has deteriorated to such an extent that it poses a
major public heath, safety or welfare concern, to finance the improvement of
such roadway utilizing special assessments without having to obtain the
approval of the abutting property owners as described above.
   For those local roadway improvement projects where it has been determined
that special assessments will be utilized to finance the improvement, abutting
residential property owners shall pay two-thirds (2/3) of the improvement cost
with the City paying the remaining one- third (1/3).
   Proposed local roadway improvements which only involve resurfacing, i.e. no
milling, grinding or reconstruction activity of any kind, shall not be financed
through the imposition of special assessments.
   For any curb and gutter work required as part of a roadway reconstruction
project, abutting property owners shall pay the cost of the improvement.
      (4)    Payback. Assessments for roadway improvements may be paid back
over a maximum period of twenty (20) years depending on the amount of
assessment owed (Refer to Exhibit B for payback schedule).
      (5)    Frequency of assessments. The frequency of assessments for street
improvements in residential zoning districts shall be limited by the provisions
set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 727.
   (e)    Storm Sewer.
(1)    Property assessed. No special assessments are to be levied for basin
wide storm drainage improvement projects except to the extent that the
assessment rates adopted for street improvements shall reflect on-site storm
drainage improvements. Major storm drainage improvements shall be accomplished
through the establishment of a City Stormwater Management Utility System.

   Repair or replacement
      Main—100% City
      Tap and service line—100% owner
Basic Rationale
1.    All new facilities are the responsibility of the developer or owner
building new home(s).
2.    Sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and street paving are facilities having
aesthetic or positive values on properties and, thus, new construction or
complete replacement should be partially assessed to the owner.
3.    Storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water lines are facilities having
lesser aesthetic value, are expected services to all properties and relate
negatively to the City as a whole if they do not exist. Thus more City-wide
benefits should be assessed in greater proportion to the City.
4.    Any possible areas of annexation should be treated as existing
subdivisions rather than a separate category placing the burden totally on
property owners.
5.    Other than sidewalks, which are the responsibility of property owners to
maintain and repair, all other facilities are the responsibility of the City to
maintain and thus to repair as needed.

   Annual payments shall be calculated from the assessment amount divided by
the applicable payback period. Where the assessment amounts on a project
include amounts calling for different payback periods, the longest payback
period shall apply to all assessments for the project.
(Ord. 33-99. Passed 9-7-99.)
EXHIBIT C
Criteria and Procedure for Granting Deferments or Waivers from Special
Assessments
I.    Deferments.
   Deferments are a postponement of assessments. These assessments shall be due
and payable at such time in the future as the condition justifying the deferral
ends.
A.    Full Deferments.
Property owners subject to an assessment may apply for a deferment of the full
amount of such assessment on the grounds of financial hardship as provided for
by Ohio R.C. 727.251. Grounds for claiming financial hardship shall include,
but not be limited to the following:
(1)    The property owner has filed for bankruptcy;
(2)    The property owner is a welfare recipient;
(3)    The proposed annual assessment is greater than five percent (5%) of the
property owner's gross annual income;
(4)    An assessment deferment for the property has been recommended by the
Mayor, subject to the approval of the City Council, as provided for under the
City's Economic Development Incentive Plan.
B.    Partial Deferments.
Deferments may be given on assessments for particular improvements under the
conditions stated below, which shall be deemed to be financial hardships, but
all other assessments against the property not deferred or waived shall be due
and payable.
(1)    Water or Sewer Improvements.
The City Council reserves the right to require all owners to tap into water and
sewer lines as soon as they become available to the property. Council shall
ordinarily make this "tap-in" determination prior to adopting the ordinance to
proceed. However, if Council chooses on a particular project not to require
immediate tap-in, the owner may request a deferral of the assessment for these
utilities.
In such a case where Council grants such a deferral, the owner shall normally
be required to begin making assessment payments at the date the next assessment
payments become due and payable after the time the "tap-in" is requested.
(2)    Sidewalks.
If a property is zoned residential but the owner is required to pay for more
than 120 feet of sidewalk because the property is deemed by the City Engineer
to be underdeveloped at the time of assessment, Council may grant a deferment
of the amount of the sidewalk assessment in excess of 120 feet.
In such a case where Council grants such a deferral, the owner shall normally
be required to begin making assessment payments at the date the next assessment
payments come due and payable after the earliest of:
(a)    The subdivision of the property;
(b)    The property being rezoned upon the request of the owner to a zoning
district other than one of those stated above; or
(c)    A zoning permit being granted for a new principal structure to be
constructed on the property.
(3)    Roadway Improvements.
If a property is zoned as a residential district but the property is declared
to be underdeveloped property by the City Engineer at the time of assessment,
Council may grant a deferment of up fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the
roadway improvement assessment to the owner after any applicable waiver has
been applied.
"Roadway improvement" shall include base and pavement, curbs and gutters, and
associated storm drainage, but shall not normally include sidewalks.
In a case where Council grants such a deferral, the owner shall normally be
required to begin making assessment payments at the date the next assessment
payments become due and payable after the earlier of:
(a)    The subdivision of the property;
(b)    The property being rezoned upon the request of the owner to a zoning
district other than one of those stated above;
(c)    A zoning permit being granted for a new principal structure to be
constructed on the property.
C.    Application For Deferments.
Application for a deferment of assessment shall be submitted to the City
Council not earlier than the adoption of assessment pursuant to Ohio R.C.
727.25. Applications are available from the Clerk of Council.
The application should also include the parcel tax identification number and
the proposed terms of the deferment requested.
D.    Council Action.
Council shall review the applicant's request for a deferment at a Council
meeting. A deferment request shall be deemed to be rejected unless it is
approved by resolution of the Council within forty-five days after the
ordinance of assessment is adopted.
Council shall examine the applicant's financial condition only to the extent
necessary to determine whether or not timely payment of the assessment will
cause a financial hardship. If Council determines that timely payment will
cause such a financial hardship, as defined above, it may by majority vote
provide for a deferred payment of all or part of the amount of the assessment
until the earliest of the following:
(a)    Such future date or dates as Council deems reasonable;
(b)    Such time as the property is sold or transferred by the applicant and
the buyer does not qualify for continuation of the deferral;
(c)    Such time as the property becomes subject to estate taxes under the Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5731.
E.    Deferment Fees.
Any charges, fees or other costs incurred by the City as a result of additional
accounting requirements or borrowing made necessary by the deferment shall be
known as "deferment fees". Deferment fees shall not include interest costs
incurred by the City as a result of the deferment in excess of the interest
added generally to the principal assessment for anyone else in the district who
chooses to pay their assessment over time. The deferment fees shall be added to
the amount of the assessment at the end of the deferment and collected in the
same manner as the assessment.
F.    Deferred Assessments a Lien.
The amount of any assessment deferred shall be a lien upon the property until
full payment is received by the City, even if the length of the deferral
exceeds the length of time for repayment of the assessment by others in the
special assessment district. The applicant shall have a duty to notify the City
at such time as the condition of deferral ends. The City shall notify the
County Auditor annually of properties which are entitled to continued
deferrals.
G.    Procedure When Deferral Ends.
Once the condition justifying deferral ends, the assessment and deferment fees
shall become immediately due and payable. The City shall delete the property
from its list of deferred properties. The County Auditor shall then assess on
the next tax bill all unpaid principal and interest amounts and deferment fees.
(1)    If the special assessment has not yet been fully repaid by the other
properties in the special assessment district, the principal and interest due
and payable in that installment shall also be due and payable along with the
deferred principal and interest and deferment fees.
(2)    If the special assessment has been fully repaid by the other properties
in the special assessment district, the principal and interest and deferment
fees shall be due and payable.
Deferment which ends during a tax year shall be prorated on the basis of the
number of days which have elapsed since December 31 compared to the number of
days in the calendar year. This prorated amount shall be added to the
subsequent year's assessment.
II.    Waivers.
Where assessments are waived, the City shall make such payments so long as the
condition stated in the resolution has not ceased to exist and ended the
waiver. The property owner or future owner shall have no duty to repay the City
for payments made on the assessments by the City. If the special assessment
payments for the project have all been made by the City before the condition
stated in the resolution ceases to exist, the owner of the property does not
have to pay any of the assessment.
A.    General Conditions for Waivers.
Property owners subject to an assessment may apply for a waiver of the
assessment on the grounds that there exists unique circumstances associated
with the owner's property that would render the imposition of the assessment an
undue hardship. The City may choose to grant a waiver of some or all of the
assessments where it finds the conditions are met. Grounds for claiming such a
hardship shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1)    The use of the property;
(2)    The existence of improvements provided by the property owner in the past
or future;
(3)    The existence of unique site characteristics such as access or
topography;
(4)    An assessment waiver for the property has been requested or has been
successfully processed for a Community Reinvestment Tax Abatement;
(5)    The property impacted is owned by a church or other nonprofit
organization.
B.    Roadway Improvement Waivers.
In regard to roadway improvement, defined as base and pavement, curb and
gutters and associated storm drainage, but normally not including the
sidewalks, an owner may apply for a waiver under the conditions set out below:
For roadway improvements on roadways, properties zoned residential shall be
eligible for a waiver of approximately fifty percent (50%) of the local share
so long as they remain so zoned. Since the City pays fifty percent (50%) of the
local share also, these owners will then have no assessments for the roadway
improvements so long as the waiver exists.
C.    Application for Waivers.
Applications for a waiver of assessment may be submitted to Council not earlier
than the adoption of the ordinance to proceed with the improvement and not
later than fifteen days after adoption of an ordinance of assessment.
Applications shall be available from the Municipal Building. The application
will state the specific basis for the hardship claimed. The application will
also include the parcel tax identification number and whether full or partial
waiver is being requested. If a partial waiver is requested, the percentage of
the amount requested to be waived will be stated.
D.    Council Action.
Council shall review the applicant's request for a waiver at a Council meeting.
A waiver request shall be deemed to be rejected unless it is approved by
resolution of Council within forty-five days after the ordinance of assessment
is adopted.
If Council determines that timely payment will cause an undue hardship it may,
by majority vote, adopt a resolution waiving payment by applicant of part or
all of the assessment. Such a waiver shall be conditional.
E.    Waived Assessments a Lien.
The assessment shall be placed as a lien against the property and the City
shall make such part of the annual payments (as stated in the resolution) so
long as the stated conditions in the resolution continue to exist, as provided
in the resolution. Until such condition ceases to exist and the waiver ends,
the City shall make the assessment payments for the property as they become due
and payable. The applicant shall have the duty to notify the City at such time
as the condition of waiver ends.
A certified copy of the resolution waiving the assessment shall be placed in
the records of the County Auditor. The City shall notify the County Auditor
annually of properties for which the assessments are waived for the next year.
F.    Procedure When Waiver Ends.
After such condition ceases to exist and the waiver ends, the property owner
shall make all future assessment payments for the property as they come due and
payable.
Waivers which end during a tax year shall be prorated on the basis of the
number of days which have elapsed since December 31 compared to the number of
days in the calendar year. This prorated amount shall be added to the
subsequent year's assessment.
III.    Notice.
In each special assessment proceeding, Council shall notify all owners of
assessed property of the availability of deferrals and waivers. Such notice
shall be in the form Council shall prescribe from time to time.

937.02 NONACCEPTABLE WASTEWATER AND INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT.
   (a)    The City shall make and enforce rules and regulations establishing
the types and characteristics of sewage, industrial wastes and other matters
which shall be discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, the types and
characteristics of sewage and industrial wastes admissible to the system only
after pretreatment, requisites for pretreatment, and otherwise governing the
discharge of sewage, industrial wastes and other matters into the system in the
interest of safety and efficient operation of the wastewater treatment plant.
Applicable industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial pretreatment
regulations, as promulgated under Section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act, are
hereby incorporated into this chapter and made a part thereof.
   (b)    An industry shall, upon application for sewer service, present to the
City a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be discharged to
the sewerage system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is not available,
the expected waste analysis based upon similar processes now in operation.
   (c)    In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it will
damage the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the City shall compel such users to dispose of such
waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (d)    In cases where the character of the sewage or industrial waste from
any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it
imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage collection, pumping or treatment
works greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering the sewerage
system, the City may: compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building
or premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as specified by the City
before discharging it into the sewerage system; require flow control or
equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug" loads or excessive loads
that may be harmful to the treatment works; or require payment of a surcharge
on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover
the additional costs of having capacity for and treatment of such wastes.
   (e)    The discharge of nonacceptable industrial wastewater into the
sewerage system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater
shall be deemed nonacceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic
substances in the wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic
or harmful substances include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
 
            Tolerable Limits
Toxic or Harmful Substance    (milligrams per liter)
   Arsenic          0.2
   Barium          1.0
   Boron             5.0
   Cadmium          0.1

   Zinc             2.0
   Radioactive substances    Gross beta activity (in the known absence of
strontium and Alpha emitters) - 1,000 micro curies per liter.
   The preceding list of toxic or harmful substances is subject to revisions as
required to meet current water quality standards or effluent standards imposed
by state or federal agencies. In special cases (low volume users), the
concentration of toxic or harmful substances in the wastewater may be exceeded
if it is determined by the City that the total pounds of toxic or harmful
substances discharged to the sewage system are not harmful to or shall not
interfere with the sewage treatment process or shall not violate water quality
or effluent standards.
   (f)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, either directly
or indirectly to the sewerage system, any of the following described
substances, materials, waters or wastes:
      (1)    Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°
Fahrenheit.
      (2)    Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, mineral oil or other
volatile flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas.
      (3)    Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance which, either singly or
by interaction with other wastes, is capable of creating a public nuisance or
hazard to life or of preventing entry into the sewers for their maintenance and
repair.
      (4)    Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than
9.0, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard
to structures, equipment or personnel of the sewerage system.
      (5)    Any ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass,
rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings,
entrails, lime slurry, lime, chemical or paint residues, cannery wastes, bulk
solids or any other solid objects or viscous substance capable of causing
obstruction to the flow operation of the sewerage system.
      (6)    Any waters or wastes containing a toxic or poisonous substance in
sufficient quantity to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, or create any hazard in the receiving
waters of the sewerage system.
      (7)    Any water or wastes containing emulsified oil or grease exceeding,
on analysis, an average of fifty milligrams of oil and grease per liter
determined as total ether soluble matter.
       (8)    Any garbage that has not been properly shredded to a degree that
all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions of the sewer and
with no particle greater than one-half inch in any dimension.
       (9)    Any water or wastes containing suspended solids of such character
or quality that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such
materials at the sewage treatment plant, or having a chlorine demand greater
than twenty-five parts per million.
    The above list is subject to revisions as required to meet current water
quality standards imposed by the state or federal agencies.
   (g)    No statement contained in this section shall be interpreted as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment. In all such cases, the provisions
set forth in establishing sewer service charges shall be governing factors in
any contracts entered into.
   (h)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Sanitary Engineer, they are necessary for proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (i)    Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily
removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight.
Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by
the owner at his expense, in continuous efficient operation at all times.
(Ord. 13-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.03 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)    No person shall discharge into any natural outlet within the City, or
in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, any wastewater or other
polluted waters.
   (b)    No person shall construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic
tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of
wastewater without first obtaining the required permits from the City.
   (c)    No person, firm or corporation shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any storm water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.
   (d)    No person shall discharge into the building sanitary sewer the
surface water which collects in basement or foundation excavations. If the
building sanitary sewer is complete before the plumbing can be connected
thereto, the builder or sewer tapper shall keep the end of the building
sanitary sewer tightly closed with a plumber's plug or other watertight plug.
   (e)    The owner(s) of all houses, building or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated within the City
and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located
or may in the future be located a public sanitary or combined sewer of the
City, is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet
facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly to the proper
public sewer in accordance with the rules and regulations within ninety days
after date of official notice to do so, provided the foundation wall of the
structure from which sewage or other wastes originated is less than 100 feet
from the nearest boundary of the right-of-way within which the sewer is
located.
   (f)    No person, firm or corporation shall be permitted to connect to or
discharge wastewater to the City sewage system unless it has been determined by
the City that there is sufficient capacity in the system to collect, convey and
treat the proposed wastewater discharge of such person, firm or corporation.
   (g)    No person shall place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any
unsanitary manner on public or private property within the City or in any area
under the jurisdiction of the City, any human or animal excrement, garbage or
other objectionable waste.
   (h)    Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers,
or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water
or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the
Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer or natural outlet.
   (i)    Where preliminary treatment by flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (j)    When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (k)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods of the Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from
periodic grab samples.)
(Ord. 12-2-74-A. Passed 1-20-75; Ord. 13-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.04 WASTEWATER MONITORING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)    All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts and
concentrations of such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of this chapter and any applicable state or federal
pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (b)    Such records shall be made available upon request by the City. All
such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made
available to officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
upon demand.
   (c)    If so ordered by the City, the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
   (d)    The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way, with the approval of the
public agency having jurisdiction of such right-of-way, and located so that it
will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (e)    When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge.
 
   (f)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
 
   (g)    Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section
937.02 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-
four hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined
necessary by the City in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
 
   (h)    Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods",
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U. S. EPA,
or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications stall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA). In addition, all measurement, tests and analysis of the characteristics
of wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the October 16, 1975
Federal Register (40 CFR Part 136) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants".
 
   (i)    Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination,
with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in Section
937.02, will be done at such intervals as designated by the City.
 
   (j)    Duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper credentials and
identifications, shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
 
   (k)    Duly authorized City employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may
withhold information considered confidential provided that the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   (l)   While performing necessary work for private properties referred to in
subsection (j) hereof, the City or duly authorized employees of the City shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.
(Ord. 13-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.05 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (a)    Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by
the City before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)    If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the City so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the City detailing the date, time and cause of the
accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and
corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 13-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.06 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; HEARING; APPEAL.
   (a)    Whenever the City finds that any person has violated or is violating
any prohibition, limitation or provision of this chapter, they may serve upon
such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, for a satisfactory
correction thereof. Such notice shall also state that any person in violation
of this chapter shall be liable for any resulting damages or applicable fines.
   (b)    If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the City may
order any person who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause
before the Hearing Board why service should not be terminated. A notice shall
be served on the offending party, specifying the time and place of a hearing to
be held by the Hearing Board regarding the violation, and directing the
offending party to show cause before the Hearing Board why an order should not
be made directing the termination of service. The notice of the hearing shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any
agent or officer of a corporation.
   (c)    The Hearing Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the
evidence, or may
designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the Hearing Board
to:
      (1)    Issue in the name of the Hearing Board notices of hearings
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in any such hearings.
      (2)    Take the evidence.
      (3)    Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Hearing
Board for action thereon.
   (d)    At any public hearing, testimony taken before the Hearing Board or
any person designated by it, must be under oath and recorded stenographically.
The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public
or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor.
   (e)    After the Hearing Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the party responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances shall have been
installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances are properly operated, and such further orders and directives are
as necessary and appropriate.
   (f)   Any discharge in violation of the substantive provisions of this
chapter or an
order of the Hearing Board shall be considered a public nuisance. If any person
discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the City treatment
system contrary to the substantive provisions of this chapter, or any order of
the Hearing Board, the Law Director shall commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief in the Pike County Common Pleas Court.
   (g)    Whoever violates any order of the Hearing Board shall be punished as
provided in Section
937.99.
   (h)    Any recipient of sewer service shall have the right of appeal before
the Hearing Board to express grievances and appeal bills or administrative
decision.
(Ord. 13-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.07 SURCHARGES.
   (a)    Sewage or industrial wastes above normal sewage strength, but
acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system shall be subject to
a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or both
of two constituents of water or waste:
      (1)    Total suspended solids, and/or
      (2)    Five day BOD at twenty degrees Centigrade and as herein provided.
   (b)    When either or both the total suspended solids and the BOD of a water
or waste accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of their
constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as
the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
      (1)    Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.158/lb. = suspended
solids surcharge.
      (2)    Pounds of excess BOD per day x $0.154/lb. = BOD surcharge.
      
   (c)    In addition to the surcharge, the user shall pay the user charges.
   (d)    The pounds of BOD per day and/or pounds of suspended solids per day,
above the concentrations previously described for normal strength sewage that
are discharged to the sewerage system, shall be determined by the City or their
authorized representative.
   (e)    In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the City
shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other
pollutant into the sewage system or for any other reason that it deems
necessary and appropriate, such as excessively high rates of discharge.
(Ord. 12-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
937.08 PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (a)    Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available the
building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system complying
with subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)    The type, capacities, location and layout of a private sewage
disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the Department of
Health of Pike County and the State of Ohio and shall be of subsurface soil
absorption type and create no odor or health problems. The owner shall operate
and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all
times, at no expense to the City.
   (c)    At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served
by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a
direct connection shall be made to the sewer within ninety days and the private
sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with clean bank-
run gravel or dirt.
(Ord. 12-2-74-A. Passed 1-20-75.)
937.09 BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or
opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the Superintendent.
 
   (b)    There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: (1) for
residential and commercial service, and (2) for service to establishments
producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the City. The permit application
shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information
considered pertinent in the judgment of the Superintendent. A permit and
inspection fee for either type sewer permit shall be paid to the City at the
time the application is filed.
 
   (c)    All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the building sewer.
 
   (d)    A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
 
   (e)    Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
 
   (f)    The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench, shall conform to the requirements of
Section
937.10(a). In the absence of provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, the ASTM and WPCF manual of practice No. 9
shall apply.
 
   (g)    Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
buildings at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which
any building drain is too low to permit gravity to flow to the public sewer,
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer.
 
   (h)    No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior or
interior foundation drains, sump pumps connected to foundation drains, areaway
drains, loading dock drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater
to a building sewer or building drain which is in turn connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (i)    The connection of the building sewer into an existing public sewer
shall be made with a forty-five degree angle pointing downstream. Two forty-
five degree els may be used to make a long ninety degree angle thereby allowing
a shorter run of building sewer pipe. The connection to the main sewer pipe
shall be made with an approved cast iron connector and made watertight and
strong by encasing in concrete for a distance of six inches in all directions
from outer edge of tap.
   (j)    The connections for building sewers shall be provided for when new
sewer main is installed by installing forty-five degree wyes for each lot. When
new streets are involved, the building sewer shall be installed to each lot
line and tested with the main sewer.
   (k)    All building sewer connections are to be recorded as to distance to
downstream manhole. Lot line connections to be recorded by triangulation from
both downstream and upstream manholes and marked with a two inch by four inch
piece of wood extending from the end of pipe to not less than one inch above
final grade of lot.
   (l)   All new or repaired old building sewer pipe shall have a cleanout
installed using either a large side outlet tee or two wyes facing each other so
the sewer may be cleaned either way. Also a cleanout connection at the opposite
side of the building or in the basement may serve as a cleanout. The cleanout
must be strong and water and airtight. If installed in yard, the connections
must be set in concrete.
   (m)    The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent twenty-four hours before the building sewer is ready for
inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made
during normal working hours of the City Sewer Department and under the
supervision of the Superintendent or his representative.
   (n)    All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazards.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
   (o)    All building sewers shall be properly maintained by the property
owner at no
expense to the City. If the building sewer becomes in need of repair to the
point that the sewage system is affected, the Superintendent, upon notice to
the property owner may make necessary repairs to such sewer and bill the owner
for same.
   (p)    Where the building sewer is suspended across a lower ditch such as
the area around a basement wall, either cast iron or asbestos-cement pipe must
be used to bridge the open space.
(Ord. 12-2-74-A. Passed 1-20-75.)
937.10 MAIN SANITARY SEWER DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)    New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily
per capita flow of sewage of not less than 100 gallons per day. When sewers are
designed on a running full basis, the following per capita sewage contributions
exclusive of industrial flow should be used:
      (1)    Building sewers - 400 gallons per capita per day.
      (2)    Main sewers - 250 gallons per capita per day.
   (b)    No building sewer shall be less than six inches in diameter.
   (c)    No sanitary sewer main shall be less than eight inches in diameter.
   (d)    In general, sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to receive sewage
from basements and to allow for further extensions. At no time shall a sewer be
less than two foot in depth unless encased in concrete.
   (e)    Slopes of sewers may be greater but not less than the following:
 
Sewer (inches)    Minimum slope in feet per 100 feet
   6            0.60
   8            0.40
   10            0.28
   12             0.22
   14             0.17
   15             0.15
   16             0.14
   18             0.12
   21             0.10
   24             0.08
   27             0.67
   30             0.058
   36             0.046
   Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on twenty
percent (20%) slope or greater shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors
or equal, spaced
as follows:
       (1)    Not over thirty-six feet center to center on grades twenty
percent (20%) and up to thirty-five percent (35%).
      (2)    Not over twenty-four feet center to center on grades thirty-five
percent (35%) and up to fifty percent (50%).
      (3)    Not over sixteen feet center to center on grades fifty percent
(50%) and over.
   (f)    Sewers twenty-four inches or less shall be laid with straight
alignment between manholes.
   (g)    When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the invert of the larger
sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy gradient. An
approximate method for securing these results is to place the 0.8 depth point

section including manholes shall be deemed to unsatisfactory performance.
      (4)    The allowable leakage is based on a maximum difference in
elevation of eight feet between the level of water at the upper manhole and the
invert of the pipe being tested in the lower manhole. If the difference in
elevation exceeds eight feet, the allowable leakage shall be increased five
percent (5%) for each one foot in excess of eight feet.
   (c)    It is understood that each section, as above described, must be
tested and determined by the Superintendent to conform to this section before
such section or sections may become part of the City system. It is further
understood that, if the leakage does not come within the limits specified, the

   (e)   “Sewer service charge” means the total charge levied against users of
the sewage system for sewer service. The charge shall include user charges plus
the cost of debt service.
      (Ord. 12-82. Passed 6-21-82.)
941.02 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   (1)   The per gallon calculation for all amounts in excess of the
minimum shall be changed to per one hundred (100) gallons of use instead of per
one thousand (1,000) gallons and an automatic annual three percent (3%) rate
increase shall be effective on March 1, 2020 and annually thereafter on the
first day of March for the minimum rate and excess rates as currently set forth
below.
      (2)   Residential Sewer Rate. The residential sewer rate for all users
consuming zero to four thousand (0-4,000) gallons or less of sewer is the
minimum bill of $37.32, per quarter, for each customer and this is the
equivalent of $0.933 per one hundred (100) gallons for four thousand (4,000)
gallons. The excess rate for all users consuming over four thousand (4,000)
gallons will be charged at $0.510 per one hundred (100) gallons used per
quarter for each customer.
      (3)   Commercial Sewer Rate. The commercial sewer rate for all users
consuming zero to four thousand (0-4,000) gallons or less of sewer is the
minimum bill of $37.32, per quarter, for each customer and this is the
equivalent of $0.933 per one hundred (100) gallons for four thousand (4,000)
gallons. The excess rate for all users consuming over four thousand (4,000)
gallons will be charged at $0.510 per one hundred (100) gallons used per
quarter for each customer, plus an additional surcharge of $0.025 per one
hundred (100) gallons over the minimum of four thousand (4,000) gallons of
sewer per quarter.
         (Ord. 7-2020. Passed 2-18-20.)
   (b)   Annual Review of Charges. The sewer service charge and user charges
shall be reviewed annually by the Village in order to determine whether or not
they are sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization costs and annual
cost of operation and maintenance of the sewerage system. If the difference
between the total annual revenue derived and the total annual cost is
sufficient to justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service charge or
user charges, the Village shall adjust the rates as required. The purpose of
the annual review is also to maintain a proportional user charge and industrial
cost recovery system. Each user to be notified at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer
service charge which is attributable to OM&R costs of wastewater treatment
services.
   (c)   Late Payment Charges. All users shall be billed quarterly for their

   Where water is leaking on a customer’s premises where the water does not run
into a sewer drain, it shall be necessary for the customer to pay for the lost
water, but he will not be charged the sewer fee for such lost water, amount of
the credit to be determined by the Water Department. (Ord. 12-2-74AB. Passed 4-
21-75.)
941.05  PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING AND CALCULATING ADJUSTMENTS FOR WATER AND SEWER
DEPARTMENTS.
   (a)   (1)   Monthly billing for water and sewer commercial and residential
customers shall be billed at $12.44 for the first 1,333.3 gallons, plus an
additional amount of $0.51 per 100 gallons used thereafter for any and all
usage amounts. On commercial or non-residential a $0.025 surcharge per 100
gallons on the amount of usage in excess of the minimum.
         (Ord. 12-2020. Passed 3-3-20.)
      (2)   For example: For a residential client with 4,000 gallons usage per
month, the calculation will be as follows: $12.08 (minimum bill for the first
1,333.3 gallons) + $13.20 (2,666.7 gal. x $4.95 per thousand gallons) = $25.28
per month for water and the same amount per month for sewer, therefore the
total bill $50.56.
      (3)   The charges made to an apartment complex are made across the number
of units. The bills shall be made to the complex per master reading.
      (4)   The Director or the head of the respective department shall have
the authority to make adjustments or sewer offsets that are required for
specific reasons.
   (b)   The Office Manager for the Sewer Department and Water Department
calculates and enters adjustments with approval and signature of the Director
or the head of the respective Departments. Examples of adjustments, but not
limited to, are as following: water leaks that do not enter into sewer system;
meter misread; pool fill-ups; lawn irrigation; meter over/under estimated.
   (c)   The Directors or the heads of the Water and Sewer Department are
hereby authorized and directed to adjust, from time to time, the dollar amount
of the base charge and/or the sewer use rate fixed and established in this
Ordinance to reflect any increase or decrease in such amount charged by the
Village of Waverly, Ohio and to approve in writing monthly adjustments for
normal and ordinary adjustments that occur (for example, meter calculation
issues (over estimates or misreading), pool fill ups, or leaks and shall take
effect immediately with a written report to be provided to Council monthly.
Provided however, Council shall approve unusual or unique requests for
adjustments (for example, late fees, special requests for discounts, or
extenuating circumstances) in writing prior to any such adjustment to reflect
any increase or decrease in such amount charged by the Village of Waverly and
no such adjustment for this special situations shall take effect until the
billing date following the Directors or the heads of the respective
Department's filing with the Clerk of Council of a notice of the base charge
adjustment or sewer use rate adjustment, as the case may be.
   (d)   Swimming Pools.  Property owners with swimming pools will be eligible
for an annual fill-up adjustment for sewer charges when the pool is filled with
water through the meter. Adjustments will not be made for refilling after
initial fill-up. Residents are required to call the Water Department to inform
staff when they want to fill their pool(s). The billing clerk, with the
approval of the respective department Director, will adjust the sewer bill for
the water used to fill the pool. The size of the pool (dimensions and number of
gallons) will be ascertained and verified and will be used to determine the
sewer bill adjustment. If the number of gallons used in filling the pool is
less than the number of gallons normally required to fill the pool, the average
sewer bill will be calculated and the amount of sewer over the average will be
adjusted. Provided, however, that pools that contain less than ten thousand
(10,000) gallons shall not be eligible for the sewer adjustment under this
section. The water used to fill the pool shall be billed on the customer's
water bill in the same manner and at the same rate as all other water used by
said customer, as said rates are amended from time to time. Pools established
for commercial use where user fees for profit are charged for access to such a
pool, and are located within the establishment of a valid, legal business
operating inside the Village of Waverly, may qualify for bulk rate pricing for
only the amount of water used to fill the pool. No discounted sewer rate
applies to water discharged into the sanitary sewer from pools which received
bulk rate pricing.
   (e)   Irrigation Charges. Separate irrigation charges apply to any meter
that is used solely for the irrigation of lawns, gardens, landscaped areas,
orchards, and similar horticultural uses where the metered water is not
returned to the Village of Waverly waste water system. The water used shall be
billed on the customer's water bill in the same manner and at the same rate as
all other water used by said customer, as said rates are amended from time to
time. Provided, however, that no sewer charges shall apply for the water used
for the aforementioned purposes only. Further, the customer shall not connect
the separate meter used for irrigation purposes to any plumbing fixture located
inside the residence or dwelling.

for Municipal garbage and refuse collection and disposal. The fees to be
charged are subject to approval by Council.
   This chapter permits the contractor to require payment for service in
advance of the rendering of such service. It also permits the contractor to
establish rates of payment which would reward subscribers for paying once,
twice or four times per year at twelve month, six month or three month
intervals as this too would reduce the cost of doing business and help to
minimize the fees for subscribers. The contractor may add a penalty to the
account of each subscriber who becomes delinquent in making his payment for
service. If the account is sixty days or more past due, the contractor may stop
service and levy a start-up charge for restarting the service.

1113.01 ESTABLISHMENT; MEMBERSHIP.
   There is hereby established a Municipal Planning Commission. The Commission
shall consist of five members appointed by Council. The first members of the
Commission shall serve respectively for the following terms: one for one year;
one for two years; one for three years; one for four years; one for five years.
   The successor of each member so appointed shall serve for a period of five
years.
Vacancies shall be filled by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by Council for
the unexpired
term. Members may be removed by Council for cause after written charges have
been
filed, and after a public hearing has been held if demanded by the member so
charged.
   The Commission shall annually elect a chairman from its membership. The
chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and
compel the attendance of
witnesses.
   The Clerk of Council shall act as clerk for the Commission and shall make
and keep a record of all its meetings and official acts. The Municipal Planning
Commission may solicit input from all City departments regarding the effect of
any appeal or proposed variation.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Adopting Ordinance; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-
10.)
1113.02 MEETINGS; MINUTES; APPEALS AND VARIATION CRITERIA.
   All meetings of the Municipal Planning Commission shall be held at the call
of the chairman and at such other times as the Commission may determine. There
shall be at least fifteen days but not more than thirty-days notice of the time
and place of such meeting published in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City; the notice shall contain a statement of the particular purposes of
the meeting and a brief description of the location of the property or
properties under consideration at the meeting.
   All meetings of the Commission shall be open to the public.
   The Commission shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon every question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact; and shall also keep records of its examinations and other official
actions. Findings of fact shall be included in the minutes on each case and the
reasons for granting or denying each application shall be specified. Every rule
or regulation, and every order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Municipal Planning Commission shall immediately be filed in the office of the
Clerk of Council and shall be a public record.
   The minutes of the Commission shall be open to public examination at
reasonable hours.
   The Commission shall adopt its own rules of procedure; a copy of which and
all recommendations thereto shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of
Council.
   Expenses incurred by the Commission are to be itemized and shall be borne by
the City.
   In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this Zoning
Ordinance, the Commission shall, before granting any variation from the Zoning
Ordinance in a specific case, first determine and make a finding of fact that
the proposed variation will not: (a) impair an adequate supply of light and air
to adjacent property; (b) unreasonably increase the congestion in public
streets; (c) increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety; (d)
unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding area; (e) merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but is
necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship or difficulty; or in any
other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of
the inhabitants of the City. (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010.
Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.03 APPEAL PROCEDURE; HEARINGS.
   Any person aggrieved by a ruling of the Zoning Administrator or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City concerning the interpretation
of this Zoning Ordinance, may appeal to the Municipal Planning Commission.
   The Commission shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing of
appeals and shall give notice of the hearing to the persons appealing and to
the officer from whom the appeal is taken. It shall hear the appeal within a
reasonable time. At the hearing, parties of interest may appear in person or by
agent or attorney.
   The appeal shall be taken within thirty days by the Commission and shall be
taken by filing with the Clerk of Council and with the Commission a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof, together with such plats and exhibits as
are reasonably necessary. The appeal shall be taken upon forms provided by the
Commission. The Clerk of Council shall forthwith transmit to the Commission all
of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken.
   The Commission shall hear appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrator.
   The Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or
amend the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from to the
extent and in the manner that the Commission may decide is fitting and proper
in the premises, and to that end the Commission shall also have all the powers
of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   A majority vote of the members of the Commission shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it
is authorized by this Zoning Ordinance to render decisions.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.04 VARIATIONS.
   (a)    Purpose. A variation is that power to permit municipalities to vary
the requirements of a Zoning Ordinance. Variations should be granted solely to
provide relief under unusual conditions and only when in harmony with the
general intent and purpose of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Conditions. In making its determination as to whether there is
unnecessary hardship, the Municipal Planning Commission shall take into
consideration the extent to which the following conditions, favorable to the
applicant or appellant, have been established by evidence:
      (1)    The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience or loss or
revenue if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
      (2)    The conditions upon which the requested variation is based would
not be applicable generally to other properties within the same zoning
classification;
      (3)    The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property;
      (4)    The granting of the variation will not be materially detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which- the property is located;
      (5)    The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion in the
public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
and
      (6)    The proposed variation complies with the spirit and intent of the
restrictions imposed by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (7)    The proposed variation will benefit the community.
   (c)    Application. An application for a variation of the regulations of
this Zoning Ordinance may be made by a property owner or his agent to the
Commission. Such applications shall be made in writing, stating the variation
requested, the location of the property for which the variation is requested,
the name and address of the property owner and the cause for the requested
variation, the name and last known address of the proximate property owners who
would be affected by the proposed variation, a statement as to how the proposed
variation will meet the criteria and conditions set out in Sections
1113.02 and
1113.04(b).
   (d)    Public Hearing. The Commission shall fix a reasonable time and place
for the public hearing and shall give notice of the time and place of the
public hearing to proximate property owners by regular first class mail, not
less than seven days prior to the hearing, and published at least once, not
more than thirty days and not less than fifteen days before the hearing, in a
newspaper with a general circulation within the City.
   (e)    Decision Within Thirty Days. The Commission shall either grant or
deny the requested variation within thirty days after the public hearing.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Adopting Ordinance; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-
10.)
1113.05 SPECIAL EXCEPTION VARIATIONS.
   (a)    Purpose. The development and execution of this Zoning Ordinance is
based upon the division of the City into districts within which the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location. Such uses fall into two
categories:
      (1)    Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest;
      (2)    Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (b)    Initiation of Special Exception Variations. Any person owning or
having an interest in the subject property may file an application to use such
land for one or more of the uses provided for in this Zoning Ordinance in the
zoning district in which the land is situated.
   (c)    Application for Special Exception Variation. An application for a use
variation shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator upon a form prescribed
by him. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data
prescribed by the Administrator and shall include a statement in writing by the
applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed use variation will
conform to the standards set forth herein.
   (d)    Application Hearing. Upon receipt, in proper form, of the application
and statement referred to in subsection (c) hereof, the Municipal Planning
Commission shall fix a reasonable time and place for a public hearing and shall
give notice of the time and place of the hearing, published at least once, not
more than thirty days and not less than fifteen days before the hearing, in one
or more newspapers published in the City, or if no newspaper is published
therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the
City.
   (e)    Authorization. In considering each application for a special use
variation, the Commission shall include such stipulations or additional
conditions and the means by which such conditions will be complied with when
they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. The
Commission may grant or deny any application for a use variation provided,
however, that in the event of written protest against any proposed special
exception variation, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent of
the frontage immediately adjoining the property proposed for a special use
variation, or by the owners of twenty percent of the frontage across an alley
or directly opposite therefrom, such use variation shall not be granted except
by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the members of the Commission.
   (f)    Standards. No special use variation shall be recommended by the
Commission unless the Commission finds that:
      (1)    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the use will not be
detrimental to or endanger the public safety, health, morals, comfort or
general welfare;
      (2)    The use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      (3)    The establishment of the use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted
in the district;
      (4)    Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)    Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      (6)    The use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may in each instance be modified by Council pursuant to the recommendations of
the Commission.
         (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.06 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   Planned developments are of such substantially different character from
other special use variations that specific and additional standards and
exceptions are hereby established to govern the recommendations of the
Municipal Planning Commission and the action of Council.
   (a)    Special Conditions. In the case of residential, business or
manufacturing planned developments, the Commission may recommend, and Council
may authorize, that there is in part of the area of such development and for
the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the use
regulations for the district in which such development is located, provided the
Commission finds that:
      (1)    The uses permitted by the variation are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
      (2)    The uses permitted by the special exception variation are not of
such a nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the
surrounding neighborhood;
      (3)    Not more than twenty percent of the ground area or of the gross
floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the
special exception variation;
      (4)    In a manufacturing planned development such additional uses
allowed by special exception variation shall conform with the performance
standards of the district in which the development is located as set forth
herein;
      (5)    The special exception variation so allowed is reflected by the
appropriate zoning district symbols and so recorded on the Zoning District Map.
   (b)    Bulk Regulations. In the case of any planned development, the
Commission may recommend and Council may authorize variations to the applicable
bulk regulations of this Zoning Ordinance within the boundaries of such
development, provided the Commission finds that:
      (1)    Such variation shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of the
development, as well as of neighboring properties, than would be obtained under
the bulk regulations of this Zoning Ordinance for buildings developed on
separate zoning lots;
      (2)    The overall minimum lot area or maximum lot coverage of a
residential planned development would not exceed by more than fifteen percent
the requirements for individual uses in the district in which such planned
development is located;
      (3)    The minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements herein shall
not be decreased by more than fifteen percent in any such development
containing residential uses, and that there shall be available to each
residential building and immediately adjacent thereto, including the land area
upon which it is erected, the minimum amount of land area required for such
building under the lot area per dwelling unit provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (4)    Spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent
to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly developed
under the terms of this Ordinance on separate zoning lots, due consideration
being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening streets and
alleys; and
      (5)    Along the periphery of such planned developments, yards shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which the
development is located.
         (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.07 CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTION VARIATION.
   Prior to the granting of any special use variation, the Municipal Planning
Commission shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special
exception variation as deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified
herein. In all cases in which special exception variations are granted, the
Municipal Planning Commission shall require such evidence and guarantees as it
deems necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith
are being and will be, complied with. (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-
2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.08 EFFECT OF DENIAL OF SPECIAL EXCEPTION VARIATION.
   No application for a special exception variation which has been denied
wholly or in part by Council shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from
the date of the denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
changed conditions found to be valid by the Municipal Planning Commission.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.09 REVOCATION OF SPECIAL EXCEPTION VARIATION.
   In any case where a special exception variation has not been established
within one year after the date of granting thereof, then without further action
by the Municipal Planning Commission, the special exception variation
authorization shall be void.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.10 CHANGE OF ZONING ORDINANCE PROHIBITED.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to give or grant to the
Municipal Planning Commission the power or authority to alter or change the
Zoning Ordinance or any use district made a part of the Zoning Map; such power
and authority is reserved to Council. The Commission shall not have any power
or authority with respect to any alterations or change of the Zoning Ordinance
except to make recommendations in such specific cases as may properly
come before the Commission. (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010.
Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.11 TIME LIMIT FOR INITIATION OF USE VARIATION.
   No order for a use variation permitting the erection or alteration of a
building shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless such use is
established within such period; however, where such permitted use is dependent
upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in
force and effect if a permit for the erection or alteration is obtained within
such period and the erection or alteration is started and proceeds to
completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67. )
1113.12 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The appeal shall stay all proceedings and furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Municipal Planning
Commission after notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property; in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Commission or
by a court of record on application, with notice to the officer from whom the
appeal is taken, and all due causes shown.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67; Ord. 55-2010. Passed 9-21-10.)
1113.13 ZONING VARIATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)    When circumstances arise which create a condition requiring the
submission of a request for a variation to the Municipal Planning Commission it
is important to enable the Commission to intelligently review the situation,
that the facts and circumstance under which the request is submitted be fully
presented to the Commission in the application.
   (b)    To assist an applicant in the preparation of a request for a

1121.02 ZONING MAP.
   The boundaries of the zoning districts heretofore designated are hereby
established as shown on the map entitled Official Zoning Map, January, 1973,
revised July, 1974, which Map accompanies and is made a part of original
Ordinance 77-10, passed June 6, 1977, and shall have the same force and effect
as if the Zoning Map, together with all notations, references and other
information shown thereon, were fully set forth and described herein.
(Ord. 77-10. Passed 6-6-77.)
1121.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Whenever uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   District boundary lines are either the center lines of railroads,
highways, streets, alleys or easements, or the boundary lines of sections,
quarter sections, divisions of sections, tracts or lots, or such lines extended
otherwise indicated.
   (b)   In areas not subdivided into lots and blocks, wherever a district is
indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling a street or highway, the depth
of such strips shall be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the maps
measured at right angles from the center line of the street or highway, and the
length of frontage shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the map from
section, quarter section or division lines, or center lines of streets,
highways or railroad rights of way unless otherwise indicated.
   (c)   Where a lot held in one ownership and of record on the effective date
of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67, passed November 20, 1967) is divided by a
district boundary line, the entire lot shall be construed to be within the less
restricted district, provided that this construction shall not apply if it
increases the less restricted frontage of the lot by more than twenty-five
feet.
      (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)

not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone
as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, public ways or
waterways and railroad rights of way. Where the center line of a street, alley,
public way, waterway or railroad right of way serves as a district boundary,
the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be
deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to the center line.

1123.01 PURPOSE.
   The F-1 District is created to protect the public health and to reduce the
financial burdens imposed on the City, its governmental units and its
individuals, which may result from improper use of lands having excessively
high water tables or are subject to frequent and periodic floods. The
boundaries of this district have been determined from the data in the office of
the Division of Water, Ohio Department of Natural Resources. As such lands are
adequately drained or sufficiently protected from the risk of overflow they
shall be removed from the Flood Plain District and reclassified into an
appropriate use district. Such determination and reclassification shall be made
by Council in accordance with Chapter
1115.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1123.02 PERMITTED USES.
   In the F-1 District the following uses are permitted:
   (a)    Open-type uses, such as loading and unloading areas, parking lots,
storage of motor vehicles, new and used, for not more than twenty-four hour
periods, and gardens, auxiliary to uses permitted in any adjoining district.
   (b)    Storage yards for equipment and materials in movable containers and
not subject to major damage by flood, provided such uses are permitted in an
adjoining district, but not including acids, caustics, flammable liquids,
trash, rags, bottles, scrap metal or any other materials commonly referred to
as "junk."
   (c)    Open-type public and private recreational facilities, such as public
parks, forest preserves, golf clubs, golf driving ranges, drive-in theaters,
recreational lakes and other similar recreational uses, subject to all other
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)    Agricultural uses, including farming, grazing and livestock raising,
provided such uses are permitted in an adjoining district.
   (e)    Any other uses customarily accessory or incidental to the above uses.
   (f)    Planned single-family residential developments in unsubdivided areas
only, provided that subsequent conditions of use have been satisfied.
   (g)    Single-family residences on lots of record prior to the effective
date of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67, passed November 20, 1967), provided
that subsequent conditions of use have been satisfied.
      (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1123.03 CONDITIONS OF USE.
   In F-1 Districts, the following conditions of use shall pertain:
   (a)    No filling of land shall be permitted except where approved by the
Planning Commission and subject to such conditions as may be stipulated to
protect the public interest.
   (b)    The natural drainage grade shall not be substantially altered.
   (c)    Any structures permitted shall be placed on the lot so as to offer
the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be firmly anchored to
prevent the structure from floating away and thus threatening to further
restrict bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream.
   (d)    Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographic data,
engineering and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding
on a proposed structure or the effect of the structure on the flow of water,
the Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such data or other
studies prepared by competent engineers or other technicians.
   (e)    All uses permitted shall be subject to approval of the Planning
Commission and to such conditions as may be stipulated to protect the public
interest.
   (f)    No basement or other floor shall be constructed below ground level.
   (g)    Planned single-family residential developments, where permitted,
shall contain adequate storm drainage or other facilities capable of protecting
the area from flooding.
   (h)    All planned single-family residential developments shall be subject
to the final approval of the City, based on recommendations from the Planning
Commission that all of the requirements of this chapter have been complied
with.
   (i)    No building or structure shall be erected and no existing building or
structure shall be moved unless the main floor elevation of the building or
structure is established with a finished floor elevation not less than three
feet above the highest known flood elevation.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1123.04 FLOOD PLAIN FRINGE AREAS.

   (a)    No basement floor or other floor shall be constructed below or at a
lower elevation than the main floor.
   (b)    Land may be filled within the flood plain fringe areas provided such
fill shall extend at least twenty-five feet beyond the limits of any structure
erected thereon.
   (c)    Foundations of all structures shall be designed to withstand flood
conditions at the site.

of a Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (g)   The Review Board is obligated to act as quickly as possible on all
applications so as to cause as little inconvenience to the owner or user as is
possible and shall attempt, where the proposed sign, change or landscaping is
inappropriate, to keep the waiting period as brief as it may be so long as the
owner or user negotiates with the Review Board in good faith. Where a
recommendation of disapproval is made to the Planning Commission, the reasons
shall be set forth in writing.

1149.10 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES OF
APPROPRIATENESS.   .
   (a)    In considering the appropriateness of any environmental changes,
including signs and landscaping, the Review Board shall take into account, in
addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural style
and general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the proposed
change as they relate to the property in its present condition and shall also
consider the relation thereof to the same or related factors in other
properties, objects and areas in the immediate vicinity.
   (b)    Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect
often created by the clash of undisguised contemporary materials such as
aluminum or other metals, plastic, fiberglass, and glass improperly used with
brick, stone, masonry and wood.
   (c)    The Review Board shall favor the use of authentic and traditional
earth colors and trim colors as opposed to colors of contemporary origin.
   (d)    The Review Board shall refer to guidelines for design review for new
construction, reconstruction, alteration and tree removal recommended by
recognized professional organizations, as made known in their publications,
including the American Society of Planning Officials, the American Institute of
Planners, the American Institute of Architects or other appropriate agencies or
organizations.
   (e)    The Review Board shall consider the advice of those consultants whose

maintenance or repair of any property, area or object within a preservation
district or otherwise listed under the provisions of this chapter, provided
such work involves no change in material, design, texture, color or outer
appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
environmental change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition of any feature which in the view of the proper authority acting
lawfully is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous
condition. However, no demolition permit shall issue, except upon certification
of a registered professional engineer, that the structure is unsound or would
need major reinforcement to be brought under building code structural
requirements, considering a use that the building would reasonably lend itself
to.

building or on the same parcel of land.
   (d)    A building or structure which is nonconforming with respect to yards,
floor area ratio, or any other element of bulk shall not be altered or expanded
in any manner which would increase the degree or extent of the nonconformity

1155.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of
public streets and so promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for off-street parking, loading and unloading
of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is put.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.02 APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS.
   The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall
apply as follows:
   (a)    For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67,
passed November 20, 1967), accessory parking and loading facilities shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which such buildings
or uses are located. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to
the effective date of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67, passed November 20,
1967), and provided that construction is begun within one year of such
effective date, and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading
facilities as required hereinafter need not be provided.
   (b)    When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
   However, no building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this section shall be required to
provide such additional parking or loading facilities unless and until the
aggregate increase in unit of measurement shall equal not less than fifteen
percent of the unit of measurement existing upon the effective date of this
section, in which event parking or loading facilities as required herein shall
be provided for the total increase.
   (c)    Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall be changed
hereafter to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if the building or structure was erected
prior to the effective date of this section, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.03 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   Accessory off-street parking or loading facilities which are located on the
same lot as the building or use served and which were in existence on the
effective date of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67, passed November 20, 1967)
or were provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below, the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance for a similar new building or use.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.04 PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing
use of land or buildings provided that all regulations herein governing the
location, design, improvement and operation of such facilities are adhered to.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.05 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.
   For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use which is in
existence on the effective date of this section (Ordinance 10-16-67, passed
November 20, 1967), which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire,
collapse, explosion or other cause, and which is reconstructed, re-established
or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any
maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or
continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this
Zoning Ordinance for equivalent new uses or construction.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.06 CONTROL OF OFF-SITE PARKING FACILITIES.
   When required parking facilities are provided on land other than the zoning
lot on which the building or use served by such facilities is located, they
shall be and remain in the same possession or ownership as the zoning lot
occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory.
No such off-site parking facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit
shall be issued where the plans call for parking facilities other than on the
same zoning lot until the Zoning Board of Appeals has reviewed the plans and
heard the applicant and made findings that the common ownership or possession
of the zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain
to continue and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all
times during the life of the proposed use or building.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.07 SUBMISSION OF PLOT PLAN.
   Any application for a building permit, or for a certificate of occupancy
where no building permit is required, shall include therewith a plot plan,
drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities
to be provided in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed
11-20-67.)
1155.08 USE OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking facilities accessory to residential use and developed in
any residential district in accordance with the requirements of this section
shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by
occupants of the dwelling structures to which such facilities are accessory or
by guests of the occupants. Under no circumstances shall required parking
facilities accessory to residential structures be used for the storage of
commercial vehicles or for the parking of automobiles belonging to the
employees, owners, tenants, visitors or customers of business or manufacturing
establishments.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.09 JOINT PARKING FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses,
or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively in any zoning district in which
separate parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted,
provided that the total number of spaces so located together shall not be less
than the sum of the separate requirements for each use.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.10 COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by
this Zoning Ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of
one-half shall be counted as one parking space. (Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-
67.)
1155.11 SIZE OF EACH PARKING S PAC E.
   A required off-street parking space shall be at least eight and one-half
feet in width and at least twenty feet in length, exclusive of access drives or

vertical clearance of at least seven feet.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)
1155.12 ACCESS TO PARKING SPACES.
   Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or
driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of
vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street parking facilities shall
be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in
a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements. No driveway across
public property nor curb cut shall exceed a width of thirty feet.

sky except when otherwise allowed as a special exception.
   
   (b)    Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, except a single parking
space accessory to a one-family dwelling, shall be improved with a compacted

any institutional premises, by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge
not less than five feet nor more than seven feet in height. Such required
screening shall conform with the front and side yard setback requirements of
the district in which the parking is located.
   (d)    Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be directed away from residential properties in such a way as not to

any residence district.
(Ord. 10-16-67. Passed 11-20-67.)

1178.01   General information and procedures.
1178.02   Street design standards.
1178.03   Storm water runoff and flows.
1178.04   Storm water conveyance systems.
1178.05   Storm water control measures.
1178.06   Erosion and sediment control.
1178.07   Utility improvements.
1178.01 GENERAL INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited and referred
to as the "Subdivision Design Standards, Village of Waverly, Ohio (Village),"
and shall hereinafter be referred to as "Standards."
   (b)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of good subdivision and land development site design is
to:
         A.   Create a functional and attractive development, minimize adverse
impacts, and ensure that a project will be an asset to the Village. To promote
this purpose, the subdivision and/or land development shall conform to these
Standards that are intended to result in a well-planned community without
adding undue burden on the Owner/Developer.
         B.   Enact design controls that shall help insure the creation of
convenient and safe streets, usable lots, spaces for public purpose, and will
minimize the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard growth.
         C.   To protect property from flood damage and channel erosion and to
protect water resources from degradation resulting from accelerated storm water
flows.
         D.   Ensure access to public utilities to help sustain a healthy and
comfortable living and/or working environment for residential, commercial, and
industrial develop alike.
         E.   Construct municipal systems which allow for cost efficient
maintenance and to not create undue burden fiscally. Facilities shall safe and
convenient access to the constructed infrastructure for maintenance.
      (2)   The Village Planning Commission (Planning Commission) has the
responsibility for reviewing the design of each subdivision from early in the
design development process for approval of the project plans to help insure
that all the requirements of these Standards are addressed. However, the burden
is solely placed upon the Owner/Developer to adhere to all Standards whether or
not specifically identified by the Planning Commission during project review
and approval.
   (c)   Applicability.
      (1)   This document applies to the design of residential, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions located within the Village of Waverly and its
jurisdictional areas as it pertains to minimum design Standards for streets,
storm water runoff and flows, storm water conveyance measures, storm water
control measures, erosion control, site utilities, and related standard
drawings and reference design criteria.
      (2)   Storm water management standards are included herein for use in
reference to single lot commercial, industrial, and/or multi-family residential
developments where the a single entity or group owns the property and the
improvements are privately owned and maintained rather than publicly owned and
maintained. These Standards shall apply.
   (d)   Minimum Standards.
      (1)   This document establishes the minimum Standards for improvements
and construction required for the infrastructure associated within a
subdivision and other forms of land development. All infrastructure
improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with these
Standards and any other applicable standards and regulations as determined by
the Village. It is the intent of this regulation to provide minimum guidelines
as to the infrastructure required for land development. It is not intended to
be comprehensive and detailed with regard to the general engineering practices
required for implementation or a step by step procedural guide. It is the sole
responsible of the professional designer to identify, employ, and execute the
engineering tasks as required to comply with these Standards.
      (2)   In addition to these minimum Standards, consideration will be given
to innovative solutions to achieve the same end goal of quality land
development utilizing sound engineering principles as it relates to the
infrastructure systems defined herein. Review and approval of such alternative
solutions shall be granted by the Village as they deem appropriate in close
coordination with the Owner/Developer from the early conceptual review stages
of the project.
   (e)   Conformity with Proposed Plans. In the designing of infrastructure as
described herein, the Owner/Developer shall ensure that all proposed designs
for construction are prepared being cognizant of and taking into consideration
any proposed plans for improvements to public infrastructure by the Village,
Pike County, Ohio (County), or State of Ohio (State) through the alignment and
placement of proposed infrastructure and right of way widths, easements,
utilities and any other associated improvements. It is the sole responsibility
of the Owner/Developer to contact the appropriate authorities and perform due
diligence and research any proposed public improvements in the region of the
proposed development which may impact site design and infrastructure alignment.
   (f)   Suitability of Land. Land shall not be subdivided or developed for the
following causes.
      (1)   Development of land in flood designated zones contradictory to the
Village Flood Control Regulations and/or FEMA, FIRM designations.
      (2)   Being unable to obtain adequate public water supply.
      (3)   Collection of surface ground water/poor drainage which is unable to
be satisfactorily resolved.
      (4)   Inadequate traffic capacity on access roads
      (5)   Adverse rock formation or topography
      (6)   Any other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety, or
welfare of the future residents of the subdivision or the existing community
at-large. Such lands shall remain undeveloped until such time as the conditions
causing the unsuitability are corrected.
   (g)   Preservation of Land. In the subdivision of land, due regard shall be
shown for preserving and maintaining the historic nature of that portion of the
Village containing structures of historic significance or of historic
character. Also, the natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops, scenic
views, and water features shall be preserved, where possible by developing the
site to maximize the unique characteristics of the site.
   (h)   Survey Monuments. All surveys performed in relation to the subdivision
shall be performed by surveyor registered in the State of Ohio. All surveys
performed in the Village for new subdivision plats requiring the construction
of new public improvements, easements, and rights of way shall conform to the
requirements of the Pike County Engineer’s Office and as per the minimum
Standards established in the Section 4733 of the Ohio Administrative Code
(OAC).
   (i)   Inspections.  
      (1)   The Village or its designated representatives shall make periodic
inspections during the installation of improvements to verify conformity with
these Standards and other applicable regulations or as specified herein.
However, inspections performed by the Village or its representatives do not
remove the sole responsibility of the Owner/Developer or its contractors to
construct the improvements according to approved specifications, regulatory
permits, or to make the necessary field adjustments required for proper
construction.
      (2)   Upon completion of all the improvements, the Owner/Developer and/or
his contractor shall request, in writing, a final inspection walk through with
representatives of Village and any other relevant private utilities and public
entities.
   (j)   Traffic Control. Traffic control shall be provided by the Owner/
Developer in accordance with the ODOT-Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices (OMUTCD). A traffic control plan shall be provided by the Owner/
Developer or his agent illustrating both permanent and temporary construction
traffic control plans for review and approval by the Village.
   (k)   Bonding of Improvements. The bonding of construction associated with
the improvements as included in this Standard shall be in accordance with Title
Seven, Section
1169.08 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Waverly.

1178.02 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   All materials and construction methods shall be performed in the
manner prescribed in the current edition of the ODOT, CMS to the extent
necessary to secure the improvements consistent with the intent of these
Standards or where no other specifications are provided herein.
      (2)   For all materials utilized for roadway and street construction, the
materials supply (i.e. quarry, batch plant, or ready mix) shall provide
verification that the materials being produced and provided for this project
meet ODOT materials specifications for the specific material being provided for
each application.
      (3)   All roadways and streets (streets) within a new subdivision shall
be constructed or improved to comply with the Standards shown or referenced
herein.
      (4)   All streets shall be designed in substantial relation to existing
and proposed topographic conditions and drainage, for public convenience and
safety, and to facilitate the proposed uses of land to be served by such
streets. A public street shall be provided for convenient access to all
property within the subdivision. The Owner/Developer shall provide within the
boundaries of the subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the
widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the
State or local thoroughfare plans or other proposed improvements as applicable.
      (5)   Pavement widths and thickness shall be as shown and specified in
the roadway typical sections as provided in
Appendix A - Typical Sections and
Appendix B - Minimum Street Design Standards for the applicable thoroughfare
type.
      (6)   Construction shall be accomplished in such a manner that cutting of
the finished pavement will not be required for utility easements/construction.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   This section applies to the design streets and related improvements
for residential, commercial, and industrial subdivisions located within the
Village of Waverly.
   (c)   Materials Testing.
      (1)   All material testing is the responsibility of the Owner/Developer
or his contractor. Testing shall be performed by an independent and qualified
geotechnical firm to insure conformity with these Standards. The geotechnical
firm to provide the independent testing shall be approved by the Village before
any testing occurs. The geotechnical consultant will determine the maximum dry
density and percent of compaction for all earth work. While embankment
operations are being conducted, the geotechnical firm shall visit the site no
less than twice each day (morning and afternoon) to perform necessary
compaction tests. The contractor is responsible for supplying the Village with
copies of the test results weekly. From October 1 to April 15, compaction tests
on subgrade are required but may be requested anytime during the year by the
Village if they have determined that the tests are needed or if subgrade is
questionable.
      (2)   Asphalt testing and pavement coring will be the responsibility of
the contractor at the discretion of and as requested by the Village should it
be deemed necessary for compliance of the material constructed relative to the
approved specifications.
   (d)   Classification.
      (1)   Determination.
         A.   The Owner/Developer and their agents shall provide an initial
determination of the street classification in accordance with these Standards.
         B.   The Planning Commission in consultation with the Village Engineer
shall make the final determination as to the classification of any new street
relative to its placement with the proposed subdivision and surrounding
community, on the potential development of the site, its potential traffic
volume, expressed in ADT (Average Daily Traffic), the character of the
surrounding area, and any plans either proposed or future for roadway
development by local, county, state, or federal entities.
         C.   The Village reserves the right to request that traffic count
information or a traffic impact study is be performed and provided to the
Village for their review and consideration.
      (2)   Types.
         A.   Arterial. Streets utilized primarily for the movement of people
and goods rather than access to adjacent land uses. Arterial streets serve a
community wide function and are, therefore, designated using a broader
perspective. Arterials are not planned on a subdivision level since the result
would be discontinuity and a breakdown in the street’s regional function.
Therefore, Arterial Street Standards fall outside of the scope of these
regulations. When required, an Arterial street shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the appropriate federal, state, or local
governing agencies and in close coordination with and approval by the Village.
         B.   Collector. A collector street is a thoroughfare which functions
as a feeder from an area of limited traffic to a major street or highway. The
main access to the development from an arterial or another collector. Average
Daily Traffic (ADT) for a Collector is approximately 1,000 to 3,000 vehicles
per day.
         C.   Local Street. A local street is primarily used to gain access to
the property adjoining it. Local streets are generally utilized in subdivision
to traverse to a specific point in the development rather than through the
development including loop roadways. A local street may be either urban or
rural as defined herein. The ADT for a Local street is approximately 1,000
vehicles per day or less.
         D.   Cul-de-sac. A permanently constructed dead-end street with a
circular area for turning around.
         E.   Knuckles. A street configuration utilized to turn a single street
900 without other intersecting streets. Knuckles shall not be permitted.
         F.   Private Streets. Any passageway designed for use by motor powered
vehicles, upon property owned by one or more persons, firms or corporations
where such passageway serves as ingress/egress to the parcels and the roadway
has not been accepted into the public system and is maintained by the owners
upon which the roadway is located. Private streets are prohibited from being
developed as a part of a proposed subdivision (Major, Minor, or Non-
Residential).
      (3)   Character. See Section
1178.02(d)(2) hereof for a description of the various street classification
types (collector, local, and cul-de-sac). The character of a proposed
development (urban or rural) shall be determined with regard to the existing
physical conditions in the area of, the configuration of the proposed land
development, and proposed lot size. See
Appendix A for illustrations of the infrastructure associated with an Urban
Street and Local Streets for the various street types as described above. See
also Title Seven, Sections
1166.02 and
1171.05 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Waverly for definitions
and additional information.
         A.   Urban. Urban Streets may be residential, commercial, or
industrial in nature. All commercial or industrial development shall be
considered Urban unless specifically designated otherwise by the Village of
Waverly. Urban Developments are generally located in close proximity to main
thoroughfares, near the business district, residential areas of relatively high
density, or serving a proposed commercial establishment or industrial complex.
For purposes of these Standards, Urban Streets shall include, but are not
limited to, curb and gutter sections and sidewalks. In a residential Urban
Development, the lot size shall be less than 1.0 acres and with a roadway
frontage of less than 200.00 feet along the adjoining street.
         B.   Rural. A Rural Street shall be designated as such when
intersecting an existing State, County, or Local street or roadway in low
population density areas and utilizing open ditch drainage storm water
conveyance. A Rural Development shall be a proposed development with lot
frontages of 200.00 feet or greater and a lot size of 1.0 acres or greater.
Utilization of a Rural Street typical section shall be as approved by the
Village contingent upon the existing natural character of the land to be
developed, the adjoining parcels, and the dimensional criteria listed above.
   (e)   Typical Sections & Design Tables.
      (1)   See the Typical Sections located in
Appendix A for reference as to the construction material placement, thickness,
and configuration for streets for the various street types of such character as

all organic material to a depth of 24-inches below the surface of the subgrade
and to a width of 18-inches beyond the edge of the surface of the pavement or
to the back of the curb and gutter. Soft clay and other unsuitable material
shall be cleared to a depth as determined by the Village. Bridging of
unsuitable material must be approved by the Village or designated
representative, prior to construction of and compaction of the subgrade.
      (2)   The subgrade surface shall be compacted to not less than 98% of the
maximum dry density of the compacted soil (standard proctor) and sealed by
using a steel drum roller with a minimum compaction rate of 10 tons. As an
alternative, a loaded tandem axle truck or pan shall be utilized to proof roll
the subgrade, which shall be witnessed and approved by the Village or
designated representative.
   (j)   Roadway Base. The following Standards apply to roadway/street base.
      (1)   Asphalt Concrete Base. The basis for this specification is ODOT
Item 301 and must meet ODOT gradation and bitumen content (4% to 8%). The

The minimum surface temperature of subgrade is to be 360 F when paving 3 to 6
inches in depth. Base may not be placed on soft and/or frozen subgrade.
      (2)   Aggregate Base. The basis for this specification is ODOT Item 304
and must meet ODOT gradation. The maximum compacted layer (lift) shall be 6
inches. Water will be added to bring the base to optimum moisture prior to
compaction. Roadway sections utilizing Item 304 Aggregate Base may require the
use of Item 605 - Shallow Pipe Under drains to adequately drain the aggregate
base. The Village reserves the right to require the use of an aggregate base
typical section with undrains in areas that exhibit poor drainage.

leveling course shall not be placed the same day as the bituminous aggregate
base.
      (2)   Asphalt Concrete Intermediate Course, Type 2 - The basis for this
specification is ODOT Item 448, Type 2, PG64-22. This item shall be used as a
leveling course between the base and the final asphalt surface course. The
composition must meet ODOT gradation and bitumen content. The minimum and
maximum depth of any one layer shall be as shown on the typical sections
located in
Appendix A and the Design Tables located in
Appendix B. The minimum surface temperature shall be 400F. The asphalt-leveling
course shall not be placed the same day as the bituminous aggregate base.
      (3)   Asphalt Concrete Surface Course, Type 1 - The basis for this
specification is ODOT Item 448 Asphalt Concrete Surface Course, Type 1, PG64-
22. This item shall be used as a final asphalt wearing course. The composition
must meet ODOT gradation and bitumen content. The minimum and maximum depth of
any one layer shall be as shown on the typical sections located in
Appendix A and the Design Tables located in
Appendix B. The surface temperature shall to be 500F or greater prior to the
placement of any asphalt. A tack coat must be placed between the leveling and
final wearing course at a rate of 0.10 gal/square yard and along the face of
curb. If the surface course is not installed within one week of the leveling
course installation, the leveling course must be pressure washed before the
finish course is applied to ensure a clean and cohesive surface.
The Owner/Developer and the Village, at the discretion of the Village, will
discuss the anticipated build-out or development of the subdivision. Should a
relatively rapid build-out be anticipated, the contractor may be required to
wait a minimum of one year before applying the finish course of asphalt to
allow for building construction wear as determined by the Village.
   (l)   Rigid Pavement. For commercial and/or industrial developments, the
Owner/Developer may choose to utilize a rigid pavement section as approved by
the Village. A pavement design based upon ODOT design Standards shall be
submitted to the Village for approval based upon the projected traffic loadings
and frequency. Concrete pavement shall not be used with non-curb and gutter
sections.
   The following Standards apply to rigid pavement.
      (1)   Reinforced Portland Cement Concrete Pavement. The basis for this
specification is ODOT Item 451. This item will consist of a single course of
pavement composed of Reinforced Portland Cement Concrete. The composition of
all materials and construction must be in accordance with the current
specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation for Reinforced Portland
Cement Concrete Pavement. In order to facilitate proper placement it is
required that at least fifty percent (50%) of the concrete finishers on site
will be ACI certified concrete finishers.
      (2)   Concrete Pavement Design. All concrete pavements shall be designed
according to ODOT, Pavement Design and Rehabilitation Manual, current edition
and the ODOT, CMS.
   (m)   Miscellaneous Design Standards. The street design tables as contained

of mobility, physical and cognitive skills, disabilities, and impairments. The
sidewalk shall be a clear or an unobstructed pedestrian travel way. In plan
preparation, the design engineer shall be cognizant of the three dimensional
corridor which makes up an accessible route and attempt to locate utilities,
light poles, signs, fire hydrants, mail boxes, parking meters and street
furniture (benches, shelters, bike racks, etc.) outside of this sidewalk
corridor.
      (2)   Requirement. Sidewalks shall be required on all roadways with a
curb and gutter roadway typical section. Sidewalks are not required on roadways
of a rural character unless specifically required otherwise by the Village.
When no sidewalks are required, a paved pedestrian connection path shall be
required on one side of the roadway connecting the streets of the subdivision.
The paved path may be located to the front of the lots except where terrain
dictates or in order to maximize the natural landscape. When outside of the
right-of-way, an easement ten (10) feet in width shall be provided for use of
pedestrian path by all.
      (3)   Width. The minimum recommended sidewalk or pedestrian path width is
4 feet.
      (4)   Buffer. A buffer width, also known as a tree lawn or planting
strip, is the distance between the sidewalk and the adjacent roadway which
improves pedestrian safety. Buffer width is measured from the face of curb to
the front edge of the sidewalk. If a buffer strip cannot be provided in a
commercial or industrial street, then the curb-attached sidewalk width should
be at least 7 ft. wide to provide space for light poles, street tree wells,
street furniture, and to improve pedestrian safety. All roadways with curb
attached sidewalks or buffers should be constructed with vertical curbing.
      (5)   Grade and Slope. Sidewalks and walkways should be designed with
maximum grades of five (5) percent for accessibility. The only exception is
when the topography of an area dictates the adjacent road grade steeper than 5%
and there is no other alternative alignment for the sidewalk. Sidewalks should
be constructed with a maximum cross slope of 2%. The cross slope is the slope
that is measured perpendicular to the direction of travel.
      (6)   Typical Sections. See
Appendix A, Typical Sections for applicability relative to roadway type.
Sidewalks shall be placed within the public right-of-way. The top edge of the
sidewalk closest to the curb shall be set a minimum of 1 inch per foot from the
top of the curb with the slope dependent upon the varying distance from the
curb to the sidewalk. Sidewalk shall be poured on a compacted and approved base
per ODOT Item 608.
   (s)   Curb Ramps. Curb ramps are required on all curb and gutter streets
with sidewalks and shall conform to ODOT L&D Manual, Volume I, Section 306.3
and ODOT, Standard Details.
      (1)   Requirement. Section 729.12 of the Ohio Revised Code requires that
all new or reconstructed curbs shall have curb ramps at each pedestrian
crosswalk so that the sidewalk and street blend to a common level. All curb
ramps must be ADA compliant and constructed as per ODOT Standards.
      (2)   Location. A continuous path is to be provided for the persons with
disabilities. When a curb ramp is built on one side of a street, a companion
curb ramp is required on the opposite side of the street. The basic requirement
is that a crosswalk must be accessible via curb ramps from both ends, not one
end only. Curb ramps will be installed in all quadrants of an intersection.
      (3)   Design. Curb ramps should be designed to the least slope consistent
with the curb height, available corner area and underlying topography. A level
landing is necessary for turning, maneuvering or bypassing the sloped surface.
Proper curb ramp design is important to users either continuing along a
sidewalk path or attempting to cross the street.
      (4)   Detectable Warnings. Detectable warnings are standardized surface
features on walking surfaces to warn visually impaired people of the transition
between the sidewalk and the street. Truncated domes are specified as the
detectable warnings to be used and are to be included in all connections to all
street crossings to mark the street edge, where a sidewalk crosses a vehicular
way.
   (t)   Concrete. All concrete shall be Class "C" in accordance with ODOT Item
609.02. The minimum air temperature for concrete poured at ground level
(sidewalk, apron, and curb) is to be 320 F. Concrete may not be poured on
frozen base or subgrade. Concrete must be protected from freezing for 7 days
after pouring. No more than 1.5-% calcium may be added to accelerate setup
time. Curing compound is applied at 1 gallon /150 sq. ft. The class "C" mixed
concrete must obtain a minimum strength of 4000 lbs. per sq. inch after 28 days
using compression test. Concrete testing will be the responsibility of the
Owner/Developer or his contractor and shall be performed by an independent
testing laboratory approved by the Village. The Village shall be provided a
copy of all test results immediately upon publish and be made aware of any
deficiencies in concrete strength relative to the Standards.
   (u)   Signage.
      (1)   Signs shall conform to and be placed in accordance with the Ohio
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD).
      (2)   Stop signs and street name signs must be erected prior to any
residential/commercial construction.
      (3)   The Owner/Developer is responsible to install all stop signs and
street name signs on newly constructed roads in accordance with Village
Standards. The Owner/Developer shall contact and coordinate the installation of
the signage with the Village prior to commencing installation.
   (v)   Pavement Markings.
      (1)   When pavement markings are required, it shall be the responsibility
of the Owner/Developer to complete. Pavement markings are required for turn
lanes and for a street wider than 24-feet or as required by the Village.
      (2)   All permanent pavement markings shall conform to ODOT Item 644 -
Thermoplastic Pavement Marking.
   (w)   Guardrail. Guardrail installation shall consist of placing steel beam,
ODOT Types 4, 5, 5-A and Type 5 with tubular backup guardrail at such places
where the roadway embankment areas are more than 5-feet deep and/or with
steeper than 4:1 slopes. Type B anchor assembly with flares shall be used. The
Village reserves the right to require guardrail installation in other areas
they determine the proposed street to create a safety hazard to the traveling
public or to existing structures located near the roadway.
(Ord. 65-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
1178.03 STORM WATER RUNOFF AND FLOWS.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   The hydraulics and hydrology utilized to analyze and design storm
water management systems and related appurtenances shall be in accordance with
the guidelines and regulations as contained in the most current edition of the
ODOT, L&D, Volume II.
      (2)   A Storm water Design Report shall be prepared and submitted to the
Village containing the design calculations and illustrations for the proposed
development. This report shall include, but is not limited to, calculations
pertaining to the pre and post development watershed basins and sub-basins,
hydrologic and hydraulic systems, structures, culverts & pipelines, control
structures, erosion & sediment control, water quantity and quality (as
applicable) control facilities, and any other information/calculations
pertinent to storm water runoff and system design.
      (3)   The format of the Storm water Design Report shall be at the
discretion of the design engineer in so much as it is in a logical, neat and an
orderly manner. The Village reserves the right to request additional
documentation not included in the design report as submitted and as it deems
necessary.
   (b)   Applicability. This section applies subdivision development regarding
the design methodologies to be utilized in computing storm water runoff and
flows associated with the existing and proposed surface and subsurface
characteristics of the site, and the hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
necessary. This section also applies to the storm water design of single lot
commercial, industrial, and multi-family residential developments unless
otherwise modified by subsequent sections of this Standard.
   (c)   Drainage Area Properties.
      (1)   Existing Conditions. The design of storm water management
infrastructure including open ditches, channels, storm sewers, culverts,
bridges, water quantity/quality control structures, or other facilities begins
with examination and identification of the existing physical conditions and
properties of the area to be developed and adjoining area which may be
tributary to the watershed or a part of the off-site portion of the watershed.
This examination and site reconnaissance shall include:
         A.   Flood Boundaries.
            1.   The estimated 100-year and 500-year flood plain limits and
elevations in or near the watershed including the estimated flood way location,
shall be shown on the existing site plan. The designer shall be cognizant of
these flood limits in site design and layout.
            2.   Should the project limits fall within or adjoin any of the
flood plains or the floodway as referenced above, a permit shall be obtained
from the local Flood Plain Manager for the Village, located in the Mayor’s
Office in full compliance to the Flood Plain Regulations.
            3.   Flood boundary information is to be obtained from the most
recent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for the subject area.
            4.   Additionally, contact is to be made with the United States
Army Corps of Engineer (USACE), Huntington District, regarding Flood Profiles
for the waterway in question for any flood study data which may be available.
         B.   Topography. A land survey which provides data points and contour
lines of like elevations is to be prepared and utilized for delineation of the
existing watershed, drainage basins, and subbasins. For preliminary site
analysis or off-site drainage areas which may contribute to the storm drainage
of the project, aerial photography and topographic mapping is available through
the Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Project (OGRIP) http://
ogrip.oit.ohio.gov/.
         C.   Subsurface Conditions. Utilizing a USDA, NRCS Soils Report for
Pike County, Ohio the soil types located within the watershed are illustrated
to be utilized in development of the existing and proposed storm water runoff
flow rates for the site. This information may also be used to aid in design of
water quality features utilizing subsurface infiltration or basins dependent
upon impermeable soils as a natural bottom liner. Custom soils survey reports
and maps may be created from the USDA, NRCS at http://
websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/.
         D.   Natural Features. The location and/or limits of other natural
features shall be noted which may impact the site design such as the presents
of wetlands, stands of mature trees, or wild life habitat area. Wetlands
disturbance shall not be permitted without a wetland delineation by an
environmental scientist trained in USACE procedures and permitted. A 401/404
permit from the USACE shall also be required prior to any disturbance. It is
strongly recommended that should hydrophilic flora, fauna, and/or boggy
depressions are discovered; that the area is entirely avoided by the proposed
development and no additional storm water runoff is directed toward this
natural feature.
      (2)   Water Shed Delineation.
         A.   Existing (Predevelopment). - Given the topographic mapping and
other existing physical features, a delineation of the existing watershed shall
be made including the drainage basins and sub-basins as appropriate.
         B.   Proposed (Post Development). - The Post-Development watershed,
drainage basins, and sub-basins are developed in a matter similar to the
Predevelopment, however, the proposed site grading plan and initial
approximations of the storm water infrastructure shall occur.
   (d)   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Conditions.
      (1)   Description. Many different methods are available to calculate
storm water flows. These methods range from simple calculations to complex
computer modeling. However, all methods are based upon the application of
metrological, hydrologic, and hydraulic principles to compute the estimated
storm water discharge rate for the catchment being studied.
   The methods listed below are acceptable unless approved otherwise by the
Village. The Owner/Developer has the option to utilize either of the methods
within the parameters of sound engineering practice and based upon the specific
application. The Village reserves the right to request calculations utilizing
the method not selected as a check of the results calculated, as they deem
appropriate.
         A.   Hydrologic Methods
               Rational
               SCS, TR-55
               Other (as approved)
      (2)   Rational Method.
         A.   Land Type. This method is recommended for small, primarily
existing urban areas, with a relatively high percentage of impervious surfaces.
The total water shed area, including offsite drainage, shall be less than 200
acres. Under such conditions, the Rational Method typically produces relatively
accurate storm water runoff results.
This method determines the peak rate of runoff for all design frequencies
selected. The Rational Method calculates flow as follows:
   Q=CiA;    Where:
         Q = Peak rate of runoff, (cfs)
         C = Coefficient of runoff
         I = Intensity of rainfall for the selected storm frequency, duration
          (in/hr)
         A = Drainage area, (acres)
         B.   Coefficient of Runoff, C. This is a dimension less decimal value
that estimates the percentage of rainfall that becomes runoff. The C value can
be considered as a lump sum parameter that accounts for abstractions,
antecedent moisture conditions, and other variables affecting the runoff rate.
See the Table 1 for a range of values for the various contributing surfaces
which are acceptable.

Adapted from the Standard Handbook for Civil Engineer - Fourth Edition, 1996
When a single catchment area consists of several areas with different C
coefficients, a weighed coefficient shall be computed and represented as
follows:
Cw = [https://export.amlegal.com/media/
8037483eb7768ea7c19b1e69928fc1f78ae005f0/IMAGES/0-0-0-3383.jpg] (CA) / Area
(TOTAL)
Since the rational formula assumes as constant uniform rainfall for the time of
concentration over the entire area, the area (A) to which the Runoff
Coefficient (C) is applied is to be selected as precisely as possible.
         C.   Time of Concentration. The time of concentration is the estimated
time that it takes runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point
of the watershed to a point of concentration such as a culvert, catch basin, or
ditch checkpoint. The time of concentration is computed by the summation of the
runoff time of travel across the various components of the watershed. Runoff is
delivered to the impoundment or discharge area by one of three methods:
overland flow, shallow concentrated flow, and open channel flow or a
combination of these three.
         D.   Overland Flow. Overland or sheet flow is flow over a plan
surface. It usually occurs in the headwater of streams and is generally
restricted to no greater than 100-feet. Sheet flow travel time is computed by
the following Manning’s kinematic equation.
            TO = 1.8(1.1-C)(L) 0.5) / (S 0.333)
   
            Where:
            
            TO = travel time of overland flow, (minutes)
            C = Coefficient of Runoff
            L = Distance to most remote location in drainage area, (ft) (300-ft
Max)
            S = Overland slope (%)
Note that these methods shall not be used to determine time of travel for
gutter, swale, or ditch flow.
         E.   Shallow Concentrated Flow. After a maximum of 100-ft of flow,
overland flow generally becomes shallow concentrated flow. The velocity of
shallow concentrated flow can be estimated using the following relationship:
            TS = L / 60V
            Where:
            TS = travel time for shallow concentrated flow, (minutes)
            L = Length of Flow (ft)
            V = Velocity (ft/s) - (from equation below)
            The velocity for shallow concentrated flow is computed by:
            V = 3.281ks(0.5)
                  
            Where:
            V = Velocity (fps)
            k = Intercept coefficient - See Table 2 below
            s = overland slope (%)
Table 2. Intercept Coefficients, C
Type of Surface                      Intercept Coefficient, k
Forest with heavy ground litter      0.076
Minimum tillage cultivated, woodland 0.152
Short grass pasture                  0.213
Cultivated straight row              0.274
Poor grass, untilled                 0.305
Grassed waterways                    0.457
Unpaved area; bare soil              0.491
Paved area                           0.619
Adapted from the ODOT, L&D Manual, Volume II - Table 1101-1
Shallow concentrated flow generally terminates at a defined carrier such as a
ditch, channel, or pipe system.
         F.   Channelized / Piped Flow. The velocity in open channel flow or
piping system is computed by the Manning’s equation as:
            V = (1.486 r 0.67 s 0.5)/n
            Where:
            V = average velocity (ft/s)
            n = Manning’s roughness coefficient for open channel flow or pipe
            r = hydraulic radius (ft)
            s = slope of hydraulic grade line or channel slope (ft/ft)
Manning roughness coefficient, n, represents frictional losses due to the
physical character of the channel bottom or conduit material type. Manning’s n
value is obtained from various technical resources.
            Channelized/Pipe Flow Travel Time
            Td = L / 60V
            Where:
            Td = travel time for channel/pipe flow, (minutes)
            L = Length of Flow (ft)
            V = Velocity (ft/s) - V (from equation above)
The time of concentration is the summation of the travel times for the various
land surfaces described. This process is reiterated for each sub-basin within
the catchment to determine the time of concentration for the catchment. The
time of concentration is also equivalent to the duration of the storm.
         G.   Rainfall Intensity. Knowing the time of concentration (duration)
of the runoff, the intensity of the rainfall is determined utilizing Rainfall
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves. See
Appendix C for IDF Curves from the ODOT, L&D, Volume II. Utilizing the duration
for the various year storm frequency, the intensity (in/hour) is determined.
      (3)   Soil Conservation Service, Technical Release No. 55.
         A.   “Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds”, the SCS-TR55 program is
intended for examination of drainage areas which are more rural in character
but urbanizing. The methods of SCS TR-55 shall be used to determine the peak
rate of runoff in such areas. Additionally, when utilized for design for
drainage systems, including offsite drainage, greater than 200 acres the SCS-
TR55 method generally produces more accurate results than the Rational Method.
         B.   Given the advent of computerized models, the SCS-TR55 Method is
available in a windows based computer model, WinTR-55 for calculation of runoff
and flow rate given the input parameters associated with the location of the
site and the hydrologic properties of the site and properties regarding the
components used to calculate the time of concentration.
For the purposes of SCS TR-55 or WinTR-55, the following information shall be
prepared and ready for input:
            *   Units = English
            *   Area = Square acres
            *   Land use category - site dependent
            *   Soil Hydrologic Properties - (From USDA, NRCS Soil
            *   Survey)
            *   Enter flow path dimensions:
               - Sheet flow = 100-ft (maximum)
               - Shallow concentrated flow
               - Channelized flow
               - Structure Type & Size (as applicable)
               - Outlet
            *   Rainfall shall be based upon SCS Type II Rainfall Distribution
         C.   Utilizing this program, the time of concentration (Tc) is
calculated for the sub-basins indicated in place of the manual calculations as
indicated for the Rational Method. The Tc shall not be less than 10-minutes.
This program shall be executed for both the pre and post development
conditions.
      (4)   Alternate Hydrologic Methods. Alternate hydrologic methods,
utilizing one or more of the principles described above may be used in
conjunction with proprietary computer models/programs to determine peak flows
with the approval of the Village. The design engineer shall submit all
documentation necessary for the review and approval of alternate methods as
requested.

1178.05 STORM WATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   This section applies subdivision development regarding the minimum
design Standards to be utilized in designing storm water quantity control
systems and related measures. This section also applies to the storm water
control measures for single lot commercial, industrial, and multi-family
residential developments unless otherwise modified by subsequent sections of
this Standard.
      (2)   The section addresses storm water quantity control measures only as
required by these Standards. Storm water quality control is encouraged for each
site but is not required. Water quality control measures, if utilized, shall be
design in accordance with the ODOT, L&D Manual - Volume II and the ODNR, Manual
for Rainwater & Land Development.
      (3)   The Dam safety laws in the State of Ohio are regulated by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Soil and Water Conservation Office.
Dams are classified in Ohio according to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Rule
1501:21-13-01. No earthen embankment or other retention structure may be
constructed which qualifies as a Class I, II, or III Dam as defined by the OAC.
The designer shall review such regulations to ensure that the proposed
detention or retention basin falls outside the category of the ODNR facilities
requiring permitting and governance.
      (4)   It is not the intent of this section or of these Standards to
restrict the freedom of the design engineer to the methods listed herein, but
these methods are recommended for the purpose of complying with these
Standards. Innovation is encouraged when coupled with sound engineer practice.
      (5)   Proprietary storm water modeling software may be used to perform
iterative stage-storage discharge calculations to achieve the required storage
volume and allowable release rates.
   (b)   Quantity Control Design.
      (1)   Design Frequency and Storage Volume.
         A.   The Critical Storm Method as described in subsection (b)(4)
hereof shall be utilized to determine the storm frequency for the required
storage volume and allowable release rates from the quantity control facility.
Detention/Retention basins must be designed to limit the critical storm flow
out of the basin to the one (1) year pre developed rate and, also have the
capacity to store all storm frequencies greater that the critical value up to
the 100 year storm under post developed conditions and release the outflows at
the pre developed rate for like years.
         B.   The volume of storage calculated is that needed to reduce the
critical storm peak flow rate under post development conditions to equal to or
less than the two one (1) year pre development peak flow rate.
         C.   Storm water quantity control facilities shall be designed to
safely pass the 100-year storm frequency.
      (2)    Requirements.
         A.   Storm water detention or control measures are not required where
the designer can demonstrate that the proposed development will not result in
the increase in the storm water runoff volume of greater than 10% to existing
storm water conveyance feature receiving the discharge from the site.
         B.   Storm water detention shall be required when the critical storm
is equal to two (2) years or greater as defined by subsection (b)(4) hereof.
         C.   Each development shall provide for the detention of excess storm
water runoff resulting from the development. Excess storm water runoff shall
include all additional runoff resulting from increases in the impervious
surfaces of the site, including but not limited to, construction of or addition
to buildings, construction of roads and parking lots; earthwork, drainage
feature modification, elimination of naturalized or farming areas, and other
site development related activities.
         D.   If no detention is required, the storm water runoff velocity
leaving the site must be equal to or less than the one (1) year predeveloped
storm water runoff velocity.
         E.   No detention or retention shall be permitted in the public right
of way.
         F.   The designer shall provide a preliminary evaluation regarding the
necessity and general magnitude of onsite storm water detention as described in
subsection (b)(5) hereof.
         G.   As-built surveys shall be required and provided by the Owner/
Developer/owner in order to demonstrate that the facility was constructed as
illustrated on the approved plans or in accordance with field modifications as
approved by the Village of Waverly during construction. Such surveys shall be
conducted by a registered Professional Surveyor in the State of Ohio. Storm
water Control As-built surveys shall be in addition to, and separate from,
other required construction surveys and documentation. Any discrepancies
revealed in the as-constructed facilities by the as-built survey shall be
rectified by the Owner/Developer in accordance with the approved plan.
         H.   A maintenance plan for the proposed storm water control facility
shall be submitted with the design plan for review and approval by the Village.
Facility Maintenance requirements are further described the Codified Ordinances
of the Village of Waverly, Ohio of this Section.
      (3)   Runoff Control. The release point is defined as the point at which
storm water generated by the subdivision leaves the on-site storm water
conveyance or control measures and discharges into an adjoining off-site storm
water feature. The subdivision detention/retention basin and/or other storm
water management system shall be designed such that the post-development
released storm water flow emulates the predeveloped flow volume and
characteristics as it is released onto the adjacent property for the 1, 2, 5,
10, 25, 50, and 100-year storm events. No adverse effects to off-site receiving
storm water facilities shall occur as a result of the subdivision constructed.
      (4)   Critical Storm Method.
         A.   The Critical Storm value for a particular project or development
site provides the design engineer with a critical storm frequency that reflects
the changes in land surface that occurs to a particular project area after
development.
         B.   Critical storm calculations shall utilize onsite drainage areas,
only. The offsite areas are not be used in the calculation of the Critical
Storm. The offsite areas are to be used in the determination of the required
storage volume of the control basin.
         C.   Critical Storm Determination. The critical storm for a specific
development area is determined as follows.
            1.   Calculate the total volume of runoff from a 1-year, 24 hour
storm event, occurring on the development area for the predevelopment and post-
development site conditions utilizing the Rational Method or SCS-TR55 as
detailed previously. The rainfall depth utilized to calculate the 1-year, 24-
hour storm as well as the 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 year storm events is based upon
information provided by the NOAA, Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 3.0 - V 2004,
June 10, 2012 located at http://dipper.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/ for the Village
of Waverly coordinates (39.1025 N, 82.9719 W), elevation 567-feet is as
follows:
               Rainfall Depths (inches)
               •   1-year, 24 hour storm = 2.25 inches
               •   2-year, 24 hour storm = 2.69 inches
               •   5-year, 24 hour storm = 3.30 inches
               •   10-year, 24 hour storm = 3.79 inches
               •   25-year, 24 hour storm = 4.47 inches
               •   50-year, 24 hour storm = 5.02 inches
               •   100-year, 24 hour storm = 5.59 inches
            2.   The runoff volume calculated for use in determining the
Critical Storm shall pertain to on-site drainage areas only. However, any off-
site drainage areas that are tributary to the site shall be used in designing
the storm water conveyance, control systems, and other drainage improvements
for the subdivision or land development site.
            3.   Calculate the percent of increase in runoff volume due to
development.
(Post V -Pre V)/(Pre V)* 100 = % Increase in Runoff Volume
            4.   Using this percentage, select the critical storm from Table 4
below:
Table 4. Critical Storm Determination
Percent Increase in Runoff Volume      Critical Storm for Peak Rate Control
Equal to or Greater Than And Less Than
0                        10            1 year
10                       20            2 year
20                       50            5 year
50                       100           10 year
100                      250           25 year
250                      500           50 year
500                      --            100 year
Adapted from the ODNR, Soil and Water Conservation Office - Rainwater and Land
Development Manual, Third Edition 2006.
         D.   Critical Storm Controls. The Critical Storm Frequency as
determined above shall be utilized to control the peak runoff rates from storm
water control facilities.
            1.   The peak rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all more
frequent storms (less return period) occurring on the development or project
area shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm
event that would occur under predevelopment conditions. Storms of less frequent
occurrence (greater return periods) than the critical storm up to the 100-
year, 24-hour storm event shall have peak runoff rates no greater than the peak
runoff rates from equivalent size storms under predevelopment conditions.
For example, if the critical storm was calculated to be a 10-year, 24-hour
storm, the peak rate of storm water runoff that would occur from the 2, 5, and
10 year postdevelopment storms could not exceed the peak rate of runoff that
which would occur from 1-year frequency storm under predevelopment conditions.
            2.   Storms of less frequency occurrence than the critical storm up
to the 100 year, 24 hour storm shall have peak rates of runoff equal to or less
than the peak rates of runoff for the same frequency of storms under
predevelopment conditions.
            3.   A 1-year, 24 hour critical storm value does not require
detention. However, the post development outlet velocities of the storm water
system must be equal to or less than the 1-year, 24 hour predevelopment outlet
velocities.
      (5)   Preliminary Storage Estimate.
         A.   An estimate of the preliminary detention area shall be provided
and shown on preliminary plans submitted for review. This estimate shall also
aid in determination of the most appropriate storm water control means and
allocating an area on the site.
         B.   An estimate of storm water storage required may be obtained
utilizing SCS-TR55 graphic methods. An estimation of the storage volume
required may also be obtained by calculating the area on the inflow hydrograph
from the point where significant runoff begins to occur, to the peak flow rate,
and then to the target discharge control rate from the control structure. The
area contained within the limits of the inflow hydrograph as generally defined
above, provides an estimate of the storage volume required.
         C.   Subsurface soil investigations shall occur in the proposed basin
location(s) to determine if the site is suitable and to select the most
appropriate means of storm water control for the site and overall project
conditions.
         D.   Additionally, careful consideration shall be given to the site
selection for the control basin to provide the best combination of storage
requirements, site landscape and aesthetics, access to outlet and embankment
slopes for maintenance, and to minimize earth moving among other site specific
considerations.
      (6)   Control Structure Design.
         A.   Types. Multiple options are provided for achieving the required
storm water quantity control. The types listed below are acceptable control
facilities. The selection of the storm water control facility type shall be
dependent upon the existing site conditions present. Each site varies in its
design constraints and, as with other site design elements, the storm water
control facility shall be selected and designed accordingly.

and Retention Basins.
               a.   The length to width ratio of the basin shall generally be
3:1.
               b.   The inlet piping to the basin shall generally be located on
the opposite side from the discharge structure to prevent short circuiting of
inflow.
               c.   Levee embankments shall be no steeper than 3H: 1V slopes
including both sides of the levee.
               d.   When conduits are used for the outlet of the basin they
shall be protected by bar screens or other suitable provisions to prevent
blockage of the outlet.
               e.   The minimum outlet conduit shall be 1-feet in diameter.
               f.   Safety measures shall be provided for any pipe or opening
to prevent children or large animals from crawling into structures. For safety,
a suggested maximum opening is six inches for the safety grate or other safety
measure proposed.
               g.   Danger signs should be mounted at appropriate locations to
warn of deep water, possible flood conditions that exist during storm periods
and other dangers that exist.
               h.   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be

               l.   Anti-seep collars shall be installed on all pipe outlets
which pass through the basin embankment.
               m.   Since these Standards require that the outflow rate from
control basin is held to a 1 year, 24-hour predevelopment rate and the control
basin must also be designed to detain the expected runoff from a 100 year, 24
hour post development condition, a two stage orifice control may be required on
most basins.
            4.   Parking Lot Detention.
               a.   Parking Lot Detention is primarily applicable to single lot
commercial, industrial and multi-family developments. This type of storm water
control means for subdivision development must be approved by the Village for
proper application.
               b.   See Section
1178.05(c)(2) for details and requirements regarding this type of storm water
control measure.
            5.   Other Alternative Methods. Other methods of providing storm
water quantity control inherently also provide water quality control. Should
these methods be selected for consideration, coordination shall be made with
the Village regarding the applicability to the proposed site. Generally, design
Standards for these methods shall conform to the ODOT, L&D - Volume II and the
ODNR Manual for Rainwater and Land Development, Second Edition.
   (c)   Commercial Site Storm System Design.
      (1)   General.
         A.   The system shall be designed to convey the flows from the
tributary area within the proposed development and existing flows from offsite
areas that are upstream from the development which may be interrupted by the
proposed development.
         B.   The parking lots shall be drained by means of catch basins and
storm sewers to an adequate outlet or quantity control structure.
         C.   The parking lot shall be graded such that the surface water runs
off to the catch basin or basins in a low area to permit detention of the
runoff and the use of parking lot storage where applicable.
         D.   All roof top areas and/or building storm water drainage systems
shall drain to the parking lot system for controlling storm water rate of
runoff prior to its release to downstream properties.
         E.   The catch basins must pick up the water on the paved surface.
Sheet flow will not be permitted into the public right-of-way for collection by
street storm water conveyance systems.
         F.   The desired maximum distance for overland flow should be
approximately 250 to 300 feet before entering a storm structure.
         G.   The desired maximum overland drainage area tributary to the storm
structure should be no greater than 1.5 acres as permitted by storm sewer
system hydraulics.
      (2)   Design Criteria.
         A.   Storm Sewers. Private storm sewers; such as in single lot multi-
family residential, commercial, or industrial development, shall be designed
and constructed with the capacity to adequately handle the 2-year, 24 hour
storm event at full capacity and nonsurcharging. A 5-year, 24 hour storm event
shall be used to develop the hydraulic gradient which shall not exceed the
window or grate elevation of the storm structure or exceed the gutter/curb line
of the roadway or parking area.
         B.   Open Channels. Ditches shall be designed and constructed with the
capacity to adequately handle the discharge expected from a 10-year, 24 hour
storm event. Shear stress protection shall be constructed with respect to the
velocity from a 2-year frequency (post development).
         C.   Quantity Control. If the site (or a portion of the site) post-
development runoff volume is calculated to be greater than the predevelopment
runoff volume from the same area; the runoff volume, and thereby flow rate,
shall be offset by employing the Critical Storm Method as described previously.
The detention or ponding area shall be designed as per Section
1178.05 of the Standards.
            1.   Types. Multiple options are provided for achieving the
required storm water quantity control. Refer to Section
1178.05(b)(6), for a complete description and design details associated with
Detention or Retention Basins. See also this same section for the other
alternate methods as listed and their respective design reference documents.
               Acceptable Commercial
               a.   Detention Basin

               d.   Underground Storage
               Alternative Methods - Infiltration Trench
               a.   Infiltration Basin
               b.   Extended Detention Basin
The selection of the storm water control facility type shall be dependent upon
the existing site conditions present. Each site varies in its design
constraints and, as with other site design elements, the storm water control
facility shall be selected and designed accordingly.
         D.   Detention and Retention Basins. See Section
1178.05(b)(6) for design Criteria.
         E.   Parking Lot Detention.
            1.   Surface storage is achieved through shallow ponding designed
to flood specific graded areas of the parking lot.
            2.   Controlled release features are incorporated into the surface
drainage system of the parking lot via proper design discharge pipe size and
slope in the receiving inlet and increased curb heights. Other control features
not listed may be employed as approved by the Village.
            3.   Special attention must be paid to the geometric design,
surface slope, and inlet elevation of the parking lot for Parking Lot Detention
to be properly employed.
            4.   Ponding areas in parking or traffic areas shall be designed
for a maximum potential depth of 8-inches with flood/overflow routing to an
appropriate receiving storm water conveyance system after the maximum storage
depth is reached.
            5.   This method is intended to control the runoff directly from
the parking area, and therefore, typically not large enough to serve as a
primary detention system or for storing large runoff volumes.
            6.   Clogging of the flow control device and icy conditions during
cold weather must be maintained for proper operation of this system.
         F.   Underground Detention/Retention.
            1.   Underground retention/detention achieves the capture and
temporary storage of storm water collected from the tributary drainage area.
Curb inlets or surface drains lead storm water to underground vaults or systems
of large diameter interconnected storage pipes. The storm water is then
released directly through an outlet pipe back into a storm water drainage
system. The outlet system is designed to meet the quantity control
requirements.
            2.   Underground retention/detention may be useful for developments
where land availability and land costs predicate against the development of
surface storm water control measures and in retrofit and redevelopment
settings.
            3.   Pretreatment is strongly recommended for minimizing
maintenance of the storage unit and should be designed to remove sediment,
floatables, and oils if prevalent in the drainage area.
            4.   Where an opening is provided that could allow the entry of
personnel, the opening shall be marked, “DANGER CONFINED SPACE”.
               (Ord. 65-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
1178.06 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   Erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy the
performance criteria shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of ODNR, Manual for Rainwater & Land Development, Ohio EPA, and Pike
County Soil and Water Conservation District.
      (2)   The performance criteria are general guidelines and shall not limit
the right of the Village to impose additional, more stringent requirements, nor
shall the criteria limit the right of the Village to waive individual
requirements.
   (b)   Design Criteria.
      (1)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices - Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout earth disturbing activity. Settling facilities,
sediment barriers, and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be
implemented as the first step of grading and within seven (7) days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the upslope
development area is stabilized.
      (2)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas - Denuded areas shall have soil
stabilization applied within seven (7) days if they are to remain dormant
(undisturbed) for more than forty-five (45) days. Permanent or temporary soil
stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within seven (7) days after
final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and shall also be applied
within seven (7) days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade, but
will remain dormant for longer than forty-five (45) days.
      (3)   Settling Facilities - Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded
areas flowing at rates which exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers,
shall pass through a sediment-settling facility. The facility’s storage
capacity shall be sixty-seven (67) cubic yards per acre of drainage area.
      (4)   Sediment Barriers - Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by sediment barriers. Sediment barriers, such as sediment fences or
diversions directing runoff to settling facilities, shall protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment transported by sheet flow.
      (5)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection - All storm sewer inlets which accept
water runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment-
laden water will not enter the storm sewer system without first being treated
to remove sediment, unless the storm sewer system drains to a settling
facility.
      (6)   Working in or Crossing Streams. Streams, including beds and banks,
shall be stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed,
interrupted, or stopped. To the extent practicable, construction vehicles shall
be kept out of streams. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall
be taken to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion.
If a live (wet) stream must be crossed by construction vehicles regularly
during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
      (7)   Construction Access Routes. - Measures shall be taken to prevent
soil transport onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls,
or onto public roads.
      (8)   Sloughing and Dumping. No soil, rock, debris, or any other material
shall be dumped or placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it
may readily slough, slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or
placing is authorized by the Village of Waverly, and, when applicable, the
USACE or ODNR, for such purposes as, but not limited to, construction of
bridges, culverts, and erosion control structures. Unstable soils prone to
slipping or landslides shall not be graded, excavated, filled nor have loads
imposed upon them unless the work is done in accordance with a qualified
professional engineer’s recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately
address such problems.
      (9)   Cut and Fill Slopes - Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be
given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up-slope drainage
area, groundwater conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (10)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels - Outfalls and constructed
or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the
expected velocity of flow from a postdevelopment, 10-year, 24 hour storm
without eroding.
      (11)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation - Permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Village provides adequate cover and is
mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive adverse
weather conditions.
      (12)   Disposition of Temporary Practices - All temporary erosion and
sediment control practices shall be removed or permanently stabilized within
thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the
Village.
   (c)   Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control
practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance
requirements. They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure
continued performance of their intended function. The person or entity
responsible for the continued maintenance of permanent erosion controls shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the Village.

dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling containing at least five residential
dwelling units but not more than nineteen residential dwelling units;
   (e)    Fifty dollars ($50.00) for each residential dwelling unit in a
multiple dwelling containing twenty or more residential dwelling units; and
   (f)   Eighty-two dollars and fifty cents ($82.50) for each mobile home lot
in a mobile home park. (Ord. 77-9. Passed 5-16-77.)
1191.05 LAND-IN-LIEU OF FEES.
   In all new subdivisions and special use residential developments, land-in-
lieu of provisions may be acceptable and are to be considered by the Planning
Commission. A majority of Council shall approve the park and recreational
provision to be included in the new development. A minimum of five percent (5%)
of the development excluding streets and easements, shall be platted and
dedicated to the City for the specific use of parks. In small developments when
land-in-lieu provisions are not practical, no less than the minimum stated in
Section
1191.04 shall be assessed each developer.

1343.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Waverly, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Waverly has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
               (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and
other development which may increase flood damage; and,
               (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood
barriers, which will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase
flood hazards in other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Waverly, as identified in Section
1343.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Waverly.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Pike County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Pike County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective November 4, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
including:
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Waverly as required by Section
1343.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Waverly Mayors Office, 201 W. North Street,
Waverly, Ohio, Pike County.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Waverly, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 64-2010. Passed 11-16-10.)

      D.   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
      E.   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system
under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Waverly's historic preservation program, which is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Waverly Flood
Insurance Rate Map, January 15, 1988, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (27)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 64-2010. Passed 11-16-10.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Waverly's flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1343.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1343.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1343.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1343.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Waverly, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Waverly have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Waverly's Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Waverly
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Waverly suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Waverly has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1343.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of Section
1343.04(d).
   (e)   Nonresidential Structures.
             (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet the
requirements of subsection (d)(1) - (3) and (5) -(7).
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,

      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of subsection (d)(5)C.;
   (g)   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles must meet at least one of
the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days, or

resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1343.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Waverly and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. hereof, items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the “USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique”
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Waverly specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1343.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 64-2010. Passed 11-16-10.)
1343.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Waverly Planning Commission is hereby appointed to
serve as the appeals board for these regulations as established by the City of
Waverly.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City of
Waverly's Mayor's Office, 201 W. North Street, Waverly, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Waverly, established in Section
1111.05.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. 1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Pike County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Waverly, Ohio, or State of Ohio.
(Ord. 116-2024. Passed 12-18-24.)
1355.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This Chapter shall be applicable to all residential, commercial, and
industrial structures located within the Village of Waverly, Ohio.
(Ord. 116-2024. Passed 12-18-24.)
1355.03 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this section:
   (a)   "Abandoned" means a structure that is unoccupied as the result of the
relinquishment of possession or control by an owner or other person with the
right of possession or control of the structure, a mortgagor or the mortgagor's
assigns whether or not the mortgagor or mortgagor's assigns have relinquished
equity and title. A structure may be deemed abandoned when there is evidence of
conditions, taken separately or as a whole, that would lead a reasonable person
to conclude that the property was abandoned, including, but not limited to,
evidence of overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of newspapers,
circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means of notice by
publication, the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris, absence of
windows or window treatments, absence of furnishings and personal items,
statements of neighbors, delivery agents or similarly situated persons that the
property is abandoned.
   (b)   "Housing Officer" means the Housing Officer of the Village of Waverly,

to order corrective measures and/or initiate administrative, civil, or criminal
proceedings.
   (e)   "Vacant" means a structure that is not lawfully occupied or that
otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-family residential
structures shall be considered vacant when substantially all of the dwelling
units are not lawfully occupied or that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned"
under this Section. Commercial structures shall be considered vacant when all
commercial activity has ceased at the site or that otherwise qualifies as
"Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-tenant commercial structures shall be
considered vacant when substantially all of the units are not lawfully occupied
or engaging in commercial activity, or that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned"
under this Section. Industrial structures shall be considered abandoned when
all industrial or manufacturing activity has ceased at the site or that
otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-tenant industrial
structures shall be considered vacant when substantially all of the units are
not lawfully occupied or engaging in industrial or manufacturing activity, or
that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. In determining
whether a structure is vacant, it is also relevant to consider, among other
factors, the percentage of the overall square footage of the building or floor
not in use to the occupied space; the condition and value of any items in the
structure and the presence of rental or for sale signs on the property.
A property that is temporarily unoccupied and is in the process of being
renovated under necessary and unexpired permits shall not be considered vacant.
The owner must register the renovations with Village of Waverly, Ohio, Housing
Officer. The renovations must be completed within six (6) months if no
applicable building permits are needed.
            A property that is listed for sale with a licensed realtor under a
fully executed listing agreement shall not be considered vacant for the first
six (6) months of the listing agreement under which the property was first
listed for sale. Such property shall be considered vacant for purposes of this
Section upon the expiration of the first six (6) month period for which it is
first listed for sale or upon a subsequent re-listing with the same or a
different licensed realtor. Unoccupied property listed as "For Sale by Owner"
shall be considered vacant for purposes of this Section.
   (f)   "Owner" means the registered owner of a property, any person who holds
legal or equitable title to the property, is a mortgagee, a vendee-in-
possession, assignee of rents, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other
person, firm or corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a
property. The Owner of a property in default or for which a foreclosure action
is pending or for which a judgment in foreclosure has been issued shall include
the mortgagee, the successor in interest to the mortgagee, the lender or
servicing company and any agent acting for the mortgagee, its successors, or a
lender or servicing company. Under this definition, there may be more than one
"Owner" of a property for purposes of this Chapter.
   (g)   "Secure" means a covering shall be placed over all doors and windows
which are within fifteen (15) feet of the exterior grade, consisting of one-
half (½) inch thick plywood attached to the framing of all such doors and
windows by wood screws of a minimum length of one and one-half (1 ½) inches,
placed twelve inches on center. Such plywood shall be painted with a minimum of
two (2) coats of oil-based exterior paint. In order to be considered secure, a
property must also be in compliance with all requirements of the Village of
Waverly Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 116-2024. Passed 12-18-24.)
1355.04 OWNER REQUIRED TO ACT; ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The owner of any structure that has become vacant as defined above
shall, within thirty (30) days after the structure first becomes vacant, within
thirty (30) days of receiving notice that a structure is vacant, or within
thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Chapter, whichever is later,
file a registration statement for each such structure with the Housing Officer
or his or her designee on forms provided for such purposes. Any Owner of a
property which files a foreclosure action against said property, or for which a
foreclosure action is pending, or a judgment of foreclosure has been issued
shall, in addition to all other requirements of this Section, provide a cash
bond acceptable to the Housing Officer or his designee, in the sum of not less
than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), to secure the continued maintenance of
the property throughout its vacancy and remunerate the Village of Waverly, Ohio
for any expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing, marking and/or
making such building safe by any legal means including, but not limited to,
demolition. A portion of said bond in an amount to be determined by the Housing
Officer shall be retained by the Village of Waverly as an administrative fee to
fund an account for expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing and/or
marking said building and other buildings which are involved in the foreclosure
process or vacant.
   The registration statement shall remain valid for one year from the date of
registration. The registering party shall be required to annually renew the
registration as long as the structure remains vacant and shall pay an annual
registration fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each residential
structure and one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for each commercial
or industrial structure; provided, however; that all religious, educational,
benevolent or charitable associations, all governmental agencies shall be
exempt from the payment of the annual registration fee. Each consecutive year
the structure remains vacant the registration fee doubles.
   The registering party shall not be entitled to a refund of all or any part
of the registration fee should the structure no longer be deemed vacant during
the annual registration period.
      The owner shall notify the Housing Officer or his or her designee within
twenty (20) days of any change in the registration information by filing an
amended statement on a form provided for such purposes. The registration
