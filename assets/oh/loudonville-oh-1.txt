time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Justinian

   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;

general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Loudonville, Ohio,
1973.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct

enacted prior to September 3, 1973, which are inconsistent with any provision
of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of
this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the 1973 Codified Ordinances of
Loudonville was either ordinances or resolutions previously enacted by Council,
or new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the 1973 Codified
Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new matter
ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of
all source material in the 1973 Loudonville Codified Ordinances is indicated.

done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last

after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)

202.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
202.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
202.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
    EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references

220.01 RULES OF COUNCIL.
   Rule 1. President. The Mayor shall be the President of Council and shall
preside at all regular and special meetings thereof, but shall have no vote
except in case of a tie.
(ORC 733.24)
   Rule 2. President Pro Tempore. At the first regular meeting in January of
each year, Council shall immediately elect a President pro tempore from its own
number, who shall serve until the first meeting in January of the following
year. When the Mayor is absent from the Village or is unable for any reason to
perform his or her duties, the President pro tempore shall be the Acting Mayor
and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the Mayor. (ORC
731.10)
   In the absence of both the President and the President pro tempore, Council
shall appoint a temporary Chairperson.
   Rule 3. Succession. In case of the death, resignation or removal of the
Mayor, the President pro tempore shall become the Mayor and serve for the
unexpired term. When the President pro tempore becomes the Mayor, the vacancy
created shall be filled by election of another President pro tempore. (ORC
731.11, 731.43, 733.25)
   Rule 4. Vacancies. When the office of a member of Council becomes vacant,
the vacancy shall be filled by election by Council for the unexpired term. If
Council fails, within thirty days, to fill such vacancy, the Mayor shall fill
it by appointment.
(ORC 731.43)
   Rule 5. Resignation. The resignation of a member of Council shall not take
effect until the same has been accepted by a vote of a majority of the members,
exclusive of the person tendering the resignation.
   Rule 6. Administrative Responsibility. Under the general laws of Ohio
applicable to noncharter Villages, both legislative and administrative
authority is vested in Council. This apparent overlapping of authority warrants
clarification as it applies to the Mayor as the executive head and to the
conduct of administrative work. For example, Council is made responsible for
general policies, plan approvals, financial control and organization strength,
whereas the Mayor is responsible for execution of policy, plan accomplishment,
financial integrity and personal management. When Council considers and
approves or disapproves the payment of bills, appointments to positions, zoning
standards of a planning commission, budget requests and other forms of
administration by the Mayor, the staff, commissions and committees, it is
acting in an administrative capacity in conformity with constituted village
government and with specific laws. This relationship is basic to noncharter
Villages and is not to be confused with the powers and distinctions of a
charter or city government.
   Council uses standing and special committees to assist in expediting its
work. (See Rules 7 and 8.) These committees are concerned with both legislative
and administrative matters. It must be borne in mind by these committees, by
individuals and by the Mayor that any decision involving the exercise of
judgment or discretion must be made by Council as a body. For everyone
concerned to foster this relationship is to observe the spirit of the law.
   Rule 7. Standing Committees; Special Committees. At no later than the first
regular meeting of Council after its organization, the President of Council
shall appoint standing committees, each consisting of three members (the first
named member to be Chairperson) for the following programs:
 
a.   Finance/Audit    d.   Planning and Zoning
b.   Safety           e.   Streets
c.   Parks and Buildinf.   Utilities
   Temporary special committees may be appointed by the President, with the
approval of Council, to undertake some special task. The President may at any
time remove any member of any committee appointed by him or her and appoint a
new member to serve in place of the one removed.
(Ord. 66-2003. Passed 1-5-04.)
   Rule 8. Committee Responsibilities.
    a.    A standing committee shall:
      1.    Follow Council direction in matters referred to it;
       2.    Normally be expected to investigate or study a given problem or
need, taking no decisive action itself but submitting a report and
recommendations;
      3.    Within its area of responsibility, assume both short and long range
study of plans and needs, work to establish desirable economic, budgetary and
work standards, train others and inspect for accomplishment; and
      4.    Assume no direction and issue no order in conflict with the
executive officers of the Village, or the law, thereby acting in an advisory
capacity, reporting to Council for action.
    b.    A special committee shall be given direction by Council when
appointed and shall be discharged upon receipt of its report.
(Res. 35-84. Passed 8-6-84.)
   Rule 9. Meetings; Mayor's Reports. Regular meetings shall be held in the
Council Chambers of the Town Hall at 7:00 p.m., official time, on the first and
third Mondays of each month. A change in meeting time or place is subject to
Council action.
   When any regular meeting of Council falls on a legal holiday, Council shall
meet in regular session on the day following at the stated place and hour.
Special meetings may be called by the President or any three members of
Council, provided that at least twenty-four hours notice is given to each
member, served personally or left at his or her usual place of residence. Any
member may waive, in writing, notice of any special meeting.
   At the first regular meeting in January of each year, and at such other
times as the Mayor deems expedient, he or she shall report to Council
concerning the affairs of the Village and recommend such measures as seem
proper to him or her.
(ORC 733.41; Ord. 89-91. Passed 11-18-91; Ord. 25-94. Passed 5-2-94.)
   Rule 10. Attendance: Public Meetings. Attendance at Council meetings shall
ordinarily include the Clerk-Treasurer, the Mayor, the Law Director and such
other staff and department heads as may be requested. Meetings of Council shall
be open to the public.
(ORC 731.46)
   Rule 11. Record of Proceedings: Special Agenda. The Clerk-Treasurer shall
keep a record of the proceedings and of all rules, bylaws, resolutions and
ordinances passed or adopted, which record shall be subject to inspection by
all persons interested. In case of the absence of the Clerk- Treasurer and of
his or her deputies, Council shall appoint one of its members to perform his or
her duties as Clerk of Council.
   The Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare an agenda for every meeting, attend to all
correspondence incidental to his or her office and perform such other duties as
may be assigned by a majority vote of Council or as required by law.
   The Clerk-Treasurer shall be notified by officers and committee Chairpersons
of matters to be presented, including ordinances and resolutions, in order that
they may be listed on the meeting agenda. Such notification shall be made not
later than 12:00 noon on the Thursday preceding a regularly scheduled Council
meeting or as soon as possible before a special Council meeting.
   Rule 12. Order of Business; Visitors' Register.
   a.    The business of regular Council meetings shall be transacted in the
following order:
      1.    Roll call. To determine if a quorum is present;
      2.    Minutes. Reading, approval and disposal of the journal;
      3.    Visitors. Introduction of persons or delegations;
      4.    Legislation. Reading of ordinances and resolutions;
      5.    Reports of officers and committees;
      6.    Old business;

      8.    Bills. Reading and approval.
   b.    The Presiding Officer of Council may at any time permit a member to
introduce an ordinance, motion or resolution out of the regular order for the
same, unless such exception is objected to by a majority of the members
present.
   c.    When visitors are present, the Clerk-Treasurer shall circulate a
register sheet to show the name and address of each visitor and reference to
the subject matter to be presented by each visitor, if any. Such register shall
be deposited with the Presiding Officer early in the order of business.
   Rule 13. Procedure for hearing visitors. Council customarily accommodates
visitors by providing time to hear their concerns or requests, while under the
main obligation of conducting its scheduled business within normal limits of
time. Where an elector, taxpayer or other person desires to be heard by
Council, he or she shall notify the Clerk-Treasurer in order that his or her
business may be listed on the meeting agenda. Such notification shall be made
not later than 12:00 noon on the Thursday preceding a regularly scheduled
Council meeting or as soon as possible before a special Council meeting. Any
elector, taxpayer or other person who desires to be heard and whose business
does not appear on the agenda, shall be heard only after all of the electors,
taxpayers or other persons whose business appears on the agenda have been
heard. The Presiding Officer, at his or her sole discretion, may limit the time
in which an elector, taxpayer, or other person not appearing on the agenda may
be heard.
   Rule 14. Opening Procedure; Quorum. The President of Council shall take the
Chair at the time appointed for Council to meet and immediately call the
members to order. He or she shall then determine if a quorum is present, cause
the journal of the preceding session to be disposed of and continue on with the
prescribed order of business.
   A majority of all members elected shall be a quorum, but fewer may adjourn
from day to day and compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and
under such penalties as are prescribed by law.
(ORC 731.44)
   Rule 15. Order and Decorum. The President of Council shall preserve order
and decorum and confine members in debate to the question. He or she may, in
common with any other member, call any member to order who violates any of the
rules and shall, when in the Chair, decide all questions of order, subject to
an appeal to Council on the demand of two members. On such appeal, there shall
be no debate, but the member making the appeal may briefly state his or her
reasons for the same and the Presiding Officer shall have the same right to a
similar statement.
   The Presiding Officer shall see that the business properly brought before
Council is conducted in an orderly manner and that the members of Council
observe the rules of procedure.
   Rule 16. Punishment or Expulsion of Members for Violations; Delinquency.
Council may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct or for a
violation of its rules and declare his or her seat vacant for absence without
valid excuse where such absence has continued for two months. No expulsion
shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the members
elected and until the delinquent member has been notified of the charge against
him or her and has had an opportunity to be heard.
(ORC 731.45)
   Rule 17. Voting. Every member present shall vote by a yea, nay or
abstention.
   
   Rule 18. Reference to Committee. Any new business brought before Council
shall be referred to the proper committee, if such referral is deemed necessary
or proper. If such referral is not needed and the matter can be disposed of
quickly, then such action should be taken at once. When communications are
read, they may, if necessary, be referred to a committee immediately after
being read by the Clerk-Treasurer. Prolonged argument, discussion and debate
shall be avoided. If the matter under consideration requires investigation and
study or is of such a nature that long discussion may be provoked, it shall be
referred to a committee promptly by the Presiding officer.
   If any matter referred by Council to any committee or officer is not
reported upon by
the next regularly scheduled meeting, such matter shall be brought by the
Clerk-Treasurer to the attention of Council, which shall take such further
action in the premises as it deems best.
   Council may accept or reject any committee report in whole or part.
   Rule 19. Reference to Council as a Committee of the Whole. There are times
when a matter will be referred to Council as a Committee of the Whole. This is
a meeting of the entire Council as a committee, but instead of the usual
Presiding officer being in charge, a Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole
shall preside. The designated Chairperson shall inform the public in advance of
the time and place of the meeting of the Committee of the Whole. Referral to
this Committee may take place when a major situation or problem arises on which
it is felt that every member of Council should have an opportunity to express
himself or herself; when debate or discussion in the regular meeting would
consume too much time and interfere with the regular order of business; and
when referral to some committee will restrict consideration and study of the
problem or question to only the committee members. The Committee of the Whole
shall sit as a committee and discuss the question as a group and receive the
views and opinions of all members. The Committee of the Whole shall be governed
by the rules of Council in its deliberations. The Committee shall report its
recommendations or findings to Council. If the Committee believes that further
study or investigation is indicated, it may recommend to Council that the
matter be referred to a certain committee. Any report of the Committee of the
Whole shall be presented to Council, just as in the case of any other committee
report.
   Rule 20. Preparation of Legislation. When Council desires the preparation of
ordinances and/or resolutions, it shall, by a majority vote, request their
preparation by the Law Director.
   Rule 21. Voting on Legislation; Seconding of Motions.
    a.    Ordinances and resolutions shall always be voted upon separately,
even though the committee report urging approval of such legislation may be
adopted unanimously. The voting on such legislation shall be entered by the
Clerk-Treasurer in writing in the minutes as "aye" and "nay," together with the
names of the members of Council voting "aye," those voting “nay” and those
abstaining from voting.
   b.    Each motion shall be seconded before further action thereon.
   Rule 22. Majority, Two-Thirds and Three-Fourths Defined; Majority Required
for Passage of Ordinances. Whenever the term "majority" is used in these Rules,
it shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, be held to mean a majority of
those elected to Council. Likewise, whenever a two-thirds or three-fourths vote
is indicated, it shall mean two-thirds or three-fourths of the members elected
to Council. Thus, in a Council of six members, a majority shall be four, and
three-fourths shall be five. No ordinance shall be passed by Council without
the concurrence of a majority of the members.
   Rule 23. Three Readings Requirement. No ordinance or resolution granting a
franchise or creating a right, or involving the expenditure of money or the
levying of any tax, or for the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of property,
shall be passed, unless the same is read on three different days. There shall
be no authority to dispense with this rule, except by a three-fourths vote of
the members.
   Rule 24. Second Reading of Ordinances; Emergency Ordinances. When an
ordinance is presented, it shall be read by the Law Director. If it is not an
emergency ordinance, it should be set aside for a second reading at the next
meeting of Council. If it is an emergency ordinance requiring immediate action,
the Presiding officer shall, after it is read by the Law Director, entertain a
motion to suspend the rules. If three-fourths of the members of Council approve
such motion, the second and third reading of the ordinance shall not be
necessary and such ordinance may be presented for passage.
   After a member moves for passage, a vote shall be taken. If a two-thirds
majority approves the passage of the ordinance, it shall be signed by the
Clerk-Treasurer and the Mayor. Legislation passed as an emergency measure must
have the reason stated for the emergency in some detail, not in the mere
general terms that such action is "necessary for the peace, health, welfare and
safety of the Village."
   Rule 25. Amending Resolutions and Ordinances. It shall be in order to amend
a resolution or ordinance at any time, but if such ordinance or resolution is
of a general or permanent nature and such amendment is made after the second
reading, it shall again be read as amended as the second reading and laid over
to the next meeting for final action.
   Rule 26. Limitations on Debate. No member of Council, while Council is in
session, shall engage in debate or discussion with anyone save another member
of Council, the President of Council or some person who has either been granted
by Council the privilege to address Council or is present at a Council meeting
by invitation of Council. All such debate or discussion shall be governed by
Robert's Rules of Order.
   No member shall speak more than once upon any subject, until every member
choosing to speak has had an opportunity to be heard.
   Rule 27. Adjourned Meetings. When the business of Council is not completed
within the available time at a given meeting, the meeting, by motion, may be
adjourned to a definite time. When Council reconvenes at the appointed time, it
shall take up the business where it left off at its former meeting, provided a
quorum is present. A reconvened meeting is merely a continuation of the meeting
that was adjourned.
   Rule 28. Motions; When Debatable; Withdrawal. When a motion is made and
seconded, it shall be stated by the Presiding officer before any debate is in
order. Any such motion, and any amendment thereto, may be withdrawn by the
movers thereof at any time before decision.
   Rule 29. Division of Question. Any member may call for a division of the
question or the Presiding Officer may direct the same. In either case, the same
shall be divided if it comprehends questions so distinct that if one is taken
away the other will stand as an entire question for decision.
   Rule 30. Precedence of Motions to Refer. When there is a question of
referring a given subject to a standing committee or to a special committee,
the question of reference to a standing committee shall be put first.
   Rule 31. Motions to Adjourn, to Lay on The Table and for the Previous
Question.
    The Motion to adjourn (which requires no second) shall always be in order,
unless Council is engaged in voting. Motions to adjourn, to lay on the table or
for the previous question shall be decided without debate.
   Rule 32. Acceptable Motions; Order of Precedence. When a question or
proposition is before Council or under debate, no motion shall be received,
except the following:
   a.    To adjourn;
   b.    To lay on the table;
   c.    For the previous question (request that discussion end and a vote be
taken);
   d.    To postpone to a certain day;
   e.    To commit (to refer to a standing or special committee);
   f.    To amend; and
   g.    To postpone indefinitely.
   Such motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are herein
listed.
   Rule 33. Robert's Rules of Order. In the absence of any rule upon a matter
of business, Council shall be governed by the current edition of Robert's Rules
of Order.
   Rule 34. Amendments. These Rules may be amended or altered or new rules may
be adopted by a vote of a majority of all the members elected at any meeting of
Council, on the report of a committee to which the subject has been referred at
a previous meeting.

permits said employee(s) to do so, then said decision shall constitute “Village
purposes” and “Village business” pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Personnel
Policy Manual. Said use and possession are therefore permitted under said
section.
   (b)   Nothing in this section should be interpreted as permitting use of a
Village vehicle for non-Village purposes or in violation of any portion of the
Personnel Policy Manual. This section is only for the purpose of permitting
certain Village employees to keep Village vehicles at their residences for
potential off-hour work needs.

or of intimidating, coercing or unlawfully influencing others from remaining in
or from assuming such public employment. The provisions of this chapter do not
limit, impair or affect the right of any employee, as defined above, to the
expression or communication of a view, grievance, complaint or opinion on any
matter related to the conditions or compensation of public employment or their
betterment, so long as such expression or communication is not designed to
interfere with, and does not interfere with, the full, faithful and proper
performance of the duties of employment.
      (Ord. 30-80. Passed 8-4-80.)
251.02 LIMITATION ON SUPERVISORS.
   No person exercising any authority, supervision or direction over any

to such a strike.
(Ord. 30-80. Passed 8-4-80.)
251.03 NOTICE TO STRIKERS; HEARINGS.
   Any employee who, without the approval of his superior, unlawfully fails to

compensation, rights, privileges or obligations of employment or of
intimidating, coercing or unlawfully influencing others from remaining in or
from assuming such public employment, is on strike, provided that notice that
he is on strike and forthwith suspended without pay is sent to such employee by
the Village Clerk or such employee's direct superior by mail addressed to his
residence as set forth in his employment record. Such employee, upon request,
shall be entitled to establish that he did not violate this chapter. Such
request must be filed in writing, with the Mayor, within ten calendar days
after the regular compensation of such employee has ceased. In the case of such
a request, the Mayor shall, within ten days of the receipt of such request,

and regulations appropriate to a proceeding to remove such employee. Such
proceedings shall be undertaken without unnecessary delay.

shall serve without tenure and at the pleasure of the appointing or employing
officer or body.

251.06 RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS.
   No employee organization shall engage in, cause, instigate, encourage or
condone a strike against the Village. In determining whether an employee
organization has engaged in a strike against the Village in violation of this
chapter, the following shall be considered:
   (a)    Whether the employee organization called the strike or made a good
faith effort to prevent it; and
   (b)    Whether the employee organization made or was making good faith

258.01 BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the Municipality, its employees and customers from data loss and
identity theft is of significant concern to the municipality and can be reduced
only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor. (Res. 33-
2009. Passed 5-4-09.)
258.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The Municipality adopts this sensitive information policy to help
protect employees, customers, contractors and the municipality from damages
related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information.
   (b)   This policy will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the Municipality in compliance with State and Federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (c)   This policy enables the Municipality to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the
Municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
Municipality.
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
         (Res. 33-2009. Passed 5-4-09.)
258.03 SCOPE.
   This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the Municipality,
including all personnel affiliated with third parties.
(Res. 33-2009. Passed 5-4-09.)
258.04 POLICY.
   (a)   Sensitive Information Policy.
      (1)   Definition of sensitive information. Sensitive information includes
the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format:
         A.   Credit card information, including any of the following:
            1.   Credit card number (in part or whole)
            2.   Credit card expiration date

            2.   Insurance claims
            3.   Prescriptions
            4.   Any related personal medical information
         F.   Other personal information belonging to any customer, employee or
contractor, examples of which include:
            1.   Date of birth
            2.   Address
            3.   Phone numbers
            4.   Maiden name
            5.   Names
            6.   Customer number
         G.   Municipal personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment
in securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this
section should be read in conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act and the
municipality’s open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the
sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he/she should contact their
supervisor.
      (2)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee performing work for the
municipality and each contractor performing services for the Village and
handling information for the municipality that is the subject of this policy
will comply with the following policies:
         A.   File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
         B.   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
         C.   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
         D.   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use.
         E.   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded
they will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical shredding device. Shred bins are labeled “Confidential paper
shredding and recycling.” Municipal records, however, may only be destroyed in
accordance with the Village’s records retention policy.
      (3)   Electronic Distribution. Each employee and contractor performing
work for the municipality that deals with the records that are the subject of
this policy will comply with the following policies:
         A.   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using
approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when
sent in an electronic format.
         B.   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
      “This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and
is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use
by others is strictly prohibited.”
         (Res. 33-2009. Passed 5-4-09.)
258.05 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags.  
      (1)   The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time
a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it
should be investigated for verification.
         A.   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer report agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in §334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act.
      (2)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (c)   Suspicious Documents.
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information.
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For
example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File; or
         C.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Municipality. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      (4)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      (5)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (6)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (7)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the municipality.
      (8)   When using security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)   Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered
Account.
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
         A.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
         B.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer’s covered account.
      (6)   The municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
      (7)   The municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer’s covered account.
      (8)   The municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
municipality.
      (9)   The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
         (Res. 33-2009. Passed 5-4-09.)
258.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the employee’s/contractor’s supervisor for determination.
      (2)   The supervisor will complete additional authentication to determine
whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (b)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the municipality; and

TITLE EIGHT - Judicial
Chap.
270. Mayor’s Court
CHAPTER 270
Mayor’s Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

408.02 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   "Distracted" means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   "Distracted" does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
432.43.
      (3)   "Distracted" does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
         As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   "Utility" means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   "Utility service vehicle" means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

414.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.

in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy- two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
            The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the
offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and
requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
             The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-
day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a community
control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days,
requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’
intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term
equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not
spend attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition
of community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
            If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
               If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term
imposed by the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting
unlimited driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of
monitoring and jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed
by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider.
               The purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the

warranted. Upon the request of the court, the services provider shall submit
the results of the assessment to the court, including all treatment
recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

failure to erect signs of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 in a
particular construction zone in accordance with those guidelines and design

436.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
       REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (e)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

440.10 WEIGHING VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale especially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load- receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to
the nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing,
provided such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is
stopped. Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of
a vehicle and its load shall be annually compared by the Municipal, County or
State sealer with the State standards or standards approved by the State, and
such scales shall not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards
or standards approved by the State.
   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations. During
determinations of weight by compact, self-contained, portable scales, they
shall be used on level terrain of sufficient length and width to accommodate
the entire vehicle being weighed.
   Whenever such officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, and this chapter, or, when compact,

606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
606.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
606.08 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a

      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any

deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this subsection (c), “advanced practice registered
nurse” does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a

patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege

for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under subsection (f)(1) of this section, and the information may
be admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5119.36.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

handicapped regulations or adopt plans for needed structural or program changes
to reach compliance. The complainant, the self-evaluation team and the
Coordinator shall be notified, in writing or by other appropriate formal
methods of notification.
   (i)   The decision of Council shall be final.
      (Ord. 45-84. Passed 10-15-84.)
606.21 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)

commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)    Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)    Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)    Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)    Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)    It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)    No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.21.
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were
the principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section or in terms of the principal offense.

institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State and that
is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North Central

providing scientific services to law enforcement agencies and signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substance which is the basis
of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings
as to the content, weight and identity of the substance and that it contains
any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima-facie evidence of the content, identity and weight or the

642.24 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
642.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04 or
642.05,
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.145 or
 642.19 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
 642.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
642.145 or
642.19 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.02 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02, 
642.04 or
 642.05, Section
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 642.145 or
642.19, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
642.145 or
 642.19, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.

pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of

transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face

transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
642.24(c)(3).

the person who is obligated to pay for the service rendered through the meter,
conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or control of the meter,
conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred, has caused the
tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   In a prosecution for a theft offense that involves the alleged reconnection
of a gas, electric, steam or water meter, conduit, or attachment of a utility
that has been disconnected by the utility, proof that a meter, conduit or
attachment disconnected by a utility has been reconnected without the consent
of the utility is prima-facie evidence that the person in possession or control

reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment with intent to commit a theft
offense.

698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for
misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and
method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider the risk that the
offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public
therefrom; the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history, character
and condition of the offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative
treatment; any statement made by the victim, if the offense is a misdemeanor
specified in Ohio R.C. 2930.01(A); and the ability and resources of the
offender and the nature of the burden that payment of a fine will impose on
him.
   (b)   The following do not control the court’s discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
      (1)   The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;

victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or
permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
   (c)   The criteria listed in Ohio R.C. 2929.12, favoring shorter terms of
imprisonment for felony, do not control the court’s discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (d)   The criteria listed in subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall not be
construed to limit the matters which may be considered in determining whether
to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
   (e)   The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
   (f)   The court shall not impose a fine or fines which, in the aggregate and
to the extent not suspended by the court, exceed the amount which the offender
is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed without
undue hardship to himself or his dependents, or will prevent him from making
restitution or reparation to the victim of his offense.
   (g)   At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing, the
court shall notify the victim of the offense of his right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2743.51 through

R.C. 1905.35, it shall be required to reimburse the Village for their expenses
incurred by reason of said confinement, including, but not limited to: the
expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing, and shelter in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 2929.22.3, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 and 2947.19.
   (b)   Reimbursement shall be determined by the Court, including Mayor’s
Court of the Village of Loudonville, at a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.15 after the person is released from imprisonment to determine how the
reimbursement and whether the offender has the ability to pay the reimbursement
and the amount the person is able to pay. The offender shall have an
opportunity to be heard and may be represented by counsel at the hearing, at
the offender’s option. A record shall be made of the hearing.
   (c)   Reimbursable expenses shall include but not be limited to, the
expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing, shelter, medical care and
personal hygiene products, including, but not limited to, toothpaste,

sentencing that is credited against the offender’s term of imprisonment and up
to two hours overtime cost for the sheriff or municipal corporation incurred
relating to the trial of the person.
   (d)   Before holding a hearing on reimbursement pursuant to subsection (c)
hereof, the Court shall investigate or cause to investigate the offender’s
ability to pay the reimbursement and possible reimbursement scheduled and
methods. The amount of reimbursement shall be determined at the hearing in
light of the sentence of imprisonment given and according to the offender’s

wages derived from the offender’s labor and employment during the course of
incarceration;

   (e)   At the conclusion of the hearing held pursuant to this section, the
Court shall determine the amount of the reimbursable expenses owed by the
offender who is the subject to the hearing in the amount that the offender is
able to pay. If the Court determines that the offender is able to pay any of
the reimbursable expenses, the Court shall issue a judgment against the
offender in the amount of the reimbursable expenses that the offender is able
to pay.
   (f)   Upon the authorization of the legislative authority of the Village of
Loudonville, the Village Solicitor, City Director of Law, or similar chief
legal officer of the municipal corporation may pursue an appropriate civil
action in the name of the municipal corporation, in the Court of Common Pleas
of the county in which the prison, station house or jail is located, to recover
from the convict, the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement in the
prison, station house or county jails as determined by the Court pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.19. Said action shall be brought within one year after the
person is released from incarceration. The amount recovered shall be paid into

840.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
     (a)    Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
     (b)    Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in findings
incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986) and Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and on
studies in other cities including New York, New York; Islip, New York; Los
Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin,
Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover
County, North Carolina; and the State of Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)    Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)    Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)    Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)    Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)    Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually
oriented films.
      (6)    The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)    Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)    A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)    The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex- related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)    Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented
businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will
facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal,
state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest
in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)    Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)    The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)    A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

     (f)    In the event that an applicant for a new sexually oriented business
license or a new sexually oriented business employee license seeks judicial
review of the denial of a new license, and such review does not result in a
final judicial decision within sixty (60) days of the date the appeal was
filed, the Village will issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)    Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license
to operate the sexually oriented business named in the license application
under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business license issued
pursuant to Section
840.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof; and
      (2)    Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business employee license
issued pursuant to Section
840.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in Subparagraph (g) of
this Section; and
      (3)    Will be subject to the same requirements as a normal sexually
oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee license issued

license or sexually oriented business employee license is issued to the
applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)    The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
     (h)    In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Mayor pursuant to Section
840.12(b) or (e) of this chapter. The Mayor shall grant an application for
renewal of a provisional license unless the Mayor determines that new grounds
exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
840.07 or Section
840.09 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
Village has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial
appeal of the previous license denial.

860.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:    
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)    Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)    Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.

behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agents, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
860.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
 860.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section

5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
860.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
860.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
860.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
      A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
860.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
860.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
 860.04 of this Chapter on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
860.04 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
860.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
860.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
860.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
860.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
860.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
 860.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

860.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
860.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
860.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 860.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
 860.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
860.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality, the resident shall not pay a total municipal
income tax on taxable income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate of
the two municipalities.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives
Municipal Taxable Income for work done or services performed or rendered
outside of the Municipality, if it appears that he has paid a municipal income
tax on the same income taxable under this Chapter to another municipality,
shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter of the amount
so paid by him or on his behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall
not exceed the tax assessed by this Chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.
   (C)   Except as provided in subsection (D) hereof, if tax or withholding is
paid to a municipal corporation on Municipal Taxable Income, and if a second
municipal corporation imposes a tax on that income or wages after the time
period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipal corporation, the second municipal corporation shall allow a
nonrefundable credit, against the tax or withholding the second municipality
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipal corporation with respect to such income
or wages.
   (D)   If the tax rate in the second municipal corporation is less than the
tax rate in the first municipal corporation, then the credit described in
subsection (C) hereof shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in the
second municipal corporation.
   (E)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may by regulation provide.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 860.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
860.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
860.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
860.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
860.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
860.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
860.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
860.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
860.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
 860.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of Village
of Loudonville's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual
shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable

income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F) If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return under divisions (A), (B), or (C) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a Tax Administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under

extension under division (B) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
860.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

Section
860.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
860.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
                (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
860.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
860.10 of this Chapter.

   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
860.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
860.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
860.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
860.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
860.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
       (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
 860.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
       (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed
by the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is
no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or another representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties    and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment file with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
860.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
860.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
860.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
860.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 39-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
860.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (b)    "Transient accommodation" means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping

   (d)    "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel

      (Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    There is hereby levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging
by hotel or transient accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient
guests. The tax is three percent (3%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time
the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax
does not apply to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political
subdivisions, or any charitable organizations for the lodging of transient
indigent individuals, when such charitable organization pays the hotel or
transient accommodation for such lodging.
   (b)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent evasion of the tax it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels
or transient accommodations is subject to the tax until the contrary is
established.
(Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)    The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable
on each taxable lodging.
   (b)    If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies. (Ord.
39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.04 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection by an authorized representative of the
Village and shall be preserved for a period of four years unless the authorized
representative, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period,
or by order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.05 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Each vendor shall on or before the twentieth day of each month make
and file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Income
Fiscal Officer, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the Village for the period covered by the return and
such other information as the Income Fiscal Officer deems necessary for the
proper administration of this chapter. The Income Fiscal Officer may extend the
time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by mailing the same
to the Income Fiscal Officer, together with payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon.
   (b)    The Income Fiscal Officer may authorize vendors whose tax liability
is not such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Income Fiscal
Officer upon the basis of administrative costs to the Village, to make and file
returns at less frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and
shall indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)    The Income Fiscal Officer shall stamp or otherwise make on all
returns the date received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or
otherwise the amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails
to file a return under this chapter shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit
and pay into the Village Treasury the sum of one dollar ($1.00).
   (d)    The Income Fiscal Officer, if he deems it necessary in order to
insure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and
payments to be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed
by the vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.06 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner. (Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.07 REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)    No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)    If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Income Fiscal Officer to file returns at less
frequent intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Income
Fiscal Officer may:
      (1)   Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by
the Income Fiscal Officer from a review of returns or other information
pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Income Fiscal Officer, conditioned upon
payment of the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be
filed within ten days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the
Income Fiscal Officer of its requirements.
      (2)    A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned
to the vendor, if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date
the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
         (Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.08 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the Village under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 39-2006. Passed 9-18-06.)
870.09 INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent
(3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.09, and
further, to levy an excise tax of three percent (3%) on transactions by which

purposes and so as to be consistent with any requirement of law compliance with
which is a prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied

reason of its nature, is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines,
water lines or other public improvements, or which is infected with any
injurious fungus or insect or other pest. This section does not prohibit the
planting of street trees by adjacent property owners, provided that the
selection and location of such trees is in accordance with Sections
1012.02 through
1012.05.

the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees
under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are
impractical, may be exempted from this section at the determination of the
Village Tree Commission. (Ord. 32-86. Passed 8-18-86.)

intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above the
surface of the street or sidewalk. Such owner shall remove all dead, diseased
or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the
safety of the public. The Village may prune any tree or shrub on private
property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street
from a street light or when it interferes with the visibility of any traffic
control device or sign.
(Ord. 32-86. Passed 8-18-86.)
1012.08 REMOVAL OF STUMPS.

1012.09 INTERFERENCE WITH VILLAGE TREE COMMISSION.
   No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with the Village Tree
Commission while it is engaged in the execution or enforcement of this chapter.
However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as an attempt to prohibit
the pursuit of any remedy, legal or equitable, in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the protection of property rights by the owner of any property
in the Municipality.
(Ord. 32-86. Passed 8-18-86.)
1012.10 LICENSE REQUIRED FOR PRUNING OR REMOVING; EXCEPTIONS; FEE; INSURANCE.
   No person shall engage in the business or occupation of pruning, treating or
removing street or park trees in the Village without first applying for and
procuring a license to do so. The license fee shall be five dollars ($5.00)
annually, paid in advance. However, no license shall be required of any public
service company or Village employee doing such work in the pursuit of its or
his or her public service endeavors. Before any license is issued, each
applicant shall first file evidence of possession of liability insurance in the
minimum amounts of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for bodily injury and one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for property damage, indemnifying the
Village or any person from injuries or damages resulting from the pursuit of
such endeavors.
(Ord. 32-86. Passed 8-18-86.)
1012.11 APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   Council may review the conduct, acts and decisions of the Village Tree
Commission. Any person may appeal from any ruling or order of the Commission to
Council, which may hear the matter and make a final decision. Such appeal must
be filed with the Village Clerk-Treasurer within ten days of the ruling or
order of the Commission. Council shall conduct a hearing upon such appeal at
the next regularly scheduled Council meeting following the filing of the
appeal.
(Ord. 32-86. Passed 8-18-86.)
1012.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.

(Ord. 69-91. Passed 9-16-91.)
1024.07 DESIGN.
   (a)    Grade; Bends. Sanitary sewerage lines shall have a uniform grade and
be straight between manholes. No bends will be permitted between manholes.
   (b)    Minimum Size. No sewerage line extension shall be less than six
inches in diameter.
 
   (c)    Depth. Minimum depth of sewers shall be as approved.
   (d)    Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean
velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second. The
following are minimum slopes to be provided:
 
Sewer Size Minimum Slope in Feet Per 100 Feet
6 inch     0.60
8 inch     0.40
10 inch    0.28
12 inch    0.22
   (e)    Erosion Protection. Where velocities greater than fifteen feet per
second are obtained, special provision shall be made to protect against
displacement by erosion and shock.
   (f)    Manhole Location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each
line; at all changes in grade, size or alignment; at all intersections; and at
distances not greater than 400 feet. Lampholes may be used for special
conditions, but shall not be substituted for manholes or installed at the end
of laterals greater than 150 feet in length.
   (g)    Drop Pipe. A drop pipe should be provided for a sewer entering a
manhole at an elevation of twenty-four inches or more above the manhole invert.
(Ord. 870. Passed 2-3-64.)
1024.08 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Licensing of Contractors. Before a contractor can commence sewerage
line construction within the Village, he must first obtain a license as
required under Section
1020.03 .
   (b)    Preparation of Trenches. Except in rock, water-bearing earth or where
granular fill or concrete is to be used, mechanical excavation of trenches
shall be stopped above the final invert grade elevation so that the pipe may be
laid on a firm undisturbed earth bed. The bottom portion of the trench shall
then be hand excavated to conform to the shape of the pipe barrel, and bell
holes dug so that after placement only the barrel of the pipe bears on the
trench bottom. If over- digging occurs, all loose dirt must be removed and the
trench bottom brought to grade with granular material.
   A four-inch minimum foundation of granular material must be used in trenches
where rock or water-bearing earth is encountered and may also be placed under
the pipe in lieu of hand excavating for the pipe barrel and bell holes at the
contractor's option. Trenches shall be dry when the trench bottom is prepared.
   The width of trenches shall be such as to provide adequate space for workmen
to place and join the pipe properly, but in every case the trench shall be kept
to a minimum width.
   The contractor shall be responsible for installing all necessary sheeting
and bracing to support the walls of the trench and existing structures.
   (c)    Pipe Laying. Pipe shall be protected during handling against impact,
shocks and free fall, and shall be kept clean at all times. All pipes are to be
laid in accordance with lines and grades shown on the drawings and shall start
at the low point with hub ends laid upgrade. Preparatory to making pipe joints,
all surfaces of the portions of the pipe to be jointed or of the factory-made
jointing material shall be clean and dry. Lubricants, primers, adhesives, etc.,
shall be used as recommended by the pipe or joint manufacturer's
specifications. As soon as possible after the joint is made, sufficient
backfill material shall be placed along each side of the pipe to hold it in
place.
   The contractor shall use a top line and plumb bob to insure proper
alignment, and he shall maintain three batter boards at all times to check the
grade of the sewer. At the end of each day's work a vitrified stopper shall be
placed in the line.
   (d)    Laying Fittings. Branches of wyes shall be inclined at approximately
forty-five degrees to the horizontal and the top and sides shall be covered
with four inches of granular material. Ends of wye branches which are not to be
immediately used will be sealed with vitrified clay stoppers tightly cemented
in place, and marked with a two-inch by two-inch board extending from the wye
branch to approximately one foot below ground surface. Bends and risers for
drop manholes shall be encased in concrete.
   (e)    Backfilling. No backfilling over completed structures shall be done
without permission of the Inspector. All trenches shall be backfilled as soon
as possible after the pipe is laid, inspected, tested and approved by the Sewer
and Plumbing Inspector.
   Materials for backfilling shall be reasonable free from rubbish, muck,
stones exceeding one cubic foot in volume and other unsuitable materials, and
the contractor shall provide satisfactory filling material.
   For a height of eighteen inches above the top of the pipe, the backfill
shall be composed of fine material, free from stones and an excess of water,
and shall be placed completely under the pipe haunches and thoroughly tamped
with satisfactory tamping equipment. All trenches which lie in roadways or
driveways shall be compacted in eight-inch layers (loose depth) or filled with
suitable granular material for the full depth of the trench as required.
Puddling of trenches shall not be allowed without permission of the Inspector.
   (f)    Manhole Construction. All manholes shall be thoroughly bonded to the
barrel of the sewer. The upper portion of manholes over six feet in depth,
beginning at a point five feet eight inches below the top, shall be tapered in
evenly and equally on three sides to the proper diameter to receive the
casting. The minimum inside diameter of manholes shall be forty-eight inches,
except where manholes are less than five feet in depth.
   Manhole walls shall be a minimum of eight inches thick, except for precast
concrete. All brick manholes over twelve feet in depth shall have twelve-inch
walls.
   Interior joints of brick manholes shall be pointed and the exterior surface
plastered with a one-inch coat of two to one cement mortar. Inverts shall be
formed of grout and vitrified half- tile.
   (g)    Testing. If there is any doubt as to the quality of workmanship or
the ability of a section of sewerage line to resist leakage, the Village shall
have the authority to require the contractor to perform either an exfiltration
or infiltration test, as determined by the Sewer and Plumbing Inspector. The
test shall be performed in the presence of the Inspector. No sewerage line may
show leakage exceeding 0.75 gallons per hour, per inch of pipe diameter, per
100 feet of pipe.
   The test shall be made between two successive manholes, before any house
connections are made, by closing the lower end of the sewer being tested and
the inlet sewer of the upper manhole, and filling the pipe and manhole with
water. Drop of the water level in the manhole will then be observed. If leakage
in the line exceeds the allowable leakage specified above, the contractor shall
be required to re-excavate and replace the line. Depending upon the grade of
the sewer, the minimum head allowed in the downstream manhole will be four feet
above the invert, and the maximum head for which an exfiltration test is
required is ten feet above the invert of the lower manhole. The minimum depth
of water in the upper manhole shall be one foot above the invert.
   In areas where ground water exists above the top of the sewer, the section
may be tested by an infiltration test. This test shall be conducted by sealing
off the incoming tile in the upper manhole of the section being tested, along
with all wye branches or other openings in the tile, and measuring the quantity
of water which flows over a weir or other suitable measuring device in the
lower manhole.
   (h)    Cleaning Up.  All surplus excavated materials and materials for
construction shall be removed as work progresses. All streets and driveways
shall be rendered suitable, safe and convenient for traffic.
(Ord. 870. Passed 2-3-64.)
1024.09 INSPECTION.
   All sanitary sewerage line materials and workmanship must be checked and
approved by the Sewer and Plumbing Inspector before such work and materials can
be accepted by the Village. No work shall be covered up until the Inspector has
checked and approved it.
(Ord. 870. Passed 2-3-64.)
1024.10 VILLAGE OWNERSHIP; EASEMENTS.
   Upon completion and acceptance of a sanitary sewerage line extension, such
sewerage line, whether on public or private property, shall become and remain
the property of the Village. Where a sewerage line crosses private property,
suitable easements must be granted to the Village to allow for maintenance,
repair and reconstruction of the line. The owner shall guarantee the
workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance
of the work by the Village.
(Ord. 870. Passed 2-3-64.)
1024.11 IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   The owner shall give a full construction performance bond, executed by a
surety or sureties satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs, or
a certified check, guaranteeing the completion of the improvements within one
year or a reasonable period of time, as fixed by the Board. This bond or check
shall be in an amount equal to the Engineer's estimated cost of completing
improvements. If not completed as agreed upon, the bond shall be forfeited, and
the money collected from the bonds shall be used for no other purpose. Any
funds remaining after completion of the work shall be returned to the original
depositor or surety company.
(Ord. 870. Passed 2-3-64.)
1024.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or
continues.

1028.01 SEWER REVENUE FUND.
   There is hereby established a separate and special fund designated as the
Loudonville Sewerage System Revenue Fund into which all revenue collected under
the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited. The Fund shall be used and
administered only as hereafter provided by Council. (Ord. 662. Passed 3-17-58.)
1028.02 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES; LATE PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Beginning on August 1, 2006, a rental will be charged by the Village
for service rendered by its sanitary sewerage system equal to eighty-two
percent (82%) of the water rates according to the actual consumption and
collection thereof to be made on the September 10, 2006 and monthly thereafter.
This rental fee shall be assessed to Village residents as well as the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for services rendered to the Mohican
State Park.
   (b)   Users of sewer only, the rates will be eighty-two percent (82%) of the
existing rate. However, the Board of Trustees of the Board of Public Affairs
may require any sewer user at his or her own expense to meter the water used
and the charges made by the Village to such user shall be calculated upon the
same basis as if the water had been supplied through the Village water mains.
(Ord. 26-2006. Passed 7-17-06.)
   (c)   If any sewer user consumes water supplied by Village water mains and
all or a portion of such water is not discharged into the Village sanitary
sewerage system, such sewer user may, at his expense, either meter the water
which is not discharged into the sanitary sewerage system or meter the water
which is discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, and the charges made by
the Village to such sewer user shall be calculated upon the volume of water
discharged into the sanitary sewerage system.
   (d)   If any sewer bill is not paid within ten days after the date of
mailing, a ten percent (10%) surcharge shall be added. Because the foregoing
rates are based on water consumption, the Village will not accept payment of
any water bill unless the sewer service bill is also paid, and if any bill for
sewer service remain unpaid for thirty days, the Village may cut off the water
supply to the delinquent user until the sewer bill is paid. In addition, the
Village may certify all delinquent charges and surcharges to the County Auditor
to be collected in the same manner as other Municipal taxes under the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 729.49.
   (e)   The foregoing rates are minimum rates not maximum rates and the
Village reserves the right to increase the same at any time should the revenue
of the system be insufficient to repay Federal financing or to operate the
secondary system.
(Ord. 662. Passed 3-17-58; Ord. 1170. Passed 11-24-70; Ord. 55-93. Passed 7-6-
93; Ord. 40- 94. Effective 12-1-94.)
1028.03 SUSPENSION OF CHARGES.
   Council may suspend the imposition and collection of that portion of the
sewer rental charge necessary to meet payments to the Ohio Water Development
Authority and/or the debt service charges for any period of time during which
funds from other sources are available in sufficient amounts to meet such
payments. If funds from other sources are available but not in sufficient
amounts to meet such payments, so much of the sewer rental charge as is
necessary to meet such payments may be imposed. (Ord. 1170. Passed 11-24-70.)
1028.04 PLACE OF PAYMENT.
   The sewer rental charges shall be payable at the office of the Clerk-
Treasurer located in the Village Hall. (Ord. 662. Passed 3-17-58.)
1028.05 LIABILITY OF OWNERS AND LESSEES.
   The owner of property which is served by the sanitary sewerage system by
pipes connected with the system, as well as the lessee of such premises, shall
be liable to the Municipality for all sanitary sewerage service rendered to
such premises.
(Ord. 662. Passed 3-17-58.)

1032.08 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Licensing of Contractor. Before a contractor can commence water line
construction within the Village, he must first obtain a license as required
under Section
1020.03 .
   (b)    Preparation of Trenches. Except in rock, water-bearing earth or where
granular fill or concrete is to be used, mechanical excavation of trenches
shall be stopped above the final invert grade elevation so that the pipe may be
laid on a firm, undisturbed earth bed. The bottom portion of the trench shall
then be hand excavated to conform to the shape of the pipe barrel, and bell
holes dug so that after placement only the barrel of the pipe bears on the
trench bottom. If over- digging occurs, all loose dirt must be removed and the
trench brought to grade with granular material.
   A four-inch minimum foundation of granular material must be used in trenches
where rock or water-bearing earth is encountered and may also be placed under
the pipe in lieu of hand excavating for the pipe barrel and bell holes at the
contractor's option. Trenches shall be dry when the trench bottom is prepared.
   The width of trenches shall be such as to provide adequate space for workmen
to place and joint the pipe properly, but in every case the trench shall be
kept to a minimum width.
The contractor shall be responsible for installing all necessary sheeting and
bracing to support the walls of the trench and existing structures.
   (c)    Pipe Laying. Pipe shall be protected during handling against impact,
shocks and free fall, and shall be kept clean at all times. Block or brick
shall not be used under the pipe except as temporary blocking. Before any pipe
and fittings are placed in the trench, they shall be checked for defects by the
Sewer and Plumbing Inspector.
   All pipe shall be installed with a minimum cover of four feet.
   Hydrants shall be set on a concrete or concrete block base and braced on the
side opposite the branch opening by concrete or a concrete bearing block
extending to solid earth. Approximately one-half yard of coarse gravel shall be
placed under and around the base of the hydrant to allow for escape of the
drain water.
   (d)    Blocking. At all changes in direction of the pipe, a concrete block
shall be poured or placed between the pipe and the undisturbed wall of the
trench to prevent lateral deflection of the pipe.
   (e)    Backfilling. No backfilling over completed structures shall be done
without permission of the Inspector. All joints shall be left exposed until the
pipe has been tested.
   Materials for backfilling shall be reasonably free from rubbish, muck,
stones exceeding one cubic foot in volume, and other unsuitable materials, and
the contractor shall provide satisfactory filling materials.
   For a height of eighteen inches above the top of the pipe, the backfill
shall be composed of fine material free from stones and an excess of water, and
shall be placed completely under the pipe haunches and thoroughly tamped with
satisfactory tamping equipment. All trenches which lie in roadways or driveways
shall be compacted in eight-inch layers (loose depth) or filled with suitable
granular material for the full depth of the trench, as required. Puddling of
trenches shall not be allowed without permission of the Sewer and Plumbing
Inspector.
   (f)   Disinfection. Water lines shall be disinfected according to the
"Procedure for Disinfecting Water Mains" prepared by the A.W.W.A.
   (g)    Testing. A hydrostatic test, in accordance with the recommendations
of the Cast- Iron Pipe Research Association and outlined in their Handbook of
Cast-Iron Pipe, shall be made on all completed water lines. The test pressure
shall equal the pressure under which the line will operate, plus fifty percent.
Allowable leakage shall not exceed the amount specified in the A.W.W.A.
specification for installation of cast-iron water mains (C-600-49T). All labor,
material and equipment necessary to properly conduct the test shall be
furnished by the contractor. (Ord. 871. Passed 2-3-64.)
1032.09 INSPECTION.
   All water line materials and workmanship must be checked and approved by the
Sewer and Plumbing Inspector before such work and materials can be accepted by
the Village. No work shall be covered up until the Inspector has checked and
approved
(Ord. 871. Passed 2-3-64.)
1032.10 VILLAGE OWNERSHIP; EASEMENTS.
   Upon completion and acceptance of a water line extension, such water line,
whether on public or private property, shall become and remain the property of
the Village. Where a water line crosses private property, suitable easements
must be granted to the Village to allow for maintenance, repair and
reconstruction of the water line. The owner shall guarantee the workmanship and
materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the work by
the Village. (Ord. 871. Passed 2-3-64.)
1032.11 IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   The owner shall give a full construction performance bond, executed by a
surety or sureties satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs or a
certified check guaranteeing the completion of the improvements within one year
or a reasonable period of time, as fixed by the Board. This bond or check shall
be in an amount equal to the Engineer's estimated cost of completing the
improvement. If not completed as agreed upon, the bond shall be forfeited, and
the money collected from the bonds shall be used for no other purpose. Any
funds remaining after completion of the work shall be returned to the original
depositor or surety company.
(Ord. 871. Passed 2-3-64.)

1032.13 LATE PAYMENTS.
   If any water bill is not paid within ten days after the date of mailing, a
ten percent penalty shall be added. Because the sewer rates are based on water
consumption, the Village will not accept payment of any water bill unless the
sewer service bill is also paid, and if any bill for water service remains
unpaid for thirty days, the Village may cut off the water supply to the
delinquent user until the water bill is paid. (Ord. 1170. Passed 11-24-70.)
1032.14 BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection where by a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply, other than the regular public
water supply of the Village of Loudonville, may enter the supply or

   (nn)    Reserve Strip: A strip of land parallel and abutting a thoroughfare
controlling the means of access on the property.
   (oo)    Reserved Area or Reservation: A parcel of land within a
"subdivision" which is set aside for a specific use, other than residential,
commercial, or industrial.
   (pp)    Right-of-Way: A strip of land taken or dedicated for use as a public
way. In addition to the roadway, it normally incorporates any curbs, lawn
strips, sidewalks, lighting and drainage facilities.
   (qq)   Service Drives: See Street.
   (rr)    Setback Line: A line established by the Subdivision Regulations and/
or the Zoning Code, generally parallel with and measured from the lot line,
defining the limits of a yard in which no building or structure may be located
above ground, except as may be provided.
   (ss)    Subdivision:
      (1)    The division of any parcel of land, shown as a unit or as
contiguous units on the last preceding tax roll, into two or more parcels,
sites or lots, any one of which is less than five acres, for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership, provided, however, that
the division or partition of land into parcels of more than five acres not
involving any new streets or easements of access, and the sale of exchange of
parcels between adjoining lot owners, where such sale or exchange does not
create additional building sites, shall be exempted; or
         (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76.)
      (2)   The improvement of one or more parcels of land for residential,
commercial or industrial structures or groups of structures involving the
division or allocation of land for the opening, widening or extension of any
street or streets, except private streets serving industrial structures; the
division or allocation of land as open spaces for common use by owners,
occupants or lease holders, or as easements for the extension and maintenance
of public sewer, water, storm drainage or other public facilities.
         (Ord. 18-83. Passed 3-21-83; Ord. 51-90. Passed 6-4-90.)
   (tt)    Subdivider: See Developer.
   (uu)    Street or Road: A right-of-way which affords the principal means of
access to abutting property and which has been dedicated or deeded to the
public use and accepted by the Village. Streets shall be further defined as
follows:
      (1)    Boulevard: A "street" or "road" on which traffic flow is divided
into each direction by a median strip which is usually landscaped with grass
and plantings. A "Boulevard" may serve the function of an "arterial
thoroughfare," "collector thoroughfare," or "local street," depending on its
relationship within the overall transportation system.
      (2)    Collector Thoroughfare: A "street" or "road" which is intended to
collect traffic from "local streets" within a neighborhood and channel it onto
the arterial system, or conversely to distribute traffic from the arterial
system to the "local streets." Access to abutting properties is equal in
importance to the movement of through traffic.
      (3)    Cul-de-sac: A street having one outlet open to vehicular traffic
and the other end permanently terminated by a vehicular turn-around.
      (4)    Dead-end Street: A street temporarily having one outlet open to
vehicular traffic and not provided with a permanent vehicular turn-around.
      (5)    Industrial-Commercial Street: A "street" or "road" intended to be
utilized in an area zoned industrial or commercial and intended to carry heavy
vehicular traffic serving primarily light or heavy industrial and commercial
establishments.
      (6)    Local Street: A "street" which is intended primarily to provide
access to abutting properties. Through traffic should be discouraged on "local
streets." All streets not otherwise designated shall be designated as "local
streets."
      (7)    Major Arterial Thoroughfare: A "street" or "road" which is
intended to carry the major portion of traffic entering or leaving an urban
area and also significant intra-urban travel such as between communities or
between major urban centers. Major arterials should from the boundaries of
residential neighborhoods, but should not penetrate those neighborhoods. Access
or service to abutting properties is a secondary function to the provision of
travel service. Parking and loading are discouraged.
      (8)    Marginal Access Street: Minor "street" which is parallel to and
adjacent to arterial streets and highways and which serves to reduce the number
of access points to the arterial streets and thereby increase traffic safety.
      (9)    Minor Arterial Thoroughfare: A "street" or "road" which is
intended to connect with and augment the major arterial system. The function of
the minor arterial system is to provide travel service to trips of moderate
length and provide intra-community continuity. "Minor Arterial Thoroughfares,"
are a lower level of travel service than "Major Arterial Thoroughfares," but
access to abutting properties is still a secondary function to the movement of
through traffic. Minor arterial thoroughfares should also form the boundaries
of neighborhoods but not penetrate the neighborhood. Parking and loading should
be discouraged.
      (10)    Private Street: A "street" or "road" that is not dedicated for
public ownership or maintenance and which is to be maintained by an association
of property owners or through other private means.
      (11)    Service Drives: A "street" providing access to property which
abuts or is adjacent to minor or major thoroughfares.
   (vv)    Thoroughfare Plan: A plan prepared by the Planning Commission and
adopted by the legislative body, showing the accurate location, grade and width
of existing or proposed streets.
   (ww)    Variance: A variance is a modification of the strict terms of these
Subdivision Regulations where such modification will not be contrary to the
public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not
the result of the action of the applicant, a literal enforcement of these
Regulations would result in unnecessary and undue hardship.

1224.01 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF TYPE I SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever a division of a tract of land meets the criteria stated for Type I
subdivisions in Section
1220.03, the procedure for approval of such division shall be as follows:
   (a)    The owner of the tract of land and/or his or her agent shall have
prepared by a registered surveyor an accurate drawing to a scale not less than
one inch equals fifty feet, or to such other scale acceptable to the Planning
Commission, showing the following:
      (1)    The name and address of the owner(s) and the name of the
registered surveyor who prepared the drawing.
      (2)    Date, approximate north point and graphic scale.
      (3)    The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, watercourses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes,
water mains and any public utility easements on the land to be subdivided.
      (4)    The locations, widths and other dimensions of proposed easements,
parks and other open spaces, reservations, lot lines, building lines and
utilities.
      (5)    The acreage of each individual parcel being created by the
division.
      (6)    Plans for any (if any) proposed individual water supply or sewage
disposal system. This may be on or attached to the drawing. These plans are not
required if Village water and sewer systems are to be used.
      (7)    Review statement (on or attached to required drawing), signature
and date of review by the designated representative of the County Board of
Health, commenting upon the adequacy of any (if any) proposed individual water
supply and sewage disposal system; commenting upon the topography and soil
conditions, the proposed size of lots, the number of lots in the general
vicinity, and other matters which may affect the operations of individual
sewage disposal systems; and commenting upon any serious health hazard that the
approval of the subdivision may create. This statement is not required when
Village water and sewer facilities are to be used.
   In making such review, the County Board of Health may require whichever
information it deems necessary to be provided by the owner, of the parcel(s) or
tract(s) of land shown on the subdivision or his or her agent.
   (b)    The owner or his or her agent shall provide the Planning Commission's
authorized representative with the original drawing. If the authorized
representative is satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to
Chapter
1226 or other applicable platting, subdividing or zoning regulations, and that
approval of such subdivision will not create or lead to the creation of any
serious health threat, he or she shall, within seven working days after
submission, approve such division and shall stamp the original drawing of the
same "Approved by the Loudonville Planning Commission; no plat required" and
attach his or her signature. If such division is not approved, the reasons for
such action shall be stated to the owner and/or his or her agent in writing.
All applications and subsequent action taken on such subdivisions shall be
reported to the Planning Commission at the following regular meeting of the
Planning Commission.
   If the owner of the property and/or his or her agent disagrees with the
decision or requirements specified by the authorized representative, he or she
may then appeal to the Planning Commission.
   Once approval is granted by the authorized representative acting for the
Planning Commission, or by the Planning Commission, the original drawing shall
be filed with the County Recorder as the official drawing of record. Failure to
file such approved drawing within one year of such approval shall void the
approval.
   To prevent the many development problems that occur from subdividing land
along existing roadways on a piecemeal basis, the following regulations shall
apply:
      (1)    No owner of any parcel of land as shown on the tax maps at the
time of adoption of these Subdivision Regulations shall subdivide such land
into more than five lots of less than five acres as a Type I subdivision.
      (2)    No frontage of any existing street shall be subdivided to the
extent that less than fifty percent of the original parcel frontage, as shown
on the tax maps at the time of adoption of these Subdivision Regulations, is
retained as a part of such original parcel, unless exempted by the Planning
Commission.
Whenever a proposed subdivision of land exceeds any of the above limitations,
such subdivision of land shall follow the procedure for plat approval for Type
II subdivisions. Exceptions to the above may be granted by the Planning
Commission only when it can be clearly shown that platting under the procedure
for Type II subdivisions would be of no value in obtaining better subdivision
of the land.
         (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1224.02 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF TYPE II SUBDIVISIONS.
   The procedure for review and approval of Type II subdivisions consists of
two separate steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission to the
Planning Commission of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. The
second step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a
final plat together with required certificates. This final plat becomes the
instrument to be recorded in the office of the Recorder of the County when duly
signed by the Chairperson of the Planning Commission
   The subdivider and/or his or her agent should consult early and informally
with the Planning Commission or its authorized representative for advice and
assistance before the preparation of the preliminary plat and its formal
application for approval. This will enable him or her to become thoroughly
familiar with these Regulations and other official plans or public improvements
which might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary
and costly revisions.
   (a)    Preliminary Plat.
      (1)    At least ten days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission eight copies
of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision drawn to a scale of not less
than one inch equals 100 feet along with complete existing topographic
information of the site.
   Upon receipt of the copies of the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission
shall forward copies of the preliminary plat to the County Board of Health, the
Ashland Soil Conservation District, the Fire Department, the Board of Trustees
of Public Affairs and the Street Commissioner, for the purpose of study and
recommendation. These officials shall be informed of the meeting date at which
the preliminary subdivision plat is to be considered and requested to make a
report on such subdivision to the Planning Commission by or on such date. (Ord.
06-2007. Passed 2-19-07.)
      (2)    The preliminary plat, which shall meet the minimum standards of
design and the general requirements for the construction of improvements as set
forth in Chapters
1226 and
1228, shall give the following information insofar as possible:
         A.    The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and address
of the owner or owners, and the name of the registered surveyor who prepared
the plat.
         B.    Date, approximate north point and graphic scale.
         C.    The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, watercourses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes,
water mains, any public utility easements, and the present zoning
classification on the land to be subdivided.
         D.    Plans of proposed utility layouts such as sewers and water, and
easements for all others, showing feasible connections to the existing utility
systems. When such connections are not practicable, any proposed individual
water supply and/or sewage disposal system site must be approved by the County
Board of Health, and any non-Village central water supply and/or sewage
disposal system site shall be approved by the State Health Department prior to
approval of the preliminary plat.
         E.    The names, locations, widths and other dimensions of proposed
streets, alleys, easements, parks and other open spaces, reservations, lot
lines, building lines and utilities.
         F.    Contours at vertical intervals of not more than five feet.
         G.    Plans for minimizing erosion and sediment on the land to be
developed, unless exempted by the Planning Commission.
         H.    Location sketch maps showing relationship of subdivision site to
area.
      (3)    In addition to the preliminary plat the subdivider shall submit
any proposed covenants and restrictions; plans or written statements regarding
street trees or planted areas, parks and playgrounds where applicable; plans
and any written statements regarding location and construction plans of water
supply, sewage disposal, surface drainage, sedimentation and erosion control
and flood control; and profiles of streets as required by the Planning
Commission. The subdivider shall also submit an area plan, except when not
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, showing how the adjacent land area
can be subdivided in subsequent development phases and how it could relate to
the proposed subdivision.
      (4)    Within thirty days after submission of the preliminary plat to the
Planning Commission or its representative or within such further time as the
applicant may agree to, the Planning Commission will review it and indicate its
approval, disapproval, or approval subject to modifications, as a basis for the
preparation of the final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such
disapproval will be stated in writing. The grounds for disapproval, including
citation of or reference to the rule or regulation violated by the plat, shall
be entered in the minutes of the Commission and the refusal endorsed on at
least one of the plats. If approved subject to modifications, the nature of the
required modification will be indicated.
      (5)    After acceptance of the preliminary plat for review by the
Planning Commission or its authorized representative, failure of the Planning
Commission to act on the preliminary plat within thirty days or within such
further time as the applicant may agree to will be deemed approval of this
plat.
       (6)    The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission
will not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on
the preliminary plat.
       (7)    One copy of the preliminary plat will be retained in the Planning
Commission files, and one copy will be returned to the subdivider with any
notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific changes, if
any, required.
      (8)    The approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless a final
plat based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such approval
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning
Commission.
   (b)    Final Plat.
      (1)    The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat
as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he or she proposes to record and
develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all
requirements of these Regulations.
      (2)    At least ten days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered the subdivider shall submit the original drawing and three copies
(blackline or blueline prints), together with any street profiles or other
plans that may be required by the Planning Commission.
   The plat shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet and
preferably fifty feet to the inch where possible, unless otherwise approved by
the Planning Commission or its authorized representative. Drawings must be
drawn in India or permanent ink on tracing cloth or permanent reproducible
material.
   When the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission, one copy will be
returned to the subdivider and one copy will be sent to the County Recorder,
both with the approval of the Planning Commission certified thereon. One copy
shall be retained in the Planning Commission files. The original tracing
containing the certification of the Planning Commission will be filed with the
County Engineer. If the subdivider wishes to retain the original tracing, he or
she must provide a duplicate permanent transparency acceptable to the County
Engineer.
      (3)    The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove this final
plat within thirty days after its submission to the Planning Commission or its
authorized representative. Failure of the Planning Commission to act on this
final plat within these thirty days shall be deemed approval of it. If the plat
is disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the records of
the Planning Commission.
      (4)    Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any street or
other public way or ground.
      (5)    The final plat shall show:
         A.    The line of all streets and roads, alley lines, lot lines,
building setback lines, lots numbered in numerical order, reservations,
easements, and any areas to be dedicated to public use or sites for other than
residential use with notes stating their purpose and any limitations.
         B.    Sufficient data to determine readily and reproduce on the ground
the location, bearing and length of every street line, lot line, boundary line,
block line and building line, whether curved or straight, and including the
north point. This shall include complete curve data on all curve lines.
         C.    All dimensions to the nearest one hundredth of a foot and angles
to the nearest minute.
         D.    Location and description of monuments.
         E.    The names and locations of adjoining subdivisions and streets
and the location and ownership of adjoining unsubdivided property.
         F.    A list of agreements and appropriate guarantees, if required by
the Planning Commission, stating provisions that will be made for sedimentation
and erosion control.
         G.    A list of all restrictions and covenants, if any, the developer
intends to include in the deeds to the lots in the subdivision.
         H.    Date, title, name and location of the subdivision, graphic scale
and north point.
         I.    Location sketch map showing site in relation to the area.
         J.    Certification showing that applicant is the land owner and
dedicates streets, rights of way and any sites for public use.

1226.01 STREETS.
   (a)    Conformity to the Thoroughfare Plan. The location and width of all
streets and roads shall conform to any Thoroughfare Plan adopted by the
Planning Commission and to good design practices which take into consideration
the topography of the land, natural features and other assets which will
enhance the environment of the subdivision and surrounding development.
   (b)    Relation to adjoining Street System. The proposed street system shall
extend existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case less than
the required minimum width, unless exempted for good reason by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)    Street Widths. The minimum width of a right of way, measured from lot
line to lot line, shall be as follows:
      (1)    Major streets, sixty feet. Major streets are those which are
described in the Land Use Plan and those determined by the Planning Commission
to be streets which need a sixty-foot right of way. These may include the
principal entrance street of a residential development and streets for major
circulation within such a development if determined necessary by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)    Minor streets, fifty feet. Minor streets are those which are used
primarily for access to abutting residential properties and which are designed
to discourage their use by through traffic.
      (3)    Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs), fifty feet. Cul-de-sacs are
permanent dead- end minor streets or courts designed so that they cannot be
extended in the future.
       (4)    Alleys, twenty feet. Alleys are minor public ways used primarily
for service access.
   In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a street of the
required minimum width impractical, the Planning Commission may modify the
above requirements. Through business areas it may be required that the street
widths be increased ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without
interference with normal passing traffic.
   (d)    Additional Width of Existing Streets. Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional right of way to meet the above
minimum street width requirements.
      (1)    The entire right of way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
      (2)    When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one- half of the required right of way, measured from the centerline of
the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting right-
of- way width be less than forty feet.
   
   (e)    Street Grades. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven
percent. Grades on minor streets may exceed seven percent but not ten percent.
In hillside areas with an average slope of ten percent or more, the slope may
be increased to fifteen percent, but only for short and straight stretches and
upon approval of the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Horizontal Curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees
in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonable long radius shall be
introduced. On major streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall be not
less than 300 feet; on minor streets not less than 100 feet. In hillside areas
with an average slope of ten percent or more, the centerline radius of
curvature may be reduced to not less than 200 feet on major streets and to not
less than seventy- five feet on minor streets, upon approval of the Planning
Commission.
   (g)    Vertical Curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of minimum length in feet equal to fifteen times the algebraic
difference in rates of grade for major streets and one-half this minimum length
for minor streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades
drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one
inch equals twenty feet vertical, may be required by the Planning Commission.
In hillside areas with an average slope of ten percent or more this minimum
length may be further decreased upon approval of the Planning Commission.
   (h)    Street Elevations. The Planning Commission shall not approve any
streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be
located at elevations which will make them flood free in order that portions of
the subdivisions will not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist,
the Planning Commission shall require street profiles and elevations in order
to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76.)
   (i)    Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as is possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than
eight degrees.
   Curb line radii at street intersections of two minor streets shall not be
less than ten feet nor greater than twenty feet. Larger curb radii may be
required at other types of intersections. Wherever necessary to permit the
construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing width, the
property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back
sufficiently to permit such construction.
   All streets entering on a heavily traveled street shall have a sufficient
safe sight distance and in no case less than 350 feet.
   All driveways shall be more than thirty feet from any street intersection.
(Ord. 18-83. Passed 3-21-83.)
   (j)    Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on major streets. In hillside areas with an average
slope of ten percent or more, this requirement for major streets may be reduced
to fifty feet subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. There shall
be no tangent requirement for reverse curves on minor streets unless required
by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76.)
   (k)    Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall not be allowed except in cases where warranted by unusual topography
or other circumstances and subject to approval of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 2-19-07.)
      
   (l)    Dead End Streets.
      (1)    Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end
permanently closed shall be no more than 1,000 feet long. They shall be
provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway
diameter of at least eighty feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least
120 feet. When dead-end streets are not more than 200 feet long, "T" type or
other types of turnarounds not requiring the use of private property may be
utilized when approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)    Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable
to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end streets
shall be provided with a temporary and appropriate turn-around subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (m)    Private Streets and Reserve Strips. Every subdivided property shall
be served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips
controlling access to streets except where the control of such strips is
definitely placed with the Village under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (n)    Street Names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In
no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, driveway,
place or court.
   (o)    Alleys. Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions,
except where justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in
commercial and industrial districts if other provisions cannot be made for
adequate service access.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.02 BLOCKS.
   (a)    Length. Blocks shall not be less than 400 nor more than 1,200 feet in
length, except as the Planning Commission may permit to secure efficient use of
the land or desired features of street pattern. In blocks over 800 feet in
length, the Planning Commission may require one or more public crosswalks of
not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at
locations deemed necessary.
   (b)    Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets, where adjoining
undeveloped land, or where prevented by topographical conditions or size of the
property, in which case the Planning Commission will approve a single tier of
lots of minimum depth.
   (c)    Irregular Shapes. Irregular shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-
sacs or loop streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may
be approved by the Planning Commission if properly designed and located and if
maintenance of interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.03 LOTS.
   (a)    Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must
front upon a public street or road right of way which is not less than fifty
feet in width.
   (b)    Public Sewer Required on Lots Where Accessible. Where a public
sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such
sewer and provide a connection to each lot. Where a public sewer is not
accessible, an alternative method of sewage disposal may be used, when meeting
all applicable public health regulations.
   (c)    Minimum Size.
      (1)    Residential lots not served by a public sewerage system shall not
be less than required for private sewage disposal as determined by the County
Board of Health or the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and approved by the
Planning Commission.
      (2)    The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a private
source of water supply shall be determined by the County Board of Health or the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type or use and development
contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an
overall design of the land to be used for such purpose.
      (4)    The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the
minimum requirements of any zoning ordinance in effect.
      (5)    No lot may have a depth of more than three times the average width
of the lot except as approved by the Planning Commission, or less than 100 feet
in depth.
      (6)    As a minimum guideline all lots on the plat of any subdivision
with central water and sewer systems should have a minimum area of 8,000 square
feet.
      (7)    Subdivisions that will not be served within a guaranteed
reasonable amount of time by a sanitary sewer system should have a minimum lot
area as determined by the County Board of Health or Environmental Protection
Agency and the Planning Commission based on data concerning the soil
characteristics, topography, number or lots and other conditions of the
proposed subdivision.
         (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76.)
   (d)    Minimum Lot Width. No lot shall have less lot width at the building
line than is required by any zoning ordinance applying to the area in which it
is located. No lot shall abut on a street for a distance less than forty feet.
If no greater zoning restriction is in effect, the following minimum lot width
requirements shall be met: commercial, 100 feet; industrial, 200 feet.
(Ord. 18-83. Passed 3-21-83.)
   (e)    Building Setback Lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines
from the street right of way shall not be less than thirty feet and, in the
case of corner lots, thirty feet from the side street, unless a lower standard
is allowed by an existing zoning ordinance.
   Building setback lines from the street right of way on all U.S. and State
highways and/or major streets shall not be less than one-half the existing or
proposed right-of-way width, whichever is greater.
   (f)    Corner Lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to
permit the additional side yard requirements of any zoning ordinance or
building setback lines outlined in the previous subsection. (Ord. 75-96. Passed
11-18-96)
1226.04 PUBLIC USE AND SERVICE AREA.
   Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located
and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as
well as public service areas.
   (a)    Public Open Space. Where a school, neighborhood park or recreation
area, or public access to water frontage, shown in a plan made and adopted by
the Planning Commission, is located in whole or in part in the applicant's
subdivision, or is desirable, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
Planning Commission may require the reservation of such open space within the
subdivision for park, school or recreation purposes for up to two years to
achieve acquisition by the appropriate agency.
   (b)    Easements for Utilities. The Planning Commission may require
easements, not exceeding twelve feet in width, for poles, wires, conduits,
storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains or other utility lines,
along all rear lot lines and/or along all side lot lines if necessary.
Easements of the same or greater width may be required along the lines of or
across lots, where necessary for the extension of existing or planned
utilities.
   (c)    Setback Lines. Setback lines shall be located or increased as
necessary so as to allow proper area for private sewage disposal installation
where no central sewage system is available, and the private sewage disposal
system would be located between the front of the house and the road right of
way.
   (d)    Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide an adequate easement as determined by the Planning Commission and/or
its authorized representative along each side of the stream for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating or protecting the stream for drainage or public
use.
   (e)    Community Assets. In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical spots and
similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value
to the property and community.
   (f)    Utility Easements. Electric, telephone and cable TV lines shall be
buried if located at the front of the lots. Easements along side or rear lot
lines will normally be centered on the lot line and a minimum of sixteen feet
wide. When located adjacent to property not owned by the subdivider, the
subdivider will either secure an easement of appropriate width from the
abutting property owner or take the entire easement width from the property
being subdivided.
   (g)    Drainage Wav Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage way, a public easement conforming substantially with the lines of the
drainage way shall be provided. The easement shall be twenty feet (20') wide or
of such further width as necessary to provide at least a ten foot (10') clear
area along both sides of the pipe trench or tip of bank for future maintenance
access and shall generally follow side and rear lot lines.
   (h)    Sanitary Sewer Easements. A minimum width of twenty feet (20') shall
be provided. Where lines are exceptionally deep, additional width shall be
provided, i.e., the minimum easement width shall be increased by two feet for
every one foot increase in flow line depth below twelve feet.
      (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96)
1226.05 SUITABILITY OF THE LAND.
   The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from
adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been
determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for
platting and development purposes of the kind proposed.
   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable
shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may
increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood
hazards. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall
not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce
unsatisfactory living conditions.
   The Planning Commission may refuse to approve what is considers to be
scattered or premature subdivision of the land which would involve danger or
injury to the public health, safety, welfare or prosperity by reason of lack of
adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads, and transportation
facilities or other public services, or which would necessitate an excessive
expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.06 LARGE TRACTS OR PARCELS.
   When the land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets
and logical further resubdivision.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.07 GROUP HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.
   A comprehensive group housing development, including large scale
construction of housing units, together with necessary drives and ways of
access, may be approved by the Planning Commission although the design of the
project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision arrangements, if
departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their
intent. (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.08 ZONING OR OTHER REGULATIONS.
   No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning
ordinance will be approved unless it conforms with such ordinance.
   Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions
noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, building code or other
official regulations, the highest standard shall apply. (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-
76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.09 CENTRAL WATER AND SEWER FACILITIES MAY BE REQUIRED.
   (a)    Whenever the County or State Board of Health, or the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, determines, through its review of subdivision
proposals, that any subdivision of land would lead to the creation of any
serious health threat through the use of individual wells and/or individual
sewage disposal systems, no subdivision of land shall be permitted unless
acceptable central or group water and/or sewage disposal systems can be
utilized or constructed that meet all applicable County and State Health
Department or Ohio Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
   (b)    Whenever central water or central sewage disposal systems are
proposed or required that would not utilize existing water supply or sewage
treatment facilities, a site survey and analysis shall be conducted by the
County or State Department of Health, or the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency, to determine the capabilities of central water and sewage disposal
facilities for the site. The site must be approved for the facilities proposed
or required before approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1226.10 HILLSIDE REGULATIONS.
   (a)    General. For the purposes of these Regulations, land with a slope of
twelve percent (12%) or more as indicated by the Soil Survey or field
measurements shall be classified as hillside.
   (b)    Cuts and Fills. Cutting, excavation, grading and filling shall be
permitted where adequate provisions are made to prevent slides and erosion by
cribbing and retaining walls or other measures acceptable to the Planning
Commission.
   (c)    No land shall be graded, cut or filled so as to create a slope
exceeding a vertical rise of one foot (1') for each two and one half feet (2-1/
2') of horizontal distance except water detention or retention facilities when
required.
   (d)    Individual Wastewater Treatment and Disposal. Use of individual
wastewater treatment and disposal systems utilizing soil absorption is not
recommended on hillside slopes. Lots requiring such systems will be permitted
only if design details are approved by applicable health authorities.
(Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96)
1226.11 WETLANDS.
   When a subdivision contains area which could be determined to be a wetland
based on soil type(s), vegetation and/or standing water, the subdivider shall
provide written documentation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers indicating
the existence and extent of any wetland areas along with any mitigation
required to allow development.
(Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96)
1226.12 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (a)    When Required. An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be
required as a supplement to the street and drainage improvement plans. An
erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required for any of the
following:
      (1)    When a proposed development area consists of five (5) or more
acres and earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any
part thereof, the responsible person shall develop and submit for approval a
sediment control plan prior to any earth-disturbing activity. The plan must
contain sediment pollution control practices so that compliance with other
provisions of these Regulations will be achieved during and after development.
      (2)    A copy of the permit from the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) must be provided to the Village for compliance with
EPA regulations and requirements. This permit can be obtained by submitting a
Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The local Soil and Water
Conservation District can be of service for approval of such plans.
      (3)    When a proposed development area involves less than five (5)
acres, it is not necessary to submit a sediment control plan; however, the
responsible person must comply with the other provisions of these Regulations.
All earth-disturbing activities may be subject to surveillance and site
investigation by the local Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) to
determine compliance with these Regulations.
      (4)    A letter is required to be filed with the Village stating that the
development will keep sediment on site and appropriate seeding measures will be
taken to prohibit future erosion of soil.
   (b)    Coordination with other Drainage Plans. Procedures for developing
erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be coordinated with other
provisions of these Regulations.
   (c)    Submission to local SWCD. Three (3) copies of the erosion and
sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the local SWCD. The local Soil
and Water Conservation District shall review and comment on the plans, and may
provide technical assistance to the developer, and Planning Commission.
   (d)    Erosion Control Plan Requirements. The erosion and sedimentation
control plan shall be consistent with the street and drainage improvement
plans, and the criteria of the National Resources Conservation Services
Handbook, "Water Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas," and
shall include:
      (1)    The preliminary plan for the site on which the work is to be
performed.
      (2)    Location of any buildings, structures, utilities, sewers, water
and storm drains on the site where the work is to be performed.
      (3)    Elevations, and/or contours, dimensions, locations, and extent of
all work proposed, and the existing elevation and/or contours of the land.
      (4)    An estimation of the quantity of excavation and fill.
      (5)    Detailed plans of all drainage provisions, retaining walls,
cribbing, vegetative practices, erosion and sediment control measures, location
of fences around sediment basins, steep excavations, or ponding areas, and
other protective devices to be constructed in connection with, or as a part of
the proposed work, together with map showing the drainage areas of land
tributary to the site, and estimated cubic foot per second runoff of the area
served by any drain, computed in accordance with current County storm drainage
criteria.
      (6)    A timing schedule and sequence indicating the anticipated starting
and completion dates of the development sequence: stripping and/or clearing,
rough grading and construction, final grading and vegetative establishment,
seeding mixture and rates for both temporary and permanent seeding, lime and
fertilizer application rates and kind and quantity of mulching, maintenance,
and the time of exposure of each area prior to the completion of effective
erosion and sediment control measures.
      (7)    The estimated cost of the grading and/or filling and the estimated
cost of the required erosion controls.

1228.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The improvements set forth in this chapter are required before final plat
approval or the subdivider shall furnish a guarantee as set forth in these
Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.02 MONUMENTS.
   (a)    Concrete monuments four inches in diameter or square, three feet
long, with flat tops, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where
the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle
points and points of curve of the street right-of-way line and at all corners
on the plat. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify
properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. Concrete
monuments of different construction may be permitted upon written approval of
the Planning Commission or its authorized representative.
   (b)    All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pipe not less than
three-fourths inches in diameter and thirty inches long and driven so as to be
flush with the finished grade or otherwise as approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)    Before final acceptance of the street improvements by the Village,
the subdivider or developer shall, through a registered surveyor, certify to
the Village that all required monuments are in place or that those removed
during construction have been replaced.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.03 GRADING SPECIFICATIONS.
   All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full widths by the
subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks can be constructed. The subgrade
shall be free of sod, vegetative or organic matter, soft clay and other
objectionable materials for a depth of at least two feet below the finished
surface. The subgrade shall be properly rolled, shaped and compacted, and shall
be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission's authorized
representative.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.04 STORM DRAINAGE.
   (a)    A complete storm sewer system and other drainage improvements shall
be constructed in accordance with these standards. Where downstream storm
drainage facilities are inadequate, consideration shall be given to detention
basins, oversized storm sewers, or other techniques to minimize the amount of
runoff developed and to provide a means of controlling the discharge to off-
site outlets.
   (b)    A ten-year storm frequency shall be used in the design of all storm
sewers and ditches, and a twenty-five year frequency shall be used in the
design of major facilities such as culverts and detention facilities.
   (c)    Storm sewer pipes shall conform to the following standards:
      (1)    Minimum size shall be twelve (12) inches.
      (2)    Minimum cover shall be two (2) feet.
      (3)    Minimum grade for smooth pipe shall be as per Table 1.
      (4)    Materials shall consist of reinforced concrete, smooth interior
high density polyethylene, corrugated aluminum, aluminized steel or galvanized
steel, or PVC.
TABLE 1
MINIMUM GRADES "SMOOTH PIPE"
   
   Using an "n" factor of 0.013, the following grades of pipe line shall be
considered MINIMUM:
 
Pipe Size Minimum Grade
(Inches)  (percent)
12        0.33
15        0.23
18        0.18
21        0.14
24        0.12
   
   For sizes larger than 24 inches where an "n" factor other than 0.013 is
used, the minimum grade shall be considered as that which produces a full flow
velocity of not less than 2-1/2 feet per second.
   (d)    Storm sewers installed under or within five feet of pavements and
sidewalks shall be reinforced concrete or high density polyethylene installed
per ODOT 603. One year of natural settlement may be accepted in lieu of
granular material compacted in place if soil conditions appear to be suitable
(subject to Village approval).
   (e)    Storm sewer manholes, or inlets serving as manholes, shall be spaced
a intervals of 400 feet or less for pipe less than twenty-four (24) inches, and
at all grade, alignment and pipe size changes. Manholes shall conform to ODOT
Item 604 and be designed per ODOT standards Construction Drawing MH-3. Layed up
manholes may be permitted providing they are specified at the time of
improvement plan submission, constructed in accordance with ODOT Standard
Construction Drawing MH-1 and are plastered with cement mortar both inside and
out to ensure water tightness. Manhole castings located in asphalt pavement
shall be set in a minimum twelve (12) inch wide concrete collar with a
thickness equal to the pavement section and finished one quarter (1/4) inch
below the pavement surface. The concrete/asphalt interface shall be sealed with
liquid asphalt cement.
   (f)    Storm sewer inlets shall be designed and constructed in conformance
with ODOT Item 604 and ODOT Standard Construction Drawings for CB2-2-A and B;
CB 2-3 and 2-4; CB2-5 and 2-6; and CB-3 and 3A. Inlet CB-3 or CB-3A shall be
used with curbing wherever possible and shall be fitted with vee type grates.
Inlets shall be designed to accept no less than one and one-half (1-1/2) cubic
feet of storm water per second. Inlet time shall be computed based upon Table
2. Layed up catch basins may be permitted providing they are specified at the
time of improvement plan submission, constructed in accordance with the time
appropriate ODOT Standard Construction Drawing and are plastered with cement
mortar both inside and out to ensure tightness. When inlets are located in
asphalt pavement, the concrete/asphalt interface shall be sealed with liquid
asphalt cement.
TABLE 2
MAXIMUM INLET TIMES
   Inlet time shall be computed by the design engineer. However, the maximum
inlet time shall be as follows:
 
 
Distance of Travel to Inlet (Feet) Inlet Time
                                   (Minutes)
100                                12
200                                16
300                                30
 
   (g)    The allowable velocity in open drainage channels shall not exceed the
values shown below in Table 3 for the various soil types and flexible linings.
If the calculated velocity exceeds the shown, a gabion lining or other
satisfactory treatment shall be required.

   (h)    In designing the storm system, the developer shall use the methods
described in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release Number 55,
by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States of
Department of Agriculture and its Ohio Supplement to determine storm water
runoff. The rational method shall only be used for very small areas with prior
approval of the Village. When determining runoff from upstream areas, the
developer shall use the most recent Land Use Development Plan in conjunction
with topographic and other available sources of information.
   (i)    Storm water runoff control involves both peak and total volume of
runoff.
      (1)    The peak rate of runoff from an area after development shall not
exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area before development for all
storms up to a 200-year frequency, 24-hour storm. In addition, if it is found a
proposed development will increase the volume of runoff from an area, the peak
rate of runoff from certain more frequent storms must be controlled further.
The permissible peak rate shall be determined as follows:
         (A)    Determine the total volume of runoff from a 1-year frequency,
24- hour storm occurring over the area to be developed before and after
development.
         (B)    Determine the percent of increase in volume due to development
and; using this percentage, pick the critical storm from the following Table 4:
TABLE 4
CRITICAL STORMS
If the percentage of increase
in volume of runoff is:       The critical storm
Equal to or   and             for discharge limitation
greater than: less than:      will be:

--            10              1 Year
10            20              2 Years
20            50              5 Years
50            100             10 Years
100           250             25 Years
250           500             50 Years
500           --              100 Years
 
      (2)    The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm occurring over the
development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from a one-year frequency
storm occurring over the same area under predevelopment conditions. Storms of
less frequent occurrence (longer return period) than the critical storm shall
have peak rate of runoff not greater than for the same storm under
predevelopment conditions.
      (3)    Storage volume does not have to be provided for off-site upstream
areas. Flow from such areas will be routed through the drainage system in the
development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the
on-site system. Off-site land uses averaged over the last five preceding years
before the development shall be considered as the predevelopment condition for
the purpose of calculating changes in runoff. The required detention shall be
determined using the TR-55 methodology.
         (A)    The subdivider shall obtain Village approval of his detention
facilities and outlot control devices prior to final plat approval.
         (B)    All detention facilities shall be graded and seeded, and easily
maintained.
         (C)    All open detention facilities designed to hold water for more
than twenty-four (24) hours and having side slopes steeper than one (1) to four
(4) shall be fenced with a six (6) foot chain link fence set back ten (10) feet
from the top of the bank and have a twelve (12) foot wide lockable gate for
maintenance access.
            (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96)
1228.05 PAVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS FOR STREETS.
   Other than the following minimum standards the base and surface courses of
streets shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth in
the current edition of Construction and Material Specification of the Ohio
Department of Transportation.
   (a)    State and U.S. highways shall be subject only to State and Federal
construction standards.
   (b)    Major streets and minor streets shall be constructed in accordance
with one of the following alternatives:
      (1)    Eight-inch aggregate base, bituminous prime coat, and two and one-
half inch asphalt concrete surface in accordance with State Department of
Transportation specifications.
      (2)    Other specifications as may be approved by the Planning
Commission, but only if the proposed construction is equivalent to or better
than the above.
         (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.06 MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTHS.
   Minimum pavement widths between curbs or edges of pavement shall be as
follows:
   (a)    Minor streets, twenty-six feet. These are most streets in residential
developments where lots of less than one-half acre exist and where conditions
are such as to discourage high speeds, non-local traffic and heavy street
parking. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, wider minor streets
are needed to accommodate traffic and parking, the width requirement may be
increased.
   (b)    Major streets, thirty-two feet. These include minor streets which, in
the opinion of the Planning Commission, will involve sufficient traffic and/or
parking to justify such width.
   When the nature of the street demands it, pavement widths larger than the
above minimums may be required by the Planning Commission. Commercial and
industrial streets will often require wider pavement width.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.07 CURBS.
   The subdivider shall provide standard six-inch by eighteen-inch concrete
curbs. Curbs shall be constructed in conformance with the current edition of
Construction and Material Specifications of the Ohio Department of
Transportation, as they pertain to this type of improvement. Curbs of different
construction than those specified may be permitted upon approval of the
Planning Commission if the curbs proposed meet equivalent standards of those
specified above.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.08 SIDEWALKS.
   For the safety of pedestrians and of children at play, installation by the
developer of sidewalks on both sides of major streets and other streets with
heavy traffic will normally be required. The Planning Commission shall waive
the requirement of sidewalks for minor streets, or where a park, railroad or
other use on one side of a street makes a sidewalk nonessential.
   Sidewalks, when required, shall be located not less than one foot from the
property line to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges
or other planting or structures placed on the property line at a later date.
When required in a single-family residential area, concrete sidewalks shall be
four feet wide and four inches thick. In multifamily or group housing
developments, sidewalks shall be five feet wide and ten feet wide in commercial
areas.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.09 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR SIDEWALKS.
   Construction standards and specifications for sidewalks shall be the same as
provided for in Section
1014.02 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 06-2007. Passed 2-19-07.)
1228.10 WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.
   Where the public water supply is reasonably accessible and available to the
proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall construct a complete water
distribution system which shall adequately serve all lots and which shall
include appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and this system shall be properly
connected with the public water supply. Where a public water supply is not
within a reasonable distance or otherwise available, the subdivider shall
normally be required to construct a similar water distribution system and
connect it with an alternative supply approved by the County or Ohio Department
of Health or Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. If the County Board of
Health approves the use of individual wells, lot sizes shall meet the approval
of the County Board of Health.
   All water mains, when and if constructed, shall be at least six inches in
diameter, unless the Fire Chief and the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs
have certified that larger mains are required or that smaller mains are
adequate for fire protection and future extensions. All provisions of Chapter
1032 (Water) of these Codified Ordinances shall be adhered to.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.11 SANITARY SEWERS.
   Where the public sanitary sewer system is reasonably accessible and
available to the proposed subdivision the subdivider shall construct a
subdivision sewer system to adequately serve all lots and connect the
subdivision system to the existing system. Where lots cannot be served by the
extension of an existing sanitary sewer, the subdivider shall do one of the
following:
   (a)    Obtain approval of lot sizes for individual sewage disposal systems
and fields from the County Board of Health and other agencies as required by
law.
   (b)    Obtain approval and assure construction of a group or central sewage
disposal system in accordance with State law and all rules and regulations of
the County Health Department and the State of Ohio Health Department or the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   All provisions of Chapter
1024 (Extension of Sanitary Sewers) of these Codified Ordinances shall be
adhered to.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.12 GAS AND ELECTRIC SPECIFICATIONS.
   Gas and electric lines, when and if constructed, shall be in conformity with
the rules and regulations of the servicing company and shall conform to
specifications approved by the servicing company, except as may be regulated by
other provisions of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.13 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be placed at all intersections.
(Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.14 TREES.
   Trees shall be permitted to be planted in the street right of way, but only
with the prior approval of the Village Tree Commission.
(Ord. 51-90. Passed 6-4-90; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.15 GUARANTEES OR COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission until
one of the following alternatives has been achieved:
   (a)    All improvements listed on the plat have been constructed in a
satisfactory manner and approved as follows:
      (1)    Sanitary sewer extensions and water systems have been approved by
the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs.
      (2)    All other improvements, including monuments, storm drainage,
street paving, curbs and gutters, sidewalks and street name signs, have been
approved by the Planning Commission's authorized representative.
   (b)    Security bonds or certified checks have been accepted by the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Sanitary sewer extensions and water systems have been bonded in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1024 (Extensions of Sanitary Sewers) and Chapter
1032 (Water) of these Codified Ordinances.
      (2)    Grading, storm drainage, street paving, curbs and gutters,
sidewalks, street name signs and any other required improvements have been
assured by a security bond or certified check accepted by the Village and made
payable to the Village in an amount at least equal to the estimated cost,
subject to approval of the Planning Commission's authorized representative,
whereby such improvements may be completed without cost to the Village in the
event of default of the subdivider. The bond or check shall be subject to the
condition that the improvements will be completed within one year after
approval unless an extension is granted by the Planning Commission.
         (Ord. 1433. Passed 2-2-76; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1228.16 INSTALLATION OF UTILITIES.
   Utilities, including, but not necessarily limited to, gas, water, sewage,
overhead electric power, telephone, and cable TV facilities, shall be provided
in the street right of way in the grass plot area, except that underground
residential electrical systems may be on private rights of way. When desirable,
utilities may be installed in rear lot easements.
   Before any pavement base is applied, all grading must be completed and
approved by the Planning Commission's authorized representative, and all of the
in-street underground work, such as water mains, gas mains, etc., and all
service connections, shall be completely installed and approved by the
authorized representative throughout the length of the street and across the
flat section. The subdivider shall install all laterals to the lot line prior
to construction of the street.

Code.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 4-4-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1244.05 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)    Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement of this Zoning
Code.
   There shall be a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for any appeal of actions by
the Zoning Inspector. If such appeal is won by the applicant, the fee for the
required zoning permit which must be obtained after winning any appeal shall be
waived, and the zoning permit shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm or
corporation, or by any officer or board of the Village, deeming himself,
herself or itself to be adversely affected by a decision of the Zoning
Inspector respecting the interpretation of this Zoning Code. Appeals shall be
made no later than thirty calendar days after the date of the grievance.
   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Inspector whose decision is appealed from shall certify
to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed, that
by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause "imminent" peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals or by a court having lawful jurisdiction.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a decision on the appeals within ten
days after the public hearing, unless additional time is necessary because of
unusual circumstances. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by
attorney.
   (b)    Variances. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this Zoning Code, the
Board of Appeals shall have the power in passing an appeal to vary or modify
any of the provisions of this Zoning Code, except granting uses or structures
which are not permitted or conditionally permitted in the district in question,
so that the spirit of this Zoning Code shall be observed, public safety
secured, and substantial justice done.
   In every instance of granting a variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals,
there must be a showing by the Board that one of the following applies:
      (1)    The strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would
result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the
general purpose and the intent of this Zoning Code.
      (2)    There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property that do not apply generally to other properties or
uses in the same zoning district or neighborhood.
      (3)    The granting of such variance will not be substantial detriment to
the public interest or to the property or improvements in the district in which
the variance is sought, and will not materially impair the purpose or intent of
this Zoning Code.
   In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit such modification of the
yard or lot area or width regulation as may be necessary to secure the
appropriate improvement or a parcel of land that is too small to be
appropriately improved without such modification, provided the parcel was
separately owned at the time of passage of this Zoning Code or is adjacent to
buildings that do not conform to the general restrictions applicable to their
location.
   In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such
conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, or
welfare and to further the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code. These
conditions shall be made a part of and attached to the required zoning permit.
   The fee for a variance shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which shall be paid
at the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be
obtained after approval of any variance shall be waived, and the zoning permit
issued by the Zoning Inspector.
   (c)    Conditional Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and
determine all conditional uses that are specifically listed within the various
districts. Conditional uses, although often desirable, will more intensely
affect the surrounding area in which they are located than the permitted uses
of such districts. Since this is the case the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
approve an application for a conditional use only when the following conditions
are met:
      (1)    The conditional use is specifically listed or interpreted as
listed in the district in question.
      (2)    The conditional use is in general accord with any adopted Village
plans.
      (3)    The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing land
use character and physical development potential of the area and will not have
undesirable effects on the surrounding area.
   In granting a conditional use the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such
conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, or
welfare and to further the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
   The fee for a conditional use shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which shall
be paid at the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be
obtained after approval of any conditional use shall be waived, and the zoning
permit issued by the Zoning Inspector.
   (d)    Exceptions. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to
grant exceptions. An exception is a use permitted only after review of an
application by the Board of Zoning Appeals, such review being necessary because
the provisions of this Zoning Code covering conditions, precedent or
subsequent, are not precise enough or are too general to cover all applications
without interpretation of the Board of Zoning Appeals. In granting an
exception, the Board may impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to
protect the public health, safety, or welfare and to further the purpose and
intent of this Zoning Code. The Board shall not, however, have the right to
change the intent of this Zoning Code by permitting any use that cannot be
reasonably interpreted as intended in the district in question.
   The fee for an exception shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which shall be
paid at the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be
obtained after approval of any exception shall be waived, and the zoning permit
issued by the Zoning Inspector.
   (e)    Interpretation of Zoning Map. Where the street or lot layout actually
on the ground, or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown
on the Zoning Map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property, shall
interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Code. No fee shall be charged for an interpretation of the Zoning Map.
   (f)    Nonconforming Uses. The Board shall have the power to permit changes
and extensions of nonconforming uses as follows:
      (1)    A nonconforming use of a less objectionable nature may be
substituted for an existing nonconforming use.
      (2)    An existing, legal nonconforming use which occupies only a portion
of an existing structure or premises may be extended throughout such structure
or premises.
      (3)    The alteration or reconstruction of a nonconforming use or
building may be permitted, provided that such will make the nonconforming use
substantially more in character with its surroundings.
      (4)    The extension of a nonconforming use may be permitted when such
extension will substantially make the nonconforming use more in character with
its surroundings. Such extensions shall not be greater than fifty percent of
the size of the nonconforming use that existed at the time of passage of this
Zoning Code.
   The Board may impose such requirements and conditions as it may deem
necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interests.
The fee for a nonconforming use change shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which
shall be paid at the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which
must be obtained after approval of any nonconforming use change shall be
waived, and the zoning permit issued by the Zoning Inspector.
   (g)    Temporary Uses. The temporary use of a building or premises, such as
a house trailer or construction office, in any district for a purpose or use
that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this Zoning Code for the
district in which it is located, may be granted when determined justifiable by
the Board of Zoning Appeals. Portable toilets for construction and other such
small structures shall not require a temporary use approval by the board.
   Such temporary use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable
permit for not more than a twelve-month period, subject to such conditions as
will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.
   The fee for a temporary use shall be twenty dollars ($20.00), which shall be
paid at the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be
obtained after approval of any temporary use shall be waived, and the zoning
permit issued by the Zoning Inspector.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 4-4-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1244.06 PROCEDURE FOR ACTIONS.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall act according to the procedure
specified by law, including this Zoning Code.
   (b)    The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote for
each member on all questions, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such
fact.
   (c)    All applications for appeals, variances, conditional uses,
exceptions, nonconforming uses, and temporary uses shall be made to the Board
of Zoning Appeals in writing and on any forms prescribed therefor. All
applications shall set forth the reason the appeal, variance, conditional use,
exception, nonconforming use, or temporary use should be granted.
   (d)    Every decision of the Board shall be by resolution, each of which
shall contain a full record of the findings of the Board of Zoning Appeals,
together with all documents pertaining thereto, and shall be a public record.
   (e)    Fees, as prescribed in this Zoning Code, shall be paid in full prior
to any action by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (f)   In the event that the Board of Zoning Appeals will find it necessary
to draw upon any planning, legal, engineering, or any other expert testimony,
such services and the fees therefor may be required of the applicant as a part
of the application.
   (g)    No action shall be taken on any request for any appeal, variance,
conditional use, exception, or nonconforming use, prior to a public hearing.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 4-4-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1244.07 NOTICE OF HEARINGS.
   (a)    When a notice of appeal, variance, conditional use, exception, or
nonconforming use has been filed in proper form with the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the Secretary or other designated person shall immediately place the
request for the same upon the calendar for hearing, and shall state on the
notices the time, place and object of the hearing, which notices shall be
served personally or by mail, addressed to the parties making the request, at
least five days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. Public hearings are
not required, but may be held if determined necessary by the Board, for
temporary uses and interpretations of the Zoning Map.
   (b)    Written notice of such hearings shall also be given by mail or served
personally to the owners of property within and contiguous to and directly
across the street from the land to which such appeal, variance, conditional
use, exception, nonconforming use, temporary use, or interpretation of the
Zoning Map is related.
   (c)    All notices shall be sent to addresses given on the last tax
assessment roll or other legally designated address list.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 4-4-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)

(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code as amended from time to time,
shall be exempt from all fees set forth in this chapter. Determination of non-
profit status shall be made by the Board of Zoning Appeals. For the purposes of
this section, a Determination Letter from the Internal Revenue Service shall be
sufficient evidence of non-profit status. In the case of churches or other
organizations qualifying as a non-profit organization under Section 501(c)(3),
but which do not have a Determination Letter, non-profit status will be
determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals based on the facts and circumstances.

                                        zero lot line).
                                        For medium density single-family

R-3 Urban Residential                   generally the older portions of the
                                        Village. Some limited apartment

                                        line. These are generally in the older
                                        portions of the Village.

1250.01 YARD, AREA, AND HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS FOR DWELLINGS.
   Table I, following the text of this chapter, establishes the minimum yard,
area, and height requirements for dwellings and structures accessory to
dwellings by district.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 44-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1250.02 YARD, AREA, HEIGHT, AND LOT COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL BUILDINGS
OTHER THAN DWELLINGS.
   Table II, following the text of this chapter, establishes the yard, area,
lot coverage, and height requirements for all buildings except dwellings and
structures accessory to dwellings by district.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 44-83.)
   Table III, following the text of this chapter, establishes the maximum
density of dwelling units which may be situated on lots. (Ord. 75-96. Passed
11-18-96)
1250.03 EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Any lot of record existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code and
held in separate ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots may
be used for the erection of permitted and conditional uses even though its area
and width are less than the minimum requirements of this Zoning Code, but only
to the extent granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 44-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1250.04 LOT REVIEW BY VILLAGE HEALTH AGENCY.
   Prior to issuance of any zoning permit for any residential, commercial,
industrial, public, or semi-public structure, when central water and/or sewage
disposal facilities are not available or not used, the Village Health Agency
shall be requested to establish the minimum lot area for any permitted or
conditional uses in all districts, but in no case shall the lot area be less
than that specified in Table I or Table II for the various districts.
   If, in the opinion of the Village Health Agency, the development of any such
lot or lots, regardless of size, would lead to the creation of a serious health
threat, then all zoning permits for such lot or lots shall be withheld and
development not permitted until and unless an agreement for appropriate health
safeguards can be reached between the owner or his or her agent, the Village
Council, and the Village Health Agency.
(Ord. 19-83. Passed 4-4-83; Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1250.05 APPLICATION OF YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Lots which abut on more than one street shall provide the required
front yards along every street.
   (b)    Structures and accessory structures, whether open or closed, such as
garages, carports, porches, balconies, or platforms above grade level, shall be
considered a part of the structure to which they are attached and shall not
project into any required front, side or rear yards except as permitted in this
Zoning Code.
   (c)    When the rear lot line is adjacent to any alley, garages and other
accessory structures may be constructed in the required rear yard but shall not
be closer than five feet from the side lot line without the written permission
of the neighborhood property owner.
   (d)    Yard requirements shall not apply to steps, overhanging eaves, and
cornices. However, these portions of buildings shall not project over any
property line or street right of way.

1252.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Loudonville, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Loudonville has special flood hazard areas that are subject
to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted. (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (3)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (4)   Base (l00-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (5)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (6)   Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (7)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths 1
to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by the a Federal Flood protection system under construction;
no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus zero feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Loudonville's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries. .
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal Government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal Government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Loudonville
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 1, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General’s Department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is :
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.04 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near floodprone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.06 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
    These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Loudonville as identified in Section
1252.07, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Village of Loudonville. (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are

reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Hall at 156 North Water Street, Loudonville,
Ohio.
      (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.08 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including Subdivision Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations. (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09/)
1252.09 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Loudonville, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.11 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)

of the Clean Water Act.
   (b)   Approval. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
(Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.17 INSPECTIONS.
   The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic inspections at appropriate
times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance with
permit conditions.
(Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.18 POST-CONSTRUCTION CERTIFICATIONS REQUIRED.

Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damage structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood

applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1252.21 (a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Loudonville and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but no
Floodways.  
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1252.33(a)(2), items A. and C. - E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Loudonville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1252.21 (a)(1)C., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file, within 30
days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action, a brief
statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any item
appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted. (Ord. 47-
2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.37  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances Shall Only Be Issued Upon:  
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less is
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1252.37 (b)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 47-2009. Passed 7-6-09.)
1252.38 PROCEDURES AT HEARINGS.

required to replace existing tanks with those constructed as per the
specifications above, and not exceeding the capacity of existing tanks, at the
time of existing tank replacement or upgrade.
   (d)    No substitutions of a nonconforming use shall be permitted which
results in an increase of the Hazardous Potential Ranking System on a parcel
within this district. If the Hazard Potential Ranking decreases for a
nonconforming use for a period of twelve months or more, the nonconforming
right to the higher Hazardous Potential Ranking shall be deemed to have been
lost through non-use for that period of time. (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)

1257.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Architectural Review District is to recognize, preserve,
and enhance the historic character of the downtown area of Loudonville, Ohio,
by safeguarding the architectural integrity of historic structures. This
district is also established to discourage new construction or alterations of
existing buildings that are determined to be detrimental to, and incompatible
with, the existing architecture, physical form and historic atmosphere of the
downtown area of Loudonville. It is also recognized that beyond cultural
benefits, the protection of historical resources in the Village will further
the economic development of the area and will help maintain and improve area
property values. The ARD District is an overlay zoning district that imposes
development standards in addition to the standards contained in the underlying
district.
(Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.02 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   A Certificate of Appropriateness is required prior to:
   (a)    Any new construction of a structure.
   (b)    Any remodeling which involves the alteration of a foundation,
alteration of a roof line, the enclosure of any porch, deck or breezeway, or
the replacement of windows, or siding.
   (c)    The placement, replacement, or re-construction of any sign.
   (d)    The demolition of any structure, except when a structure is declared
unsafe and is an imminent peril.
   (e)    Exterior painting when colors are changed.
      (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   There is hereby established a Design Review Board that shall have the
authority to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness to those persons who, upon
proper application, desire to make any changes other than ordinary maintenance
to any structure, objects or property, real or otherwise, within the
Architectural Review District.
   The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness within the District is
required before the issuance of a zoning permit by the Village Codes
Enforcement Officer.
(Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.04 COMPOSITION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   The Design Review Board shall be composed of five (5) members, all citizens
of the Village, appointed by the Mayor. Three (3) members shall constitute a
quorum, and a simple majority vote of all the Board (three members) shall be
necessary to pass any motion. The Board shall meet as needed. In case of a tie
vote, the Codes Enforcement Officer shall be called upon to cast a deciding
vote. Members terms shall be for five (5) years with each term staggered. The
chairman shall be appointed by the Mayor. (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.05 DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   The Design Review Board shall have the following duties:
   (a)    The Board may conduct surveys or otherwise assemble information
related to all areas, places, buildings, structures, homes, works of art, or
other objects of environmental, architectural and aesthetic interest in the
Village.
   (b)    The Board shall work for the continuing education of the residents of
the Village with respect to the architectural and historic heritage of the
Village.
   (c)    The Board is hereby authorized to issue, upon compliance with these
regulations, a certificate of appropriateness upon application. When a
certificate of appropriateness is granted, it shall be directed to the Codes
Enforcement Officer who may issue a zoning permit provided all other sections
of this Code are complied with. The certificate of appropriateness shall
precede the issuance of a zoning permit.
      (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.06 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW CRITERIA.
   In the review of applications for a certificate of appropriateness and other
matters, the Board shall be guided by the following requirements and criteria:
   (a)    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure or site and their environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided when feasible.
   (b)    All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (c)    If changes to a building that have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site
and its environment, and these changes are deemed to have acquired
significance, then this significance (if any) shall be recognized and
respected.
   (d)    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (e)    Significant architectural features that have deteriorated shall be
repaired, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in design, color, texture and
other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of architectural features should
be based on accurate
duplications of features, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical
or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural, designed or the availability
of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (f)    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage historic building materials should be
avoided.
   (g)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or next to any project.
   (h)    Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy historical, architectural or cultural material and such design is
compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property,
neighborhood or environment.
   (i)    Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original
structure would be unimpaired.
   (j)    The Design Review Board may require applicants to explore
alternatives to demolition of a building or structure.
   (k)    The design of new structures and of additions to existing structures,
including new site improvements, shall take into account the architectural
style, general design, arrangement, texture, material, and color of other
structures and premises within the Architectural Review District.
   (l)    All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures shall use natural traditional exterior materials such as brick,
stone, masonry and wood, where possible.
   (m)    Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that are both
identified with the origin or the era in which the area was originally built,
should be used for building exteriors for all new construction.
   (n)    All signs shall be of such a style or design that is reflected in the
district, and shall conform to the requirements of Chapter
1258. Sign size and shape shall also respond to the existing proportions of
period structures, and signs shall not be permitted to cover or otherwise hid
important architectural features.
        (Ord. 75-96. Passed 11-18-96.)
1257.07 PROCEDURES.
   Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness, as adopted by the Design
Review Board, shall be filed with the Codes Enforcement Officer, and the Design
Review Board shall meet within ten (10) business days following the submission
of a complete application. In addition to an application form, the Design
Review Board shall specify the type of drawings, materials, sketches and
material samples that are required and which must accompany or supplement an

approaches in repair and in working condition, following written notification,
the repair may be undertaken by Village forces. The cost so incurred by the
Village may be assessed to the property owner.
      (10)   State highway permits are issued by the Ohio Department of
Transportation. County road permits are issued by the counties. Township road
permits are issued by the townships.

development of storage warehouses in C-1, C-2 and R-C Districts for uses
accessory to residential uses in a planned manner in harmony with the
neighborhood in which warehouse development is undertaken. Such use shall be a
conditional use and not a use of right.

of this section, no storage warehouse shall be permitted in any district or
territory zoned R-1, R-2, R-2a, R-3 or R-4.
   (c)   Not to Restrict Use by Right. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit
warehouse use within an Industrial District as elsewhere permitted or provided
for by section.
   (d)   Conditional Use Required. The Village Council may, after the review

Affairs and the Fire Department to determine whether such site plan complies
with the terms and conditions set forth herein.
      (2)   After Planning Commission review, said plan shall be forwarded to
the Village Council for review and recommendation. The Council shall then
proceed to review said application upon the recommendation of the Loudonville
Planning Commission. No plan shall be approved that does not comply with the
provisions set forth herein.
      (3)   Prior to review by the Commission and the Council, notice shall be
published as for a zoning amendment pursuant to the procedure set forth in
Section
1240.05 .
      (4)   The application for such a plan shall be subject to the same
protest rights provided to property owners.
      (5)   An approved plan for a storage warehouse shall be and remain valid
for a period of twenty-four months from the date of its approval, after which
said plan may be declared void by the Council. In the case of a plan for phased
development, any portion of the plan upon which construction is not begun
within twenty-four months of approval may be declared void by the Council.
   (f)   Contents of Plan and Site Review; General Requirements.
      (1)    No storage warehouse facility shall exceed the lot coverage
percentages established and defined by this Zoning Codes and/or the Subdivision
Regulations of the Village of Loudonville, Ohio, as said Code and Regulations

a maximum height of ten feet.
   (g)    On-Site Manager Required. No facility herein provided for shall be
used or maintained unless or until an on-site manager shall be provided for at
such facility. Failure to provide such a manager shall be grounds for
revocation of the conditional use. Upon application to Council, however,
Council may waive this requirement upon a showing of good cause.
   (h)    Commercial Activity Prohibited. The sale of any item from or at a
residential storage warehouse is specifically prohibited.

license or occupancy permit, or to take any other appropriate legal or
administrative action necessary to halt or prohibit any commercial activity
from any storage warehouse other than the leasing of storage units.
   (i)    Repair of Autos, Boats, Motors, and Furniture Prohibited. Because of
the danger from fire or explosion caused by the accumulation of vapors from
gasoline, diesel fuel, paint, paint remover and other flammable materials, the
repair, construction or reconstruction of any boat, engine, motor vehicle or
furniture and the storage of any propane or gasoline engine or propane or
gasoline storage tank or any boat or vehicle incorporating such components is
prohibited within any structure authorized and constructed pursuant to this
section, except as otherwise provided for herein, provided, however, that a
boat or motor vehicle may be stored in areas for which proper and adequate
ventilation is provided.
   (j)    Storage Warehouse Defined. For purposes of this section, a storage
warehouse is hereby defined to be any building or structure used for storage
purposes by any individual other than the owner, resident, or business occupant
of the premises on which said storage building, structure or facility is
located, and shall specifically include any building, structures or facility
used for storage purposes in whole or in part, whereby such building, structure
or facility is leased or rented to a tenant or lessee other than the owner of
the building, structure or facility, or other than an individual occupying the
real estate primarily for residential purposes, whereby the use of the
building, structure or facility is leased for storage purposes incident to the
