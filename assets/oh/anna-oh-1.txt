the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last

§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.

privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by

as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is

(R.C. § 1.54) (Rev. 2002)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.

sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.

changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the legislative
authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the legislative authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language should be used by the municipality to amend,

the unmarked police vehicle will pull off and act as a back-up vehicle upon the
stop of the suspect vehicle.
         (b)   There should only be one marked police vehicle in immediate
pursuit with a back-up vehicle to assist. All other vehicles shall maintain a
perimeter control unless otherwise instructed.
         (c)   At no time will an officer the Anna Police Department be

there is a pursuit in progress and provide necessary information.
         (g)   The dispatcher will also contact the supervisor and keep him or
her informed.
      (6)   Supervisors.
         (a)   Supervisors involved in pursuit situations should assume a back-
up position unless they are the primary pursuing officer. The supervisor’s roll
shall be to direct and control the pursuit through communications.

identifying the fleeing vehicle, tactics to stop the fleeing vehicle, and
coordination of all officers involved in the pursuit.
         (c)   A supervisor or the primary pursuing officer should never
hesitate to order the termination of a pursuit when conditions warrant.
         (d)   All pursuits will be terminated when it becomes an extreme
danger to the public, the involved officer, and the suspect/violator.
         (e)   The condition of the pursuing vehicle, road and weather

if conditions permit.
         (f)   Use of a spotlight focused in the rear window may be of
assistance in stopping the suspect vehicle.

to the officer or other persons; or

from the agency who initiated the pursuit or the supervisor from another agency
who has been given control of the pursuit by his or her initiating agency.
         (d)   The design of the roadblock shall be in a manner as to leave an
open path through the restricted area. This path should be designed so that the
officer/violator could proceed through it at a slower rate of speed.

a stationary roadblock.
      (10)   Firing upon a moving vehicle.

vehicle; however, if fired upon, officers may return fire when appropriate.

§ 35.03 IMPOSITION OF THE TAX.
   (A)   The one percent tax.
      (1)   Basis.

            1.   In the case of residents of the Village of Anna, an annual tax
of 1% is imposed on all salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned during the effective period of these regulations. For the
purpose of determining the tax on the earnings of resident taxpayers taxed
under §
35.03, the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which the
services were rendered, are immaterial. All the earnings wherever earned or
paid are taxable.
            2.   The following are items which are subject to the tax imposed
by §
35.01(A)(1)(a) of these regulations.
               a.   On all qualifying wages as defined in IRC § 3121(a).
               b.   On the gross wages of those employees exempt from the

               c.   Payments made to employees by an employer as vacation wages
are taxable.
               d.   Payments made to an employee by an employer, or a third
party provider on behalf of the employer, under a wage continuation plan during
periods of disability or sickness, are taxable.
               e.   Where compensation is paid or received in property, its
fair market value, at the time of receipt, shall be subject to the tax and to
withholding. Board, lodging, and similar items received by an employee in lieu
of additional cash compensation shall be included in earnings at their fair
market value. In the case of domestics and other employees whose duties require
them to live at their place of employment or assignment, board and lodging
shall not be considered as wages or compensation earned.
         (b)   Non-resident employee.
            1.   In the case of individuals who are not residents of the
Village of Anna, there is imposed under this division of these regulations, a
tax of 1% on all salaries, qualifying wages, and commissions, and other
compensation earned during the effective period of these regulations for work
done or services performed or rendered within the Village of Anna, whether the
compensation or remuneration is received or earned directly or through an
agent, and whether paid in cash or in property. The location of the place from
which payment is made is immaterial. A non-resident employee who performs
services inside the village on 13 or more days or occasions, whichever
represents the shorter time period, is taxable under these regulations.
            2.   The items subject to tax under this division of these
regulations are the same as those listed and defined in §
35.03(A)(1)(a). For the methods of computing the extent of the work or services
performed within the Village of Anna, in cases involving compensation for
personal services partly within and partly without the Village of Anna, see §
35.06(A)(6).
         (c)   1.   Imposition of tax on net profits of resident businesses.
               a.   In the case of resident businesses, professions,
enterprises, undertakings, or other entities conducted, operated, engaged in,
prosecuted or carried on, irrespective of whether the taxpayer has an office or
place of business in the Village of Anna, there is imposed an annual tax of 1%
on the adjusted federal taxable income earned, accrued, or received during the
effective period of these regulations attributable to the Village of Anna,
under the formula or separate accounting method provided for in §
35.03 of these regulations, derived from sales made, work done, or services
performed or rendered, and business or other activities conducted in the
Village of Anna.
               b.   An unincorporated association, partnership, limited
partnership or limited liability company, (also known as a pass-through
entity), which is domiciled in the village may make an election as to whether
the income of the entity shall be taxed at the entity level (i.e. in the hands
of the entity) or in the hands of the owner or owners of the entity. For
entities in existence on January 1, 2003 the manner in which their past returns
have been filed shall constitute the making of the election for the purposes of
this rule. The tax imposed on an unincorporated resident entity owned by one
person is upon the individual owner.
               c.   The tax imposed by §
35.03(A)(3)(a) of these regulations is imposed on all resident entities having
adjusted federal taxable income attributable to the Village of Anna under the
method of allocation provided for in the regulations, regardless of where the
owner or owners of the resident business entity reside.
               d.   Resident unincorporated entities owned by two or more
persons, all of whom are residents of the Village of Anna, shall disregard the
method of allocation provided for in these regulations and pay the tax on their
entire federal adjusted taxable income thereof. In this case, the tax paid by
the entity shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the
entity for their distributive share of the net profits; however, an additional
return shall be required from any owner or member having taxable income other
than the distributive share of the net profits from the entity.
            2.   Imposition of tax on resident’s distributive share of profits
of a resident business entity, not attributable to the Village of Anna.
               a.   A resident individual who is sole owner of a resident
entity shall disregard the business allocation formula and pay the tax on the
entire net profits of his or her resident business entity.

of a resident entity, there is imposed an annual tax of 1% on the individual’s
distributive share of net profits earned, accrued, or received during the
effective period of the regulations not attributable to the Village of Anna,
under the method of allocation provided for in §
35.01 of these regulations, and not taxed against the entity. (See §
35.15).

businesses. See §
35.15  for credits.

enterprises, undertakings, or other activities conducted, operated, engaged in,
prosecuted, or carried on, there is imposed an annual tax of 1% on the net
profits earned, accrued, or received during the effective period of these
regulations attributable to the Village of Anna, under the formula or separate
accounting method provided for in this regulation.
               b.   The tax imposed on non-resident entities owned by two or
more persons is upon the entities rather than the individual members or owners
thereof. (For tax on that part of a resident owner’s distributive share of net
profits not taxed against the entity, see §
35.03(A)(4)(b)).
               c.   Non-resident entities owned by two or more persons, all of
whom are residents of the Village of Anna, may elect to disregard the method of
allocation provided for in these regulations and pay the tax on the entire net
profits. In this case, the tax paid by the entity shall constitute all tax due
from the owners or members of the entity for their distributive share of the
net profits; however, a return shall be required from the owner or member
having taxable income other than the distributive share of the net profit from
the entity.
               d.   Distributions of proportionate shares received by an owner
domiciled in the village from any pass-through entity from a non-resident pass-
through entity such as a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company or Subchapter S corporation shall be considered as income from an
association as defined in these regulations. This rule codifies the
interpretation of the regulations as of January 1, 2003. Ref: R.C. § 718.14(B).
            2.   Imposition of tax on resident’s share of profits of a non-
resident business entity not attributable to the Village of Anna. See §
35.15 for credits.
               a.   A resident individual who is sole owner of a non-resident
business entity shall disregard the business allocation formula and pay the tax
on the entire net profits of his or her entity.
               b.   In the case of a resident individual partner or part owner
of a nonresident entity, there is imposed an annual tax of 1% on the
individual’s distributive share of net profits earned, accrued, or received
during the effective period of these regulations not attributable to the
village under the method of allocation provided for in §
35.03 of these regulations and not taxed against the entity.
         (e)   Imposition of tax on the adjusted federal taxable income of
corporations.
            1.   In the case of corporations, whether domestic or foreign and
whether or not the corporations have an office or place of business in the
Village of Anna, there is imposed an annual tax of 1% on the net profits
earned, received, or accrued during the effective period of these regulations
attributable to the Village of Anna under the formula provided for in these
regulations.
            2.   In determining whether a corporation is conducting a business
or other activity in the Village of Anna, the provisions of §
35.03(A)(1)(b) of these regulations shall be applicable.
         (f)   Amplification.
            1.   Amplification. In amplification of the definition contained in
§
35.02 of these regulations, but not in limitation thereof, the following
additional information respecting net business profits is furnished.
            2.   Adjusted federal taxable income.
               a.   Net profits as used in these regulations means the adjusted
federal taxable income derived from any business, profession, or other activity
or undertaking carried on for profit or normally carried on for profit.
               b.   Net profits, as disclosed on any return filed pursuant to
the provisions of these regulations, shall be computed by the same accounting
method used in reporting net income to the Federal Internal Revenue Service
(providing the method does not conflict with any provisions of these
regulations). Net profits, shown on returns filed pursuant to these
regulations, must be reconciled with the income reported to the Federal
Internal Revenue Service.
         (g)   Rental from real property.
            1.   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if
and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management, or operation of the
real estate from which the rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed, or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer, in whole or
in part.
            2.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
            3.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
            4.   Real property, as the term is used in these regulations, shall
include commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and
all other types of real estate.
            5.   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent, and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.
            6.   Residents of the Village of Anna are subject to taxation upon
the net income from rental (to the extent above specified), regardless of the
location of the real property owned.
            7.   Non-residents of the Village of Anna are subject to taxation
only if the real property is situated within the Village of Anna.
            8.   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only
on that portion of income derived from property located in the Village of Anna.
            9.   Losses from rentals located and/or operating outside of the
village and owned by a resident will be allowed to offset other taxable income
in the following manner:
               a.   The loss will be adjusted to reflect an identical negative
effect as if the rental had netted a gain to include all applicable credits for
taxes paid to other cities.
               b.   Losses that occur in another taxing jurisdiction with a
rate of 1% or more are not allowed to offset W-2 income taxable to the Village
of Anna. The loss can not be carried forward to off-set any income other than
the venture which produced the loss.
      (2)   Allocation of business profits. A request to change the method of
allocation must be made in writing before the end of the taxable year.
         (a)   Business allocation percentage method.
            1.   Step l.
               a.   Ascertain the percentage which the actual cost of real and
tangible personal property, including lease-hold improvements, owned or used in
the business and situated within the Village of Anna, is of the average net
book value of all real and tangible personal property, including leasehold
improvements, owned or used in the business wherever situated, during the
period covered by the return.
               b.   The percentage of taxpayer’s real and tangible personal
property within the Village of Anna is determined by dividing the average net
book value of the property within the Village of Anna (without deduction of any
encumbrances) by the average net book value of all property within and without
the Village of Anna. In determining the percentage, property rented to the
taxpayer, as well as real and tangible personal property owned by taxpayer,
must be considered.
                  i.   The actual cost of real and tangible personal property
rented by taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying gross annual rents
payable by eight.
                  ii.   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
                     A.   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real
and tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a
fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales profits or otherwise; and
                     B.   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of
rent such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other amounts required to
be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangements.
            2.   Step 2. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of
the taxpayer derived from sales made and service rendered in the Village of
Anna is of the total gross receipts, wherever derived, during the period
covered by the return.
               a.   The following sales shall be considered the Village of Anna
sales:
                  i.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
Village of Anna to purchasers within or without the Village of Anna, except the
sales to purchasers outside the Village of Anna that are directly attributable
to regular solicitations made outside the Village of Anna personally by
taxpayer’s employees.
                  ii.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Village of Anna if shipped or delivered from an office,
store, warehouse, factory, or place of storage located within the Village of
Anna.
                  iii.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Village of Anna even though transported from a point
outside the Village of Anna if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village of
Anna and the sale is directly or indirectly the result of the solicitation.
                  iv.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory, or place of storage within the Village of
Anna to purchasers outside the Village of Anna if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place of delivery.
                  v.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to
a sale, whether or not included in the price of the property, shall be
considered gross receipts from the sale.
               b.   In the application of the foregoing divisions, a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale; and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial. Solicitation of customers
outside the Village of Anna by mail or phone from an office, or place of
business within the Village of Anna shall not be considered a solicitation of
sales outside the Village of Anna.
            3.   Step 3. Ascertain the percentage which the total wages,
salaries, commissions, and other compensation of employees within the Village
of Anna is of the total qualifying wages, salaries, commissions, and other
compensation of all the taxpayer’s employees within and without the Village of
Anna during the period covered by the return.
               a.   Salaries and reasonable compensation paid owners, or
credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the
return, are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
               b.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be computed
on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used
in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
               c.   In the case of an employee who performs services both
within and without the Village of Anna, the amount treated as compensation for
services performed within the village shall be deemed to be:
                  i.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him or her, such as a salesman on
a commission basis, the amount received by him or her for the business
attributable to his or her efforts within the Village of Anna.
                  ii.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
on other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received
which the value of his or her services within the Village of Anna bears to the
values of all his or her services; and
                  iii.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time
basis, the proportion of the total amount received by him or her, which his or
her working time within the Village of Anna is of his or her total working
time.
            4.   Step 4. Add the percentages determined in accordance with
Steps 1, 2, and 3, or the aforesaid percentages as may be applicable to the
particular taxpayer’s business, and divide the total so obtained by the number
of percentages used in ascertaining the total. The result so obtained is the
business allocation percentage. In determining the average percentage, a factor
shall not be excluded from the computation merely because the factor is found
to be allocable entirely outside the Village of Anna. A factor is excluded only
when it does not exist anywhere.
            5.   Step 5. The business allocation percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits allocable to the Village of Anna.
         (b)   Substitute method.
            1.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained
under the formula, the Board, upon application of the taxpayer or the
Commissioner, may substitute other factors in the formula or prescribe other
methods of allocating net income calculated to effect a fair and proper
allocation.
            2.   Application to the Board to substitute other factors in the
formula or to use a different method to allocate net profits must be made in
writing before the end of the taxable year and shall state the specific grounds
on which the substitution of factors or use of a different method is requested
and the relief sought to be obtained. A copy thereof shall be served at the
time of filing upon the taxpayer or Commissioner as the case may be. No
specific form need be followed in making the application. Once a taxpayer has
filed under a substitute method, he or she must continue to so file until given
permission to change by the Board of Review.
      (3)   Operating loss carry forward.
         (a)   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable
under these regulations sustained in any taxable year subsequent to January 1,
1978, allocable to the Village of Anna, may be applied against the portion of
the profits of succeeding years allocable to the Village of Anna until
exhausted, but in no event of more than five taxable years. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
         (b)   In the event net profits are allocated both within and without
the Village of Anna, the portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be
allocated to the Village of Anna in the same manner as provided herein for
allocating net profits to the Village of Anna. The portion of a net operating
loss to be carried forward shall be determined in the year the net operating
loss is sustained, on the basis of the allocation factors applicable to that
year. The same method of accounting and allocation must be used in the year to
which an operating loss is carried as was used in the year in which the
operating loss was sustained.
         (c)   In the case of fiscal years beginning prior to the effective
date of these regulations, the net operating loss deduction will be that
portion of the operating loss that the number of months of the fiscal year
after the effective date of these regulations bears to the total number of
months in the fiscal year.
         (d)   A short fiscal year (a fiscal year of less than 12 months) in
cases where there has been a change in accounting period, where a new taxpayer
selects a short fiscal year, or where a new taxpayer operates in the Village of
Anna for less than his or her full accounting period, shall be considered as a
full taxable fiscal year.
         (e)   In any return in which a net operating loss deduction is
claimed, a schedule should be attached showing:
            1.   Year in which net operating loss was sustained;
            2.   Method of accounting and allocation, used to determine portion
of net operating loss allocable to the Village of Anna;
            3.   Amount of net operating loss used as a deduction in prior
years; and
            4.   Amount of net operating loss claimed as a deduction in current
year.
         (f)   The net operating loss of a business which loses its identity
through merger, consolidation, and the like, shall not be allowed as a carry-
forward loss deduction to the surviving business entity.
         (g)   Losses occurring in a taxing jurisdiction outside of the Village
of Anna, which imposes a tax of 1% or more can not be carried forward to off-
set income other than the venture that produced the loss by a resident of the
Village of Anna.
      (4)   Consolidated returns. Consolidated returns may be filed by any
affiliated group of corporations if that affiliated group filed for the same
tax reporting period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes
pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Exceptions. The following shall not be considered taxable.
         (a)   Poor relief, unemployment insurance benefits, supplemental
unemployment benefits, old age pensions, or similar payments received from
local, state, or federal governments or charitable or religious organizations.
         (b)   Proceeds of insurance, annuities, workman’s compensation
insurance, social security benefits, pensions, compensation for damages for
personal injuries and like reimbursement, not including damages for loss of
profits.
         (c)   Compensation for damage to property by way of insurance or
otherwise.
         (d)   Interest and dividends from intangible property.
         (e)   Military pay and allowances received as a member of the armed
forces of the United States; to include nonactive duty pay, reserve pay, and
National Guard pay.
         (f)   Any charitable, educational, fraternal, or other type of non-
profit association or organization enumerated in R.C. § 718.01 which is exempt
from payment of real estate taxes is exempt from payment of the tax imposed by
these regulations.
         (g)   Any association or organization falling in the category listed
in the division (f) above not exempt from the payment of real estate taxes is
required to file declarations and final returns and remit the taxes levied
under these regulations on all business activities of a type ordinarily
conducted for profit by taxpayers operating for profit.
         (h)   Where a non-profit association or organization conducts income-
producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it shall
calculate its profits allocable to the Village of Anna under the method or
methods provided above.
         (i)   Ministers’ housing allowance.
         (j)   Pay received for work performed at an election precinct for
amounts less than $1,000 during a calendar year.
         (k)   Nonresident employees who perform services inside the village
for 12 or fewer days, or any part of any day, during any calendar year.
   (B)   The three quarter percent tax.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to authorize, provide for,
and levy an additional tax on income at the rate of 3/4% (additional tax) over
and above the 1% tax on income currently being levied and collected (income
tax), in order to provide funds for the payment of Fire Department improvements
and expenses.
      (2)   Imposition of additional tax. The additional tax for the purpose
specified in division (B)(1) above shall be imposed at the rate of 3/4% per
annum over and above the 1 % tax currently being levied and collected, the
question of levying the additional tax having been approved by the requisite
majority of voters voting thereon in the general election held on November 3,
1998.
      (3)   Levy, collection and payment of additional tax.
         (a)   The additional tax shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to salaries, wages, commissions, rentals and other compensation on and
after January 1, 1999, and with respect to the net profits of businesses,
professions or other activities earned on or after January 1, 1999. Provided,
however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or other
activity differs from the calendar year, the additional tax shall be applied to
that part of the net profits for the fiscal year as shall be earned on or after
January 1, 1999, to the close of the taxpayer’s fiscal year. Thereafter, the
taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis.
         (b)   The funds collected as a direct result and consequence of the
additional tax levied and imposed under the provisions of this division shall
be allocated for the following purposes.
            1.   The funds collected under this division shall be placed into
the Village Income Tax Fund as the funds are collected, and then shall be
transferred to the Village Fire Department Fund in accordance with reports from
the Tax Commissioner which specify the amount of funds which have been
collected as a direct result and consequence of the additional tax levied and
imposed under this division.
            2.   The funds collected under this division shall be allocated
first to defray all costs and expenses of collecting the additional tax levied
and imposed by this division and second for the purpose of payment of Fire
Department improvements and expenses.
      (4)   Income tax credit. Resident individuals of the Village of Anna who
are required to pay and do pay tax to a municipality other than the village on
salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation for work done or services
performed outside the village or new profits from business, professions or
other activities conducted outside the village may claim a credit of the amount
of the tax paid by them on their behalf to another municipality to the extent
of the additional tax imposed by this division on the income, the credit being
limited to 3/4% of the amount of income tax by both the village and another
municipality. A return must be filed for the purpose of claiming the credit or
allowance, together with the evidence of the payment of similar tax to the
municipality in which the resident has a source of income as the Tax
Commissioner may require.
      (5)   Levy and collection. The 3/4 % annual tax for the purposes
specified in this division, shall be levied and collected in the manner as set
forth in this section, and not levied on the items set forth in §
35.03(A)(5) of the regulations.

§ 35.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Date and requirement for filing.
      (1)   On or before April fifteenth of the year following the effective
date of the regulations and each year thereafter, every person subject to the
provisions of §
35.03(A)(1)(a), inclusive, of the regulations shall, except as hereinafter
provided, make and file with the Commissioner, a return on a form prescribed by
and obtainable upon request from the Commissioner, or a generic form which must
contain all of the information requested on the tax form as provided by the Tax
Commissioner, whether or not a tax be due.
      (2)   If the return is made for a fiscal year or any period less than a
year, the return shall be made within 3-1/2 months from the end of each fiscal
year or other period.
      (3)   Every person subject to the provisions of §
35.03 of the regulations shall, except as hereinafter provided, file a return
setting forth the aggregate amount of salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other personal service compensation, net profits from business or other
activities, including the rental from use of real and personal property, and
other income, taxable under the regulations, received for the period covered by
the return and any other pertinent facts and information in detail as the
Commissioner may require.
      (4)   Where an employee’s entire earnings for the tax period as paid by a
resident employer or resident employers, and the 1% tax and additional 3/4% tax
thereon has in each instance been withheld and deducted by the employer or
employers from the gross amount of the entire earnings of the employee-
taxpayer, and where the resident employer of the employee has filed a report or
return in which the employee’s entire and only earnings are reported to the
Commissioner, and where the employee has no taxable income other than the
earnings and the tax so withheld has been paid to the Commissioner, the
employee need not file a return.
      (5)   An employee who is permitted to deduct business expenses from
wages, salaries, or commissions must file a return in order to claim the
deductions even though all or part of the qualifying wages, salaries, or
commissions are subject to withholding.
      (6)   Any taxpayer who received taxable income not subject to withholding
under the regulations must file a return.
      (7)   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for which
a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business covering
the same or a different period, is required to file only one return.
      (8)   Trustees of active trusts are required to file returns and pay the
tax on the taxable income thereof.
      (9)   A husband and wife may, in any tax year, elect to file separate or
joint returns.
      (10)   Operating losses from business or professional activities, the
profits of which would be taxable under the regulations, may be offset against
salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other personal service
compensation, or against net profits from other business or professional
activities. To the extent that the losses are offset, they shall not be
allowable as an operating loss carry forward under §
35.03(A) of the regulations.
   (B)   Information required and reconciliation with federal returns.
      (1)   In returns filed hereunder, there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, qualifying wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions,
fees, and other compensation subject to the tax earned from each employer,
taxable net profits, and other pertinent information as the Commissioner may
require.
      (2)   Where figures of total income, total deductions, and net profits
are included as shown by a federal return, any items of income as are not
subject to the Village of Anna tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated
in determining net income subject to the Village of Anna. In the absence of
records showing the actual unallowable expenses, the expenses shall be
determined in accordance with the adjusted federal taxable income as defined in
§
35.02 of these regulations. The fact that any taxpayer is not required to file
a federal tax return does not relieve him or her from filing a Village of Anna
tax return.
      (3)   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the Federal
Internal Revenue Service, or by a judicial decision, results in an additional
amount of tax payable to the Village of Anna, a report of the change shall be
filed by the taxpayer within three months after receipt of the final notice
from the Federal Internal Revenue Service or final court decision.
      (4)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes due and paid to the Village of Anna a claim for refund shall be filed
with the Commissioner as prescribed in §
35.05 of the regulations and §
35.11(B) of these regulations.
   (C)   Extensions.

postmarked on or before the date for filing the return, the Commissioner will
extend the time for filing the return for 45 days beyond the date granted by
the Federal Internal Revenue Service. Whenever he or she deems it necessary,
the Commissioner may require a tentative return accompanied by payment of the
estimated tax. No penalty will be assessed in those cases in which the return
is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended provided an
estimated tax, equal to or greater than 90% of the taxpayer’s previous year’s
liability, is paid on or before the original filing date of the return.
Interest will be assessed on any remaining balance found to be due upon receipt
of the extended tax return and that all other filing and payment requirements
of the regulations have been met.
      (2)   Information returns, schedules, and statements needed to support
tax returns are to be filed within the time limits set forth for filing the tax
returns.
   (D)   Payment with return.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of §
35.06 of the regulations, or where any portion of the tax shall have been paid
by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of §
35.07 of the regulations, or where an income tax has been paid to another
municipality, credit for the amount so paid, in accordance with §
35.15 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
of Anna is entitled under the provisions of the regulations may have the
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, the overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall
be collected or refunded.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §§
35.11 and
35.12. The amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Commissioner, A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s Village of Anna tax liability, the taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village of Anna return showing income subject to
the Village of Anna tax based upon the final determination of federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for

§ 35.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Duty of withholding.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, it is the duty of each
employer within or doing business within the Village of Anna, who employs one
or more persons, whether as an employee, officer, director, or otherwise, to
deduct each time any compensation is paid the tax of 1% and 3/4% from:
         (a)   Qualifying wages, to include bonuses, incentive payments, fees,
commissions, or other forms of compensation paid to residents of the Village of
Anna, regardless of the place where the services are rendered; and
         (b)   All compensation paid nonresidents for services rendered, work
performed, or other activities engaged in within the Village of Anna.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the Village of Anna
are required to make the collections and deductions specified in this section,
regardless of the fact that the services on account of which any particular
deduction is required, as to residents of the Village of Anna, were performed
outside the Village of Anna.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain permanent office or place of business
in the Village of Anna, but who are subject to tax on net profits attributable
to Village of Anna, under the method of allocation provided for in the
regulations, are considered to be employers within Village of Anna and subject
to the requirement of withholding.
      (4)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation paid. If the employer has withheld the tax and failed to pay the
tax withheld to the Commissioner, the employee is not liable for the tax so
withheld.
      (5)   Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers, and others
who are independent contractors, and not employees of the payor, are not
subject to withholding or collection of the tax at the source. The taxpayers
must in all instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax pursuant to
the provisions of §§
35.05 and
35.07 of the regulations.
      (6)   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without Village of Anna, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold, and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the Village of Anna in accordance
with the following rules of apportionment.
         (a)   If the nonresident is a sales person, agent, or other employee
whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or
chiefly effected by him or her, the deducting and withholding shall attach to
the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted
or chiefly effected by the employee within the Village of Anna bears to the
total volume of business transacted by him or her within and outside the
Village of Anna.
         (b)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation
of other nonresident employees, including officers of corporations, shall
attach to the proportion of the personal service compensation of the employee
which the total number of his or her working hours within the Village of Anna
is of the total number of working hours.
         (c)   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the allocation of pay for time worked in the Village of
Anna on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in the
Village of Anna will be computed on the basis of a 40-hour week unless the
employer notifies the Commissioner that a greater or lesser number of hours per
week is worked.
         (d)   The occasional entry into the Village of Anna of a nonresident
employee who performs the duties for which he or she is employed primarily
outside the village, shall not be deemed to take the employee out of the class
of those rendering their services entirely outside the Village of Anna.
      (7)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (8)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses necessarily and
actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of his or her
services, provided the expenses are incurred in earning compensation, including
commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the employee under §
35.03 of these regulations.
      (9)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a nonresident of
the Village of Anna, and has no knowledge to the contrary, shall be relieved of
the responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid
to the employee for services rendered or work done outside the Village of Anna
by the employee, provided, however, that the employer must withhold the tax on
all personal service compensation paid the employee after the Commissioner
notifies the employer in writing that the employee is a resident of the Village
of Anna. All employees are required to notify the employer of any change of
residence and the date thereof.
      (10)   A Village of Anna employer required to withhold the tax from a
Village of Anna resident for work done or services performed in another
municipality, and who does so withhold and remit to the other municipality,
shall be relieved from the requirement of withholding the Village of Anna tax
from the Village of Anna resident, except where the rate of tax for the other
municipality is less than the rate of tax imposed by the regulations, in that
case the employer shall withhold and remit the difference to the Village of
Anna.
      (11)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the qualifying
wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or
about the person’s residence, but the employee shall be subject to all the
requirements of the regulations.
      (12)   On and after January 1, 2001, compensation paid to an individual
for personal services performed within the Village of Anna, if the individual
does not reside in the Village of Anna, performs personal services in the
Village of Anna on 12 or fewer days in the calendar year and, if the individual
is an employee, the principal place of business of the employer is located
outside the Village of Anna, the employer is exempt from withholding the tax
from the employee.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax withheld and status of employers.
      (1)   (a)   The deductions from salaries, qualifying wages, and other
compensation required to be made by employers are to begin with the
compensation earned on and after the effective date of the regulations.
         (b)   The employer (in addition to any return required to be filed
with respect to his or her own earnings or net profits) shall, on or before the
last day of the month next following each quarterly period, make a return and
pay to the Commissioner the full amount of the tax so deducted or withheld with
respect to compensation paid all of his or her employees subject to the tax
under the regulations. Provided, however, that where he or she deems the
precaution necessary, the Commissioner may require an employer to remit
withholding taxes at more frequent intervals. The return required to be filed
under this chapter shall be made on a form furnished by or obtainable on
request from the Commissioner.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by the
regulations is withheld from an employee’s pay, the excess may be refunded by
the employer or the Commissioner, depending upon the circumstances and the time
when the over-withholding is determined as follows.
         (a)   Current employees.
            1.   If the over-withholding is discovered in the same quarterly
period, the employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the
employee, and the amount to be reported on the quarterly form as withheld shall
be the corrected amount.
            2.   If the over-withholding is discovered in a subsequent quarter
of the same calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the
employee. In that case the form for the quarter in which the adjustment is made
shall indicate the total amount actually withheld, the amount of the adjustment
deducted therefrom, and the corrected amount reported on the report.
            3.   If the over-withholding is discovered in the following year,
the employer should notify the Commissioner of the over-withholding and the
circumstances thereof. Upon proper verification, the Commissioner shall refund
to the employee the amount of the excess withholding, upon request of the
taxpayer.
         (b)   Former employees.
            1.   In case too much has been withheld from an employee who is no
longer employed by the employer, the employer shall notify the Commissioner of
the amount and the circumstances of the overwithholding and the Commissioner
shall then refund to the employee the amount of the excess withholding, upon
request of the taxpayer; or
            2.   If the error is discovered by the employee, the employee shall
file a claim with the Commissioner and, upon verification thereof by the
employer, the Commissioner shall refund to the employee the amount of the
excess withholding upon request of the taxpayer.
         (c)   Nonresidents employed outside the village. Where an employer has
withheld the tax from all qualifying wages of a nonresident of the Village of
Anna, and the nonresident has been employed outside of the Village of Anna for
all or a part of the time, the employee shall file a claim with the
Commissioner covering the erroneous withholding and the Commissioner shall,
upon verification thereof by the employer, refund to the employee the amount of
the excess withholding upon request of the taxpayer.
         (d)   Insufficient withholding.
            1.   If less than the amount of tax required to be deducted is
withheld from an employee, the deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent
qualifying wages.
            2.   However, if the employee-employer relationship has terminated,
the employer shall notify the Commissioner of the deficiency and the reason.
      (3)   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee for the Village of Anna in
collecting and holding the tax required under the regulations to be withheld,
and the funds so collected by the withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
      (4)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Village of Anna for payment of the tax,
whether actually collected from the employee or not.
      (5)   On or before the last day of February following any calendar year
in which the deductions have been made by an employer, the employer shall file
with the Commissioner, in the form prescribed by the Commissioner, an
information return for each employee from whom the Village of Anna income tax
has been withheld, showing the name, address, and social security number of the
employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year, and the amount
of the Village of Anna income tax withheld from the employee.
      (6)   For the convenience of employers, the information return may be
made in one of three ways at the election of each employer, as follows.
         (a)   Those employers using Form W-2 furnished commercially, may
submit a copy of the commercial Form W-2, providing the copy furnished the
Village of Anna clearly shows the information required in division (B)(5)
immediately preceding.
         (b)   Those employers not using Form W-2 furnished commercially may
obtain forms upon request from the Commissioner at a nominal fee.
         (c)   Where the furnishing of this information as above indicated will
create a distinct hardship, the employer, upon written request to the
Commissioner, may be permitted to furnish a list of all employees subject to
the tax, which list shall show the employee’s full name, last known address,
social security number, gross amount of compensation paid during the year, and
the amount of the Village of Anna income tax withheld. The list may be compiled
on any mechanical equipment presently used by the employer, but provision must
be made for spacing equal to at least three lines between each name. The
employer’s name must be indicated on each sheet, each sheet must be numbered,
and the total number of sheets comprising the complete report indicated on the
first page.
         (d)   The gross compensation to be reported for each employee shall be
for the full 12 calendar months of the year or the portion thereof as the
employee reported on was employed.
      (7)   In addition to the information returns, and at the time the same
are filed, the employer shall file with the Commissioner a form to enable the
Commissioner to reconcile the sum total of compensation paid and taxes withheld
as disclosed by information return W-2, or list of employees, and prior returns
and remittances made pursuant to the regulations.
      (8)   Every employer, individual, or business conducting business inside
the Village of Anna and paying for services, labor, bonuses, awards, or other
types of compensation and reporting the payment on a Federal Form 1099 is
required to file a copy of the Federal Form 1099 with the Department of
Taxation on or before February 28 of each year.
   (C)   Fractional parts of cent. In deducting and withholding the tax at the
source, and in payment of any tax due under the regulations, a fractional part
of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to ½ cent or more, in which
case it shall be increased to one cent.

   (A)   Requirement of filing.
      (1)   A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed by every taxpayer who

will not be withheld by an employer or employers. Where required, the
declaration shall be filed within four months after the beginning of the
taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer’s final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for computing his or her declaration of estimated tax for the current
year. In the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a
return, a declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed in
good faith.
   (B)   Date of filing.
      (1)   A person or other entity conducting a business not previously
subject to the tax, or whose employer does not withhold the tax, shall file a
declaration within four months after the date he or she becomes subject to the
tax.
      (2)   Those taxpayers having a fiscal year or period differing from the
calendar year shall file a declaration within four months after the start of
each fiscal year or period.
   (C)   Form for filing.
      (1)   The declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished by,
or obtainable from, the Commissioner. Provided, however, credit shall be taken
for the Village of Anna tax to be withheld from any portion of income. In
accordance with the provisions of §
35.15, credit may be taken for tax to be withheld and remitted to another
taxing municipality.
      (2)   (a)   The original estimate of tax liability or any subsequent
amendment thereof may be increased or decreased by filing an amended
declaration on or before any quarterly payment date as set forth in division
(D)(1) below.
         (b)   The amendment may be made on the regular declaration form or on
the back of any quarterly notice.
   (D)   Dates of payments.
      (1)   The estimated tax may be paid in full with the declaration or in
equal installments on or before the last day of the fourth, seventh, tenth, and
thirteenth month after the beginning of the taxable year. Corporations,
partnerships, or other like business entities must remit the estimated tax on
the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year and the
fifteenth day of the sixth month, the fifteenth day of the ninth month, and the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year. A grace
period of 15 days will be granted for the filing of the declaration and payment
of the estimated tax as imposed on all taxpayers whose estimated tax liability
is due on the fifteenth day of any calendar month.
      (2)   The declaration must be accompanied by at least 22.5% of the
estimated tax shown due thereon.
      (3)   In the event an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
   (E)   Final returns required.
      (1)   The filing of a declaration does not relieve the taxpayer of the
necessity of filing a final return even though there is no change in the
declared tax liability.
      (2)   A final return must be filed to obtain a refund of any overpayment
of over $1.

authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under the regulations.
      (5)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due, shall cause the

and records and the attendance of all persons before him or her whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever he or she believes the persons have knowledge of
the facts concerning any supposed income or supposed transaction of the
taxpayer.
      (2)   The Commissioner’s order to examine any document mentioned in the
preceding division (B)(1) shall state whether the examination is to be at the
office of the taxpayer or at the office of the Commissioner.
      (3)   The Commissioner may order the appearance before him or her, or his
or her duly authorized agent, of any party whom he or she believes to have any
knowledge of a taxpayer’s income or withholdings, or any information pertaining

has actual custody of the records of the taxpayer being investigated. The
Commissioner is specifically authorized to order the appearance of the local
manager or representative of any taxpayer.
      (4)   Persons required to attend any hearings shall be notified no less

      (2)   In addition to interest as provided in division (A)(1), penalties
based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows: the taxpayer upon whom
the taxes are imposed and any employer required by this chapter to deduct,
withhold, and pay taxes imposed by this chapter shall be liable in addition
hereto to a penalty of 5% of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month after
the tax becomes due up to a maximum of 25%.
      (3)   All delinquent tax accounts outsourced by the Village to a law firm
or collection agency shall be assessed a collection fee on the entire balance
due equal to the contingency collection percentage charged by each law firm or
collection agency as set forth in the collection contract with the village. The
balance due prior to the assessment of the collection fee shall be the
principal balance due plus interest, penalties, late fees, and/or other
permissible fines, penalties and charges. The collection fee shall be assessed
against all payments made by the taxpayer whether or not the balance due is
paid in full with one payment, or over time with more than one payment. The
assessment of the collection fee shall be made by the law firm or collection
agency after the delinquent account has been outsourced for collection.
Additionally, court costs shall be added to the balance due as they are
incurred but shall not be assessed a collection fee.
   (B)   (1)   Penalty and interest shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Commissioner when a return has been filed in good faith
and the tax paid thereon within 30 days and provided further, that, in the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
      (2)   Upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Taxation, the Board of
Review may abate a penalty or interest or both, or upon an appeal from the
refusal of the Commissioner of Taxation to recommend abatement of penalty and
interest, the Board of Review may nevertheless abate penalty or interest or

within the prescribed time.
      (2)   In the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional taxes resulting from a federal audit for federal
income tax purposes, provided an amended return is filed and the additional tax
paid within three months after final determination of the federal tax
liability.
   (D)   Appeal from assessment. Upon recommendation of the Commissioner, the
Board of Review may abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from
the refusal of the Commissioner to recommend abatement of penalty and interest,

§ 35.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUND OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (A)   Unpaid sums - a civil debt.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by the regulations and not paid when due become,
together with interest and penalties thereon, a debt due the village from the
taxpayer and are recoverable as are other debts by civil suit. Employers who
are required, under §
35.06 of the regulations, to withhold and remit the taxes required to be
withheld at the source, and who fail to withhold and/or remit, become liable to
the village in a civil action to enforce the payment of the debt created by the
failure.
      (2)   No additional assessment shall be made by the Commissioner after
three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is later.
Provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation on the additional
assessments in the case of a return that omits a substantial portion of income,
or filing a false or fraudulent return to evade payment of the tax or failure
to file a return. Failure to report 25% or more of gross income shall be
considered a substantial omission.
      (3)   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and
the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitations, the
period within which an assessment may be made by the Commissioner is extended
to three years from the time of final determination of federal tax liability.
   (B)   Refunds and overpayments.
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date on which the payment was made,
or the return was due, or three months after the determination of the federal
income tax liability, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he or she has
complied with all provisions of the regulations and has furnished all
information required by the Commissioner, and has paid all taxes, penalties and
interest from any given year shown to be due.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer’s
current year’s liability at his or her option. Where no election has been made
by the taxpayer, overpayments of any year’s taxes shall be applied as follows.
         (a)   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in which the
taxes become due.
         (b)   To his or her current estimated tax liability.
   (C)   Limitation.
      (1)   Where the total amount due or refund claimed for a tax year is less
than $1 the amount shall not be collected or refunded.
      (2)   Overpayments due to rounding will not be credited or refunded.
      (3)   An adjustment to a tax return by the Department of Taxation, after
the return has been filed in good faith by the taxpayer, will not be made by
the Department if the result of the adjustment is equal to or less than $5 as
an underpayment or an overpayment of tax.

offense, who shall:
      (1)   Fail, neglect, or refuse to make any return or declaration required

returns relating to the income or net profits of a taxpayer;
      (6)   Fail to appear before the Commissioner and to produce his or her

notify an employer of any change in residence address and date thereof;
      (10)   Fail to use ordinary diligence in maintaining proper records of
employees’ residence addresses, total qualifying wages paid, and Anna tax
withheld, or to knowingly give the Commissioner false information; or
      (11)   Attempt to do anything whatever to avoid the payment of the whole
or any part of the tax, penalties, or interest imposed by these regulations.
   (B)   Prosecutions. Prosecutions under the regulations must be commenced
within five years from the time of the offense, except in the case of failure
to file a return or in the case of filing a false or fraudulent return, in
which event the limitation of time within which prosecution must be commenced
shall be ten years from the date the return was due or the date the false or
fraudulent return was filed.
   (C)   Failure to receive forms - not a defense. The failure of any employer
or person to receive or procure a return, declaration, or other required form
shall not excuse him or her from making any information return declaration or
return, from filing the form, or from paying the tax.

the village who receive pass through income from a nonresident business when
that business is obligated to pay the tax on the net profits of the business to

      (1)   A resident will receive automatic credit when it is shown that the
business entity is entirely situated in another taxing jurisdiction and that

         (a)   The rate of tax imposed by the other taxing jurisdiction;
         (b)   The rate of tax in effect in the other city; and
         (c)   The credit shall not exceed the rate in effect for the Village
of Anna.
      (2)   A resident will receive credit for taxes paid to other Ohio
municipalities when evidence is presented that the business allocated income
and paid the tax to other Ohio cities. The credit will be limited to:

village.
         (b)   The credit will be calculated using the same percentage as the
stock ownership or the partner’s share of profit and loss, of the resident for
that year.
      (4)   (a)   Under no circumstance shall the Village of Anna tax be
imposed on the same income more than once in any given year.
         (b)   A resident who pays the tax on his or her distributive share of

activity outside of Village of Anna, shall not pay the tax on the net profits
of the business to the Village of Anna.
         (c)   A resident who pays the tax on his or her distributive share of
income from a nonresident business entity that allocates a portion of the net

percentage of ownership or the partner’s share of profit and loss in that year.
   (D)   Method of applying for credit.

her final return or other form prescribed by the Commissioner, and presents the
evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality, as the
Commissioner may require.

authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a Village of
Anna resident or his or her employer is paying the tax shall be considered as
fulfilling the requirement of the article.
      (3)   No credit shall be given to a nonresident employee who lives in a
municipality that does not allow credit for taxes paid to other cities. In

§ 36.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL

   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer, and collect a
municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 1690-15,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 35 and adds Chapter
36 in accordance with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the

for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter 35 effective

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the

used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible

profit that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce
municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for
more years than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            2.   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (C)(1)

year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer

or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as

income is otherwise included in income, reduced by allowable employee business
expense deduction as found in §

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Domicile” means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
municipality for all or part of the taxable year.

period” with the municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual’s abode located outside of the municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the municipality. For purposes of this section, the state’s
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (C)   All applicable factors are provided in R.C. § 718.012.

§ 36.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
§ 36.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
36.052 of this chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under § 36.091 of this chapter.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

      (6)   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary

      (7)   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s

         If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee’s
“principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of
this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for “municipal
corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), and (F) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the
municipality.
         (b)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the municipality. For the purposes of this division, “presumed

either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages as provided
in §
36.051 of this chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
36.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of §
36.051 of this chapter.

§ 36.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
   (B)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person’s winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of $500 for each return not filed or filed late. Interest
shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the rate prescribed
in R.C. § 5703.47.
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of §
36.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

INDIVIDUALS.
   “Municipal taxable income” for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income” reduced by “exempt income” to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any “pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward” equals “municipal taxable income”.
      (1)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “net
profit” of the taxpayer.
         (a)   “Net Profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
§
36.03(C)(23).
         (b)   “Adjusted federal taxable income” is defined in §
36.03(C)(1) of this chapter.
      (2)   “Exempt income” is defined in §
36.03(C)(11) of this chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by §
36.062 of this chapter.

36.03(C)(32) of this chapter.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not-required to be withheld under §
36.052 of this chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
36.081 of this chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under §
36.03(C)(11)(l) and (C)(34)(a)4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   “Consolidated federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   “Consolidated federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.

   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

income” for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
36.03(C)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.062 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
36.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under §
36.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
36.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
36.091 of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

§ 36.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Limitation. Where a resident of the Village of Anna is subject to a
municipal tax, on or measured by income, in another municipality either located
within or without the State of Ohio, he or she shall not pay a total municipal
tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Credits to residents. Resident individuals of the Village of Anna who
are required to pay and do pay tax to another municipality on salaries,
qualifying wages, commissions, or other compensation for work done or services
performed in other municipality or on net profits from businesses, professions,
or other activities conducted in any other municipality, may claim a credit of
the amount of tax paid by them or on their behalf to the other municipality but
only to the extent of 1% and additional 3/4% tax imposed by the regulations and
§
36.03 on the compensation or net profits.
   (C)   Credits for taxes paid at the entity level by Subchapter S
corporations and partnerships. Credit shall be given to resident individuals of
the village who receive pass through income from a nonresident business when
that business is obligated to pay the tax on the net profits of the business to
another Ohio municipality.
      (1)   A resident will receive automatic credit when it is shown that the
business entity is entirely situated in another taxing jurisdiction and that
100% of the income is taxable to that municipality. The credit will be limited
to:
         (a)   The rate of tax imposed by the other taxing jurisdiction;
         (b)   The rate of tax in effect in the other city; and
         (c)   The credit shall not exceed the rate in effect for the Village
of Anna.
      (2)   A resident will receive credit for taxes paid to other Ohio
municipalities when evidence is presented that the business allocated income
and paid the tax to other Ohio cities. The credit will be limited to:
         (a)   The percentage of ownership; and
         (b)   Shall not exceed the rate of tax in effect for the Village of
Anna in that year.
      (3)   (a)   A credit will be given to a resident who receives a
distributive share when the entity conducted a portion of its business inside
of the Village of Anna and paid the tax on the allocated net profits to the
village.
         (b)   The credit will be calculated using the same percentage as the
stock ownership or the partner’s share of profit and loss, of the resident for
that year.
      (4)   (a)   Under no circumstance shall the Village of Anna tax be
imposed on the same income more than once in any given year.
         (b)   A resident who pays the tax on his or her distributive share of
income from a nonresident business entity that conducted 100% of the business
activity outside of Village of Anna, shall not pay the tax on the net profits
of the business to the Village of Anna.
         (c)   A resident who pays the tax on his or her distributive share of
income from a nonresident business entity that allocates a portion of the net
profits to the Village of Anna and paid the tax thereon, shall receive a credit
for the tax paid to the Village of Anna by the business limited by the
percentage of ownership or the partner’s share of profit and loss in that year.
   (D)   Method of applying for credit.
      (1)   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims that on his or
her final return or other form prescribed by the Commissioner, and presents the
evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality, as the
Commissioner may require.
      (2)   A statement satisfactory to the Commissioner from the taxing
authority of the municipality to which the taxes are paid that a Village of
Anna resident or his or her employer is paying the tax shall be considered as
fulfilling the requirement of the chapter.
      (3)   No credit shall be given to a nonresident employee who lives in a
municipality that does not allow credit for taxes paid to other cities. In
these cases, the nonresident employee will be paying tax on the same income to
more than one municipality.

§ 36.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayers receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
36.081 of this chapter.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
36.096 of this chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
36.096, the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
36.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
36.081 of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
§ 36.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
36.051(C) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,

municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers shall file an annual municipal
income tax return with the municipality, regardless of income or liability.

required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person, or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer’s social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information

withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with

file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
36.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in §
36.092 of this chapter, the provision in §
36.092 of this chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under §
36.051 (B)(1)(b) of this chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in §
36.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as
credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with
the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in §
36.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall automatically receive

Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless the applicable

      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
36.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section,
the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under § 36.18 of this chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in division (A)

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was

Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
36.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 1690-15, passed 12-22-2015)
§ 36.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
      Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality, This member may be an employee of
the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such Board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board’s
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing, its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

§ 36.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
36.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
36.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
36.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by §
36.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:

imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in §
36.03(C)(47)(a) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the
election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§
718.80 to 718.95, §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter
5703.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the village, on a form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   (a)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and village of its termination
of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01 and §
36.03(C)(44) of the Village Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.02 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII,
unless the term is defined in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition
in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal
Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income
taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and §
36.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances. As used in §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. For a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as
described in R.C. § 718.01(D)(5) and §

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (1) of this definition, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (4)(b) of this definition,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (4)(a) of this definition does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
36.063(E)(3)(b) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
36.063(E)(3)(b) of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in §
36.03(C)(47)(b) of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in §
36.03(C)(23)(d)(1)-(6) of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in this definition shall be construed as allowing the taxpayer to
add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as allowing any
taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of federal self-
employment tax.
   ASSESSMENT. A notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax issued pursuant
to §§
36.17 to

the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the calculation of
the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant to this

purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal

for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   TAXPAYER. Has the same meaning as in §
36.03(C)(47)(a) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C.

§ 37.03 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the village and that has made the election under R.C. § 718.80.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under §
36.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A)(1)(a) to (b) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A)(1)(a) to (b) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the village
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the village only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the village from
a stock of goods located within the village.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the village from a location
outside the village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
village to the extent that such services are performed in the village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the village shall be sitused to the village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the village shall be sitused to the
village.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the village.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under §
36.03(C)(11) and (34) of the Codified Ordinances by the village or
substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal
corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the village. In no case shall
a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
village any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
village under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

apportionable to the village under this chapter for any prior year:

shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the Village
Tax Administrator under R.C. § 718.83(D).
   (E)   (1)   The village expects that the Tax Commissioner will, pursuant to
R.C. § 718.84(E), provide tax returns and other information it receives in the
performance of its administration of the municipal net profits tax for
taxpayers making the election provided in R.C. § 718.80. The Tax Administrator
shall review these returns and information, as well as the information received
pursuant to divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer
any taxpayer for audit by the Tax Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on
a form prescribed by the Commissioner and shall include any information that
forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, the village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

36.062, of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)   The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

information.
         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division

Commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.

including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (D)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
Commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (B)   A taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

§ 37.07 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.

valid election made by the taxpayer under §
36.063(B)(1) or (2) of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the Tax
Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
36.03 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under §
36.03(B) of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in R.C. § 718.82, exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section R.C. § 718.82 include
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in R.C. § 718.82 exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under R.C. § 718.82 by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.

§ 37.08 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80 fails
to pay any tax as required under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment
until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under §§
36.17 to
36.19 and §
36.03(C)(2)(a)(1) to (5), and (2)(b) of the Codified Ordinances, whichever

factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in R.C. §
718.85(B).
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return for
that year.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.10 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties
shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax
Commissioner, the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month
or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between
the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall
not exceed $150.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the Commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under R.C. §
718.80 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to 15% of the amount not
timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§
36.096 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of $1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under §§
36.17 to
36.19 and §
36.03(C)(2)(a)(1)-(5) and (2)(b) of the Codified Ordinances without regard to
any time limitation for the assessment imposed by §
36.19(A) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under R.C. §
718.83.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.11 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   (1)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's
possession.
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against
a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in §
36.096 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within 60
days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the Office of
the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      (1)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the Clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special
judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      (2)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60 days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47
from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is
paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C.
§ 131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the
Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the Clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is
pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or
pursuant to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the
determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the
taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there
shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund
in the amount of the overpayment as provided by §
36.096 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by §§
36.17 to
36.19 and §
36.03(C)(2)(a)(1)-(5) and (2)(b). The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than $10 and not less than that claimed,
the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget and
management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10 but less than
that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-
first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.13 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
R.C. § 718.80 and used to determine the tax due under §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer
or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §§
36.17 to
36.19 and §
36.03(C)(2)(a)(1)-(5) and (2)(b) of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of
assessing any additional tax due under this section, together with any
applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no
longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the 60-day period prescribed for filing the amended
return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in §
36.096 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
36.096 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.14 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
Commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to §§
36.01 to
36.23 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
Commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.15 CREDITS.
   (A)   A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the village pursuant
to §§
36.064 or
36.065 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be available to a taxpayer that has
made the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, against the municipal
corporation's tax on income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following
information to the Tax Commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018,
or the thirty-first day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is
eligible to receive the credit:
      (1)   A copy of the agreement entered into by the village and taxpayer
under §§
36.064 or
36.065 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (2)   A copy of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the agreement
entered into between the village and the taxpayer.
   (B)   (1)   Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the village granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the village and taxpayer under §§
36.064 or
36.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.
(Ord. 1748-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 37.99 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever recklessly

first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or
imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.
   (B)   Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of §
36.14(A) of the Codified Ordinances constitutes a separate offense.
   (C)   These specific penalties shall not be construed to prevent the village
from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.

(Ord. 1481-06, passed 6-27-2006; Am. Ord. 1744-18, passed 2-13-2018)
§ 38.05 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (A)   Introduction. It is the policy of the village that openness leads to
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the village to strictly adhere to the state’s
Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their
narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request
must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined
in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must
also be in writing.
   (B)   Public records.
      (1)   The village, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
records as including the following: any document — paper, electronic including,
but not limited to, e-mail, or other format - that is created or received by,
or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of the office. All records of the village are public unless they are
specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   It is the policy of the village that, as required by Ohio law,
records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying. See division (E) below of this section for the e-mail
record policy. Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and
posted prominently.
   (C)   Record requests. Although no specific language is required to make a
request, the requester must at least identify the records requested with
sufficient clarity to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review
the records. If it is not clear what records are being sought, the records
custodian must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requestor in revising the request by informing the requestor of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
      (1)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office’s general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
      (2)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
      (3)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. All requests for public records must
either be satisfied or be acknowledged in writing by the village within three
business days following the office’s receipt of the request. If a request is
deemed significantly beyond “routine,” such as seeking a voluminous number of

§ 38.06 IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (A)   Program adoption. The Village of Anna, Ohio (“Village”) developed this
Identity Theft Prevention Program (“Program”) pursuant to the Federal Trade
Commission’s Red Flags Rule (“Rule”), which implements Section 114 of the Fair
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. This program
was developed with oversight and approval of the Village Council. After
consideration of the size and complexity of the village’s operations and
account systems, and the nature and scope of the village’s activities, the
Village Council determined that this program was appropriate for the village,
and therefore approved this program.
   (B)   Program purpose and definitions.
      (1)   Fulfilling requirements of the Red Flags Rule. Under the Red Flag
Rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an
“Identity Theft Prevention Program” tailored to its size, complexity and the
nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and
procedures to:
         (a)   Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered
accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program;
         (b)   Delete red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
         (c)   Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to
prevent and mitigate identity theft; and
         (d)   Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes
in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from
identity theft.
      (2)   Red Flags Rule definitions used in this program.
         (a)   The Red Flags Rule defines IDENTITY THEFT as “fraud committed
using the identifying information of another person” and a RED FLAG as a
pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence
of identity theft.
         (b)   According to the rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject
to the rule requirements. The rule defines CREDITORS “to include finance
companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and
telecommunications companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer
payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors.”
         (c)   All the village’s accounts that are individual utility service
accounts held by customers of the village whether residential, commercial or
industrial are covered by the rule. Under the rule, a COVERED ACCOUNT is:
            1.   Any account the village offers or maintains primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or
transactions; and
            2.   Any other account the village offers or maintains for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and
soundness of the village from identity theft.
         (d)   IDENTIFYING INFORMATION is defined under the rule as “any name
or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information
to identify a specific person,” including: name, address, telephone number,
social security number, date of birth, government issued driver’s license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification
number, computer’s internet protocol address, or routing code.
   (C)   Identification of red flags. In order to identify relevant red flags,
the village considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the
methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its
accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The village
identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories:
      (1)   Notification and warnings from credit reporting agencies, if
applicable. Red flags:
         (a)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
         (b)   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
         (c)   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert
for an applicant; and
         (d)   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer’s usual pattern or activity.
      (2)   Suspicious documents. Red flags:
         (a)   Identification document or card that appears to be forged,
altered or inauthentic;
         (b)   Identification document or card on which a person’s photograph
or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the
document;
         (c)   Other document with information that is not consistent with
existing customer information (such as if a person’s signature on a check
appears forged); and
         (d)   Application for service that appears to have been altered or
forced.
      (3)   Suspicious personal identifying information. Red flags:
         (a)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with
other information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);
         (b)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with
other sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address
on a credit report);
         (c)   Identifying information presented that is the same as
information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
         (d)   Identifying information presented that is consistent with
fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address);
         (e)   Social security number presented that is the same as one given
by another customer;
         (f)   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
         (g)   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying
information on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social
security numbers must not be required); and
         (h)   A person’s identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
      (4)   Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account. Red flags:
         (a)   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change
the account holder’s name;
         (b)   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account;
         (c)   Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use
(example: very high activity);
         (d)   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
         (e)   Notice to the village that a customer is not receiving mail sent
by the village;
         (f)   Notice to the village that an account has unauthorized activity;
         (g)   Breach in the village’s computer system security; and
         (h)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
      (5)   Alerts from others. Red flags: Notice to the village from a
customer, identity theft victim, law enforcement or other person that it has
opened or is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity
theft.
   (D)   Detecting red flags.
      (1)   New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified
above associated with the opening of a new account, village personnel will take
the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
         (a)   Detect.
            1.   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of
birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an
entity, driver’s license or other identification;
            2.   Verify the customer’s identity (for instance, review a
driver’s license or other identification card);
            3.   Review documentation showing the existence of a business
entity; and
            4.   Independently contact the customer.
      (2)   Existing accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags
identified above for an existing account, village personnel with take the
following steps to monitor transactions with an account:
         (a)   Detect.
            1.   Verify the identification of customers if they request
information (in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email);
            2.   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses;
and
            3.   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and
payment purposes.
   (E)   Preventing and mitigating identity theft. In the event village
personnel detect any identified red flags, such personnel shall take one or
more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red
flag:
      (1)   Prevent and mitigate.
         (a)   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft;
         (b)   Contact the customer;
         (c)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit
access to accounts;
         (d)   Not open a new account;
         (e)   Close an existing account;
         (f)   Reopen an account with a new number;
         (g)   Notify the Fiscal Officer for determination of the appropriate
steps to take;
         (h)   Notify law enforcement; or
         (i)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
      (2)   Protect customer identifying information. In order to further
prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to village
accounts, the village will take the following steps with respect to its
internal operating procedures to protect customers identifying information:
         (a)   Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that
the website is not secure;
         (b)   Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and
computer files containing customer information;
         (c)   Ensure that office computers are password protected and that
computer screens lock after a set period of time;
         (d)   Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information;
         (e)   Request only the last four digits of social security numbers (if
any);
         (f)   Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and
         (g)   Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that is
necessary for utility and other necessary purposes.
   (F)   Program administration.  
      (1)   Program updates. This program will be periodically reviewed and
updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the
village from identity theft. At least once a year, the Fiscal Officer will
consider the village’s experiences with identity theft situations, changes in
identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention
methods, changes in types of accounts the village maintains and changes in the
village’s business arrangements with other entities. After considering these
factors, the Fiscal Officer will determine whether changes to the program,
including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the Fiscal
Officer will update the program or present the Village Council with his or her
recommended changes and the Village Council will make a determination whether
to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program.
      (2)   Staff training and reports. Village staff responsible for
implementing the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of
the Fiscal Officer in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to
be taken when a red flag is detected. Village staff will report to the Fiscal
Officer any incidents of identity theft.
      (3)   Service provider arrangements. In the event the village engages a
service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more
accounts, the village will take the following steps to ensure the service
provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and
procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft.
         (a)   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies
and procedures in place; and
         (b)   Require, by contract, that service provider’s review the
village’s program and report any red flags to the Fiscal Officer.
      (4)   Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the
effectiveness of Identity Theft Prevention Programs, the Red Flag Rule
envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the village’s specific
practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation.
Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be
limited to the Mayor, Village Council and those employees who need to know them
for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be
adopted by a public body and this publicly available, it would be
counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the
program’s general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices
are listed in this document.

REGULATIONS
§ 51.01 GENERAL.
   (A)   No physical connection shall be maintained between any other source of
water or liquid and the village water supply piping. No spigot or outlet shall
be physically connected to a drain or sewer or be submerged. The proper cross-
connection prevention device shall be installed in accordance with the village
and OEPA regulations.
   (B)   There shall be no electrical ground of A/C and/or D/C power source
permitted on the water system or any private extension thereof.
   (C)   A permit must be obtained by the property owner or a plumber engaged
by the property owner in order to receive a service line connection. At this
time the Administrator will check the property records to verify that all
assessments levied against the property have been paid prior to issuing the
permit. If the assessment and other charges levied have been paid, a permit
will then be issued; if not, the property owner must pay the assessments and
other charges levied before a permit is issued. Should a renewal of a service
be desired, a permit will be issued by the Administrator after it is determined
that there are no outstanding unpaid bills; then an employee of the village
will restore the service. If the connection is made without first obtaining a
proper permit, water service will be discontinued until a valid permit is
obtained.
   (D)   The owner of the property may have a service discontinued by request
to the village. The meter will be turned off or removed and water shut off at
the curb by the village. Should it not be possible to obtain a final reading, a
final invoice will be estimated on the time elapsed since the last reading and
the estimated consumption as determined by the village. Under no circumstances
shall the closing statement be less than the minimum rate prorated for the time
the water was used. When service is re-established, a reconnection charge will
be levied.
   (E)   All employees of the village, designated for the purpose with proper
identification, are authorized to enter, at reasonable hours, into any house,
building or place supplied with water from or connected to, or traversed by
water mains of the village, to examine bibs, pipes, meters, cisterns,
reservoirs, tanks or other apparatus for the purpose of ascertaining the
quantity of water consumed or supplied or for placing or taking away any meter,
instrument, pipe fitting or other material belonging to the village or for any
other reasonable purpose in connection with the water supply system.
   (F)   Meter reading.
      (1)   All meters will be read monthly.
      (2)   (a)   If the meter reader is unable to obtain a reading because a
meter is out of order, the meter will be replaced and the amount of water
consumed will be estimated. If the meter reader cannot gain entrance to a
building having an inside meter, he will leave a card upon which the user may
record the meter reading and return it to the village within five days.
         (b)   The village will base the current bill upon the reading sent in
by the customer. If a card is not returned, the bill will be estimated based
upon past consumption records. This will be done for no more than two
consecutive meter reading periods, or the village will have the service
discontinued.
   (G)   The village shall make a charge for any service requiring a special
trip to the property, such as temporary shut-offs. Only representatives of the
village are authorized to install, disconnect or remove water meters from a
service. Any meter not properly removed, which becomes lost or not recoverable,
shall be chargeable to the property owner. No person without a permit from the
village is allowed to turn a stop chock, hydrant or valve owned by the village
or on public right-of-way, other than as provided in the “Rules of Regulations”
governing plumbers, excepting, however, members of the Fire Department in the
performance of their duties. In case trouble occurs between the main and the
curb stop, or in the meter, the village should be called. If the trouble is
beyond the curb stop, it should be shut off and a plumber called.
   (H)   Service branches are installed at the expense of the property owner
who is held responsible at all times for any leakage that may occur between the
curb stop and the building. The plumber taking out the permit for the service
is responsible for one year after final inspection for any leaks developing
between the corporation stop in the water main and the curb stop. The village
has the right to replace any water meter it deems necessary.
   (I)   All meters must be accessible at all times. Failure to comply with
this rule will be cause for discontinuing service which will not be resumed
until the trouble has been remedied. This rule shall apply to meters in meter
pits which are covered with dirt or other materials or that are filled with
matter or gas, or where passage to meters is blocked so that the meters are not
accessible.
   (J)   The village will require each water service to have its own separate
accessible municipal shut off valve and box. All shut off valves must be clear
and accessible at all times so that water may be shut off as necessary by the
Public Works Department. No valve box shall be covered with concrete, asphalt
or other materials. The shut off valve and box shall be constructed pursuant to
village standards and the site selected by the village. The valve box will be
located prior to the meter. The valve box and shut off are the responsibility
of the owner to install and maintain. No person other the authorized village
personnel are permitted to turn water on or off at the shut off valve. If
current services do not comply with this chapter, they will need to be
retrofitted to meet village standards. The property owner will have 60 days
from notification to comply. If they do not comply within 60 days, service will
be terminated for that property or properties.
   (K)   The owner of the property may request turn-off in order to permanently
or temporarily terminate charges.
   (L)   A list of all current charges, fees, and rates for the various water
service performed are on file in the village office. These charges, fees, and
rates are subject to amendment by the village and are not to be construed as
being fixed for an indefinite period of time.
   (M)   Bills rendered to landlords having multiple establishments or
apartment units should be computed where the minimum billing shall not be less
than the minimum rate times the number of units.

51.99
§ 51.02 WATER METERS.
   (A)   No meter shall be set until the final inspection has been made and
approved, and an application for service has been filed. It is unlawful for
anyone to move into a residence until after final village inspection, approval,
and acceptance for metering.
   (B)   Any meter violation shall be considered as tampering with the water
system and shall carry the penalty as outlined by law.
   (C)   No extension, alterations or repairs shall be made to any water pipes
or fixtures within the public rights-of-way between meter and main line except
by a plumber and with the notification to the village.
   (D)   Meters are furnished to consumers by the village upon payment of the
utility connect fee and tap fee. The tap fee varies in accordance with the size
of the meter. A schedule of such charges is available at the village office.

§ 51.04 SERVICE PER RESIDENCE AND METER PIT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   There shall be but one single-family residence on a service branch and
each branch shall be metered.
   (B)   Each housing unit, business, or commercial structure shall have a
separate meter location as follows:
      (1)   Outside the structure and one foot outside the public road right-
of-way of the property to be served. No obstruction shall be placed on the
cover at any one time; or
      (2)   Inside the structure with a remote.
   (C)   The village may require properties or premises not so equipped to
install additional service lines, meter pits or remote meters at the expense of
the property owner.
   (D)   Meters, remote readers, meter pits and privately-owned hydrants or
plugs and all attachments must be kept in complete repair and kept accessible
by the owner or occupant, and protected from frost without expense to the
village.
   (E)   The owner must also provide curb stops and have the pipes so arranged
that the water may be drawn from them whenever there is danger of freezing. It
shall be the duty of the property owner to keep the meter pit at grade with the
surface. The owner shall conform to any written instructions from the village
as to grade of the meter pit and shall indemnify the village against any
damages or expense occasioned it by reason of the meter pit being above or
below grade. The village will make minor repairs and adjustments to the meter
pit provided, however, that the cost of any repairs made necessary by
negligence or abuse on the part of the owner shall be charged to the property
owner.
(Ord. 1036-93, passed 3-23-1993; Am. Ord. 1654-14, passed 7-8-2014)
§ 51.05 METER TESTING.
   The village will test and correct any meter which is registering incorrectly
without the consent of the owner, or upon his or her request, will test any of
its meters, and guarantee its accuracy against any overcharge within 2%. Proper
refund shall be made if the test shows the customer has been overcharged. In
order to protect the village against the unreasonable demands for this service,
a charge shall be made if the test shows the meter to be registering properly.
If a meter is found to be under-registering, the owner can be billed for under
charges for up to one year prior to and preceding the determination of under-
registering.
(Ord. 1036-93, passed 3-23-1993; Am. Ord. 1654-14, passed 7-8-2014)

to the village and no connection may be made without written permission from
the same.
   (B)   Fire service connections may be made by any registered plumber with
the approval of the village.
   (C)   No person except an authorized agent of the Fire Department or the
village shall use any valve, hydrant or fixture in association with a water
main. In case of fire or inspection, the Fire Department shall have the right
to use any hydrant, hose, pipe, or other fixture in association with a water
main. The Fire Department shall notify the Village Administrator of any use for
maintenance or training purposes.
   (D)   Developers of new subdivisions, or parts thereof, shall install all
water mains, fire hydrants, valves, fittings, and the like, at their expense.
All work performed shall be in accordance with plans and specifications
approved by the village.
   (E)   Water may be taken from fire hydrants fitted with special gate valves

see §
51.99
§ 51.07 BILLING METHODS AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Water service charges will be billed for any lot, parcel of land,
building, enterprise, residence, or premises provided an active water service
connection or device drawing water from the village water system. Owners of
property shall be held responsible for water used on their premises, but
statements may be mailed to another designated person or entity, such as an
agency or tenant. If the designated person, entity or tenant does not pay in
accordance with the “Rules and Regulations,” the owner shall be responsible for
payment. Account delinquency shall be just cause for terminating services,
which will be resumed only upon full payment of the delinquent charges.
Responsibility of payment rests with the current property owner. It is the
responsibility of the prospective property owner to inquire of possible
delinquent charges which may be assumed upon ownership. This information will
be given upon request to the village.
   (B)   Water service charges will be based upon readings taken from meters
installed in accordance with the village specifications, or in such manner and
by such method as may be practicable in the light of the conditions and
attendant circumstances of the case, as determined by the village.
   (C)   Water meters shall normally be read every month. In the event the
meter is not read, the average of the preceding quarter shall be used in
determining the monthly user charge. If so, the bill will be marked “estimate.”
The bill for the month following reading of the water meter shall include an
adjustment for the quarter.
   (D)   Should the village be unable to render monthly bills because of labor
shortage or some other deficiency, the bill may be rendered for a shorter or
longer period, but at the same monthly rate.
   (E)   Utility bills are sent out on about the last day of each month and
must be paid by the tenth (“due date”), unless the tenth is a weekend or legal
holiday, in which payment will be due on the next business day. Partial
payments are acceptable, but any amount not paid by the due date shall be
considered delinquent and subject to a “late payment penalty” as determined by
the village. A night deposit slot is located on the west side of the Town Hall
for convenience. If the utility bill is still not paid by the “shut off” date
as indicated on the bill (the 18th), service will be discontinued and not
reconnected until all charges have been paid in full. The Public Works employee
cannot accept payment for delinquent bills. The village will leave a disconnect
notice at the property indicating service has been disconnected and will remain
so until payment in full of all outstanding obligations are made. Any costs to
terminate and reactivate water service will be added to the delinquent charges.
There will be no exceptions to the above unless granted by the Village
Administrator. Any disputes on utility bills must be brought to his or her
attention before the bill becomes delinquent.
   (F)   If the owner/tenant disputes a water bill, he or she shall contact the
Village Administrator before the due date, to arrange a meeting to resolve any
billing disputes. The village shall not discontinue water service if a meeting
is pending with the Village Administrator and owner/tenant.
   (G)   The receipt by the village of a check for the payment of a water bill
that is not honored by the bank will be considered non-payment, and the village
will proceed with discontinuance of water service and other collection
activities as set forth in this section. If an owner within a 12-month period
provides the village with two dishonored checks, the owner in the future must
pay his or her water bill in cash or by certified funds or money order, until
further notified by the village.
   (H)   In the collection of water bills, the Village Administrator or his or
her designee has the discretion to certify the amount not paid, together with
any penalties and other charges, to the Shelby County Auditor and/or collect
the past due amounts together with penalty and charges by actions of law in the
name of the village from an owner who is liable to pay the bill.
   (I)   The Village Administrator has the discretion to arrange a payment
agreement with an owner for past due bills in the event of extraordinary
circumstances.

§ 51.08 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The village shall have the right to shut off the water for repairs,
extensions, test, improvements, or whenever necessary and will not be
responsible or held liable for any accidents or damage (including, but not
limited to, rust damage) which may result from interruption of service.
Whenever possible, as time permits, all customers will be notified prior to
such temporary discontinuance of service.
   (B)   The village shall maintain all lines on dedicated easements or rights-
of-way. No maintenance will be done on water mains that do not lie within
easements or dedicated rights-of-way. These lines shall be maintained by the
owner. Service shall be discontinued until repairs have been completed to the
satisfaction of the village.
   (C)   If a break or leak occurs in any service line between the main line
and the meter pit and/or curb stop, the village will repair this at its own
expense as soon as possible. The owner will be required to pay all costs of
repair to a service line on his or her property (meter pit and/or curb stop to
structure). The village shall not be responsible for breakage of pipes or
valves occurring during removal or installation of meters where such breakage
is due to old or faulty plumbing. Notice to replace inferior pipe will
constitute reasonable care. Failure to repair leaks, remove obstructions
preventing access to the meter pit or make payments of charges for work done by
the village for such purposes, when notified to do so, will be sufficient cause
for the village to enter the street and close the corporation stop which shall
not be reopened until the cause for the closing has been remedied.
   (D)   All charges for repairs to meters damaged by freezing or any other
cause must be paid when the next bill comes due.
   (E)   Damage to water meters resulting from improper connections between
boilers and furnaces or other heaters shall be the responsibility of the owner
and the cost of repairs will be charged to him or her.
   (F)   No extensions, alterations, or repairs shall be made to any water
pipes or fixtures between the meter pit and main line except by a plumber and
with the approval of the village.

see §
51.99
§ 51.09 TAMPERING WITH THE SYSTEM.
   (A)   No person other than an authorized agent of the village may connect to
any of its water lines, tamper with, or remove any meter or parts thereof or
any seal, or insert a meter by-pass without permission of the village under
penalty provided in the Ohio Revised Code. A tampering violation is also due
cause for having water service discontinued.
   (B)   If the village finds that a meter seal has been broken, a connection
installed ahead of the meter, any by-pass inserted, or there is evidence that
the meter has been tampered with, the water will be shut off and will not be
turned on again until the owner of the premises pays for the estimated quantity
of water which has been used and not registered, and in addition, shall pay a
fee for turning on the water. The criminal laws of the State of Ohio provide
severe penalties for tampering with water meters, meter seals, valves and other
devices in the water system. The penalties herein provided are in addition to
the penalties provided by the criminal laws of the State of Ohio, and the
payment of penalties herein mentioned will not in any way relieve any person
from prosecution.
   (C)   No person shall unlawfully secure a supply of water through a
corporation stop, curb stop, valve or other device after it has been closed for
the violation of any of the “Rules and Regulations” without first having
secured the necessary permit from the village.

see §
51.99
§ 51.10 GUARANTEE OF SUPPLY.
   (A)   The village does not guarantee any fixed pressure or a continuous
supply of water, but will, in an emergency, try to notify affected customers.
   (B)   Persons or entities using steam boilers, gas engines or other
equipment, or whose operation depends on a supply of water direct from the
service pipe, should have in mind the preceding rule and provide storage of
sufficient water to operate a reasonable length of time.
(Ord. 1036-93, passed 3-23-1993; Am. Ord. 1654-14, passed 7-8-2014)
§ 51.11 GUARANTEE OF SERVICE.
   Every reasonable effort will be attempted to restore service should an
interruption of service occur. The village shall not be liable for any
accidents or damage resulting from interruption of service or conditions caused
by the design limitations of the various systems. Temporary shutdowns of the
water supply by the village may be necessary for improvements or repairs.
Whenever possible, and as time permits, all customers will be notified prior to
shutdown.

§ 51.12 CONSTRUCTION WATER.
   (A)   Water used during construction shall be metered and billed to the
applicant for water service at the water rates in effect. A water meter shall
be installed after application is made for service and the corresponding tap-in
fees and water service connection charges paid.
   (B)   Should a meter not be installed, the monthly minimum rate will be
charged plus estimated usage. Any damage to the water meter during the
construction period will be the responsibility of the water service applicant.
(Ord. 1036-93, passed 3-23-1993; Am. Ord. 1654-14, passed 7-8-2014)

performed.
(Ord. 1036-93, passed 3-23-1993; Am. Ord. 1654-14, passed 7-8-2014)
§ 51.14 SPECIAL WATER METERS.
   (A)   Customers who use large amounts of water for various watering
activities or swimming pools may realize savings in charges by having a
separate meter installed to measure usage. Since sanitary sewer service charges
are based upon the amount of water consumed, adjustments to sewage charges can
be made by obtaining a special meter from the village office. No adjustment
will be made unless this special meter is used. There will be a deposit for the
use of this meter. Applications for a separate meter must be directed to the
Village Administrator and should be submitted to the Village Utility Clerk at
the Village Administration office. Residents who have a permanent swimming pool
installed may purchase a meter from the village to receive this adjustment.
   (B)   All rented meters must be returned by October 31. Any resident using
these special meters must provide the Village Utility Clerk with a monthly
meter reading between the 18th and 23rd of each month. Readings not turned in
on a monthly basis will constitute the resident losing the adjustment to the
sewage. The monthly sewer charge will never be less than the minimum charge.

payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the “Rules and
Regulations.”

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade- crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(R.C. § 4511.13) (Rev. 2014)
§ 70.32 SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the

“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person whose

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (A)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (A)(2) of this section. The

         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b)2. or (A)(4)(b)3.
of this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in
addition to or independent of any other sentence that it imposes upon the

for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.

The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially

   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating

of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J)) (Rev. 2012)
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has been

any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.

shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a

the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar

of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied
offenses of similar import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (E)   As used in this section, ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE
includes any of the following:
      (1)   A wireless telephone;

of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (D)   (1)   (a)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of division (A)(1)(a) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician- paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN- INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.02, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A)(1)(b),
(A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h), (A)(1)(i), or
(A)(1)(j) or (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3), or (B)(4) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions,
a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         (d)   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (F)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §

   (H)   Whoever violates division (B) of this section is guilty of operating a
motor vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as
follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (H)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited
driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any jail term
imposed under division (H)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (A)
of this section or other equivalent offenses, the offender is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed for
the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (B) of this section.
   (I)   (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment
program under this section unless the treatment program complies with the
minimum standards for alcohol treatment programs adopted under R.C. Chapter
5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (J)   If a person whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (K)   Division (A)(1)(j) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (L)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (A)(1)(j) of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the
same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the
same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined in R.C.
§ 4510.01 applies to this section.

   (A)   (1)   As used in this section:
         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,

73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A)) (Rev. 2016)
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192) (Rev. 2024)

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end
of the structure.
      (3)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this
section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by the Department and
the existence of such signs shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate

§ 74.54 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-
quarter inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

of two or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L equals the
distance in rounded whole feet between the extreme of any group of two or more
consecutive axles, and N equals the number of axles in the group under
consideration. However, two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross
load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and
last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (B)(9) of this section, the weight
of vehicle and load imposed upon a road surface that is not part of the

            1.   Spaced four feet or less apart, and weighed simultaneously,
24,000 pounds;
            2.   Spaced more than four feet apart, and weighed simultaneously,
34,000 pounds, plus 1,000 pounds per foot or fraction thereof, over four feet,
not to exceed 40,000 pounds.
         (c)   On any three successive load-bearing axles designed to equalize
the load between such axles and spaced so that each such axle of the three-axle
group is more than four feet from the next axle in the three-axle group and so
that the spacing between the first axle and the third axle in the three-axle
group is no more than nine feet, and with such load-bearing three-axle group
weighed simultaneously as a unit:
            1.   A weight of 48,000 pounds, with the total weight of the
vehicle and load not exceeding 38,000 pounds plus an additional 900 pounds for
each foot of spacing between the front axle and the rearmost axle of the
vehicle;
            2.   As an alternative to division (B)(4)(c)1. of this section,

of spacing between the front axle and rearmost axle, with the total weight of
the vehicle and load not exceeding 54,000 pounds plus an additional 600 pounds
per each foot of spacing between the front axle and the rearmost axle of the
vehicle.
         (d)   The total weight of the vehicle and load utilizing any
combination of axles, other than as provided for three-axle groups in division
(B)(4) of this section, shall not exceed 38,000 pounds plus an additional 900

or more consecutive axles whose centers may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than 40 inches but not more than 96
inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.
      (8)   This division (B) does not apply to passenger bus type vehicles
operated by a regional transit authority pursuant to R.C. §§ 306.30 through
306.54.
      (9)   Either division (B)(2) or (B)(4) of this section applies to the
weight of a vehicle and its load imposed upon any road surface that is not a
part of the interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires. As between
divisions (B)(2) and (B)(4) of this section, only the division that yields the
highest total gross vehicle weight limit shall be applied to any such vehicle.
Once that division has been determined, only the limits contained in the
subdivisions of that division shall apply to that vehicle.

      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.

attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, § 90.28(D) and
divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and § 90.36 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and
the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG , DANGEROUS DOG , and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

fined not less than $75 or more than $250 and may be imprisoned for not more

same dog, the court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as
a dangerous dog.

this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(F))

the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at

section that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final

division and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or
restrained in accordance with division (B)(4) of this section or at the county
dog pound at the owner’s expense.

with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that § 90.36 applies with respect to the dog as if
it were a dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall order the

out of the moneys in the treasurer of the municipality not otherwise
appropriated. Such cutting and removing shall be at the owner’s expense and the
costs, together with an administrative fee of 20%, shall be assessed against
the lot or land. Such administrative fee shall not exceed $200. The Fiscal
Officer will invoice the owner or pertinent party and if not paid within 30
days of dated invoice, he or she will prepare documents to have the total
assessed to the property taxes.
   (E)   The Fiscal Officer shall make a written return to the County Auditor
of the action under this chapter with a statement of the charges for their

These amounts, when allowed, shall be entered upon the tax duplicate and are a
lien upon such lands and after the date of entry will be collected as other
taxes and returned to the Village of Anna General Fund.

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish requirements for the use
of rights-of-way in the village. No person shall use any rights-of-way or any
public property within the village for any purpose unless the person conforms
to the requirements set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   This chapter does not take the place of any franchise, license, or
permit which may be additionally required.
   (C)   The Village Administrator is hereby granted the authority and duty of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   The policy of the village with respect to rights-of-way is as follows:
      (1)   To promote public safety and protect public and private property;
      (2)   To promote the best utilization of rights-of-way to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare and to promote economic development in the
village;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the village and right-of-way users in
order to minimize public inconvenience during right-of-way work, and to
minimize uneconomic, unneeded and unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (4)   (a)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses
of rights-of-way and to establish the following priority of use of rights-of-
way when all requested usage of rights-of-way by permittees cannot be
accommodated:
            1.   First priority: use by the village;
            2.   Second priority: use by another governmental entity;
            3.   Third priority: use by franchise holders;
            4.   Fourth priority: use by utilities serving the public but
without a franchise; and
            5.   Sixth priority: use by individuals
         (b)   The Village Administrator may reasonably require users of the
rights-of-way to cooperate to accommodate other users. The Village
Administrator may alter this priority when it is determined a deviation
therefrom to be in the public interest.
      (5)   To protect the value of private property by setting minimum
aesthetic standards for uses of public property;
      (6)   To require underground placement of all facilities in areas with
existing underground facilities;
      (7)   To require the improvement of existing areas to underground
facilities at the user’s expense; and
      (8)   To minimize the impact on existing facilities and/or utilities
including landscaping.

(Ord. 1253-99, passed 5-11-1999) Penalty, see §
95.99
§ 95.05 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   Should any user discontinue use of any facilities in the rights-of-

(Ord. 1253-99, passed 5-11-1999) Penalty, see §
95.99
§ 95.06 VACATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Unless preempted by state or federal law, in the event a right-of-way
or public property used by a user or individual shall be vacated or conveyed to
others by the village, the user or individual shall, at its expense, forthwith
remove its facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted by an easement or
by the property owner to continue the same. Upon the removal thereof, the area

after 30 days written notice by the village to remove the facilities or to
repair, restore, reconstruct, improve, or maintain the vacated area, the
village may do the work or cause it to be done and the cost thereof as found
and declared by the village shall be paid by the user or individual and
collection may be made by any available remedy.

95.99
§ 95.07 REMOVAL OR RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the event it is necessary temporarily to remove or relocate any

temporary removal or relocation of the facilities.
   (B)   In the event it is necessary to permanently remove or relocate any
facilities in the right-of-way in order to accommodate another user, the user
whose facilities need to be removed or relocated shall comply at the expense of
the person requesting the removal or relocation, unless the request is made by
the village in accordance with §

(Ord. 1253-99, passed 5-11-1999) Penalty, see §
95.99
§ 95.08 SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL POLICY.
   (A)   This policy is put in place to allow the Public Works Department to
provide maximum service to all residents in keeping our streets safe.
   (B)   During snow/ice events of two inches or more, vehicles must be moved
to allow for plowing of streets for the safety of residents and others
traveling within the village limits.
   (C)   On the even number day of the month, vehicles may be parked on the
side of the street where building addresses end in an even number, and on the
odd numbered days, the odd side, where parking is lawfully allowed, until the
snow is removed. In this way, within two days the whole street will be plowed
all the way to the curb. Once plowed, vehicles may park on either side.
   (D)   Upon the first violation of this section, the owner will receive a
warning. Upon a second violation, he or she will receive a parking ticket, and
upon a third violation, the vehicle will be towed at the owner’s expense.
   (E)   Ordinance 1545-09 also states that property owners are responsible for
clearing all snow and ice from sidewalks adjacent to their property within 48
hours of the end of the snowfall or precipitation. The Public Works Department
suggests that residents wait until the village plows have pushed back snow to
the curb line before clearing the sidewalk areas. This generally happens after
snow has stopped. It is against the law to plow snow from driveways and
walkways into the road. Remember, residents/property owners are also
responsible for their snow removal contractor's actions.
   (F)   Residents should also keep in mind that snow plows are designed to
remove snow from the roadway to the edge of the road. It is likely that the
plow will leave behind a window of snow in front of driveways. Residents are
responsible for removing this snow.
   (G)   Residents and private plowing contractors should take note that
Ordinance 1545-09 prohibits snow to be placed on any public street/highway in
such a manner as to impede or inconvenience travel on any roadway. Residents or
private contractors will also be held responsible for any curb damage done as a
result of plowing snow across roadways.
   (H)   The Public Works Department also suggests residents make certain their
mailboxes are set according to village guidelines. These guidelines are
available at the Village Hall. The Public Works Department does not replace
mailboxes that are displaced by snow or slush from plows. If contact with a
plow can be shown, then it would be replaced.
   (I)   The Department strongly urges each homeowner to maintain the storm
drain in front of or close to their home, keeping it free and clear of any
leaves or debris causing the drain to become clogged and not drain properly,
which in some cases there would be freezing water and/or flooding. Residents
are also asked to clean around any fire hydrants adjacent to their property.
   (J)   Any violation to these ordinance-enforced items will be prosecuted to
the extent the law allows.
(Ord. 1545-09, passed 10-27-2009; Am. Ord. 1646-13, passed 12-26-2013) Penalty,
see §
95.99
§ 95.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   No user shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of the village to enforce
prompt compliance. However, the village may in individual instances and upon a
written request establishing hardship and for good cause shown, waive, in
writing, any requirement of this chapter.
   (B)   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter, and the
remedy of specific performance which may be enforced, failure to comply with
any provision of this chapter shall be a civil forfeiture, payable to the
village, in the amount of $100 per day for each day of violation.
   (C)   Any user may be excused for violations of this chapter for reasons of
force majeure.
(Ord. 1253-99, passed 5-11-1999)
   (D)   Any violation of this chapter for which there is no specific penalty
shall be subject to §
10.99.

§ 98.01 TREE GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Street trees are important to our quality of life in the village. They
are living elements of our street infrastructure. Located in the public right-
of-way, they provide cooling shade, cleaner air, and a more beautiful urban
landscape. Trees confer important esthetic and ecological benefits to village
residents as well. Yet plants in the urban landscape face a variety of
environmental and physical stresses, including pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, soil compaction, air pollution and drought. Some of the key factors to
maximize long-term plant survival are proper handling, careful planting, and
immediate and continued aftercare. Managing village trees helps to manage
nature in the village while at the same time improving the visual quality of
the landscape.
   (B)   Scientific studies indicate that trees make village life more
enjoyable thereby increasing employment opportunities, expanding economic
growth potential and reducing the cost of energy consumption.

§ 98.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   LARGE TREES. Trees attaining a height of 45 feet or more with a mature
spread of 40 feet or more.
   MEDIUM TREES. Trees attaining a height of 30 to 45 feet with a mature spread
of 30 feet or more.
   PERSON. Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, or
organization of any kind.
   PROPERTY OWNER. The person owning such property as shown on the county
property maps.
   PUBLIC PLACES. Shall include all grounds owned by the village.
   PUBLIC TREES. Shall include all shade and ornamental trees now or hereafter
growing on any street on any public land where otherwise indicated.
   SMALL TREES. Trees attaining a height of 20 to 30 feet with a mature spread
of 20 feet or more.
   STREET or HIGHWAY. The entire width of every public way or right-of-way when
any part thereof is open to the use of the public, as a matter of right, for
purposes of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
   TREE LAWN. The right-of-way edge that is part of a street or highway, not
covered by sidewalk or other paving, lying between the property line and the
edge of the street. It is the area between the sidewalk and the street. If
there is no sidewalk it is the width of the easement or ten feet from the road.
   TREE PIT. An excavated hole or cavity in the ground that forms a chamber or
space into which the tree roots are buried. The pit maybe located in a section
of the sidewalk or pavement cavity. In some instances the pit maybe a raised
concrete structure filled with dirt for tree planting.
(Ord. 1577-11, passed 12-13-2011)
§ 98.03 DUTY.
   The village shall make rules governing the planting, maintenance and removal
of trees in the tree lawns or other public places to ensure safety or preserve
the aesthetics.
(Ord. 1577-11, passed 12-13-2011)
§ 98.04 DESIGN.
   (A)   Spacing requirements. The following guidelines shall be observed when
placing trees along sidewalks or in tree lawns.
      (1)   Do not plant in front of building entrances in order to permit easy
access by the Fire Department.
      (2)   Minimum distance between trees (center to center) ranges from 20
feet to 30 feet, depending upon the tree species and other local conditions.
      (3)   Minimum distance from a streetlight is 25 feet (varies with tree
species).
      (4)   Minimum distance from a stop sign is 30 feet.
      (5)   Minimum distance from other traffic signs is six feet.
      (6)   Minimum distance from a gas or water valve is two feet.
      (7)   Minimum distance from a fire hydrant is five feet.
      (8)   Minimum distance from a curb cut or driveway is seven feet.
      (9)   Small trees may only be planted under utility lines.
   (B)   Tree pit configuration. Tree pits should be as large as possible to
allow for ample growing space for tree roots and crown. Optimal tree pit size
would be four or five feet by ten feet. The overall width of a sidewalk can
limit the size of the tree pit.
   (C)   Grouped plantings.  
      (1)   Grouped plantings are encouraged due to the benefits of trees in
close proximity. These benefits include increased shading, less
evapotranspiration, less soil compaction, greater shared soil volume, and less
reflective heat absorbed by a single tree. A grouped planting can be achieved
in several types of sites:
         (a)   A green street, such as a median or traffic triangle, with the
opportunity for a large planting bed.
         (b)   A continuous tree pit, where two or more trees are planted in a
single trench in the sidewalk (at least 30 feet long).
         (c)   A raised planting bed within a plaza or alongside a pedestrian
passageway.
      (2)   Species selection is very important in grouped plantings. Tolerant
species are strongly recommended and monoculture plantings are discouraged. Low
maintenance cost and low replacement costs are two advantages of planting
tolerant species in grouped configurations.
   (D)   Species selection. Growing conditions and microclimates can vary from
location to location within a village. Final tree variety selection is
determined by site conditions. The right tree for the right site is a must.

98.99
§ 98.05 PERMITS.

tunnels, trenches, or lay any drive within a radius of ten feet from any public
tree without first obtaining a written permit from the Village Administrator.
      (3)   New subdivisions and commercial areas will require tree plantings

public place of the municipality, any stone, brick, sand, concrete, or other
materials which may impede the free passage of water, air, and fertilizer to

(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.15 THE FRANCHISING PROCESS.
   In order to provide for public participation in franchise selection and to
assure fundamentals of due process, the village hereby adopts the following
franchise selection process.
   (A)   Council shall itself serve as the village’s franchising authority.
   (B)   Council shall conduct the franchisee selection process herein
described and, after fully considering the evidence presented and the best
interests of the village, select cable television franchisees.
   (C)   Whenever any new system is proposed, or whenever the Council
determines that the village is being inadequately serviced with cable
television, Council shall invite applications for a CATV franchise with the
village and give adequate public notice thereof.
   (D)   Whenever an existing franchise expires, a succeeding franchise shall
be designated a renewal franchise regardless of any changes in the provisions
of the franchise agreement. An existing franchisee shall be eligible to apply
for the renewal franchise. Other competing applicants will also be permitted to
apply for the renewal franchise at the same time and considered along with the
existing franchisee.
   (E)   Council shall place all franchise applications on public file,
available at reasonable times in the village administration office.
   (F)   Council shall give public notice of all filings, so that the village’s
citizens may familiarize themselves with the franchise applicants and
intelligently engage in the franchise selection process.
   (G)   At a reasonable time in advance of any proposed public hearings,
Council shall publicly give adequate notice thereof.
   (H)   At a convenient time and place, Council will then conduct a public
proceeding, at which all interested persons shall be afforded the opportunity
of testifying as to the qualifications of the various franchise applicants.
   (I)   At the public proceeding, Council shall examine, among other factors,
the applicants’ legal, character, financial, and technical qualifications as
well as the adequacy and feasibility of their construction arrangements.
   (J)   Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the public
proceedings, Council shall review the evidence presented and select a
franchisee.
      (1)   In the case of a new franchise, the Council will select that
applicant which is best qualified to meet the needs of the village and make a
public report setting forth the basis for its selection. The selection shall
not be based solely on which applicant offers the lower subscriber rates, but
shall take into account all the characteristics and qualifications of the
applicant listed in division (I) above of this section and may further take
into account the reputation, the record of performance and the financial
results an applicant may have developed in operating CATV systems in various
communities.
      (2)   In the case of a renewal of an existing franchise, the existing
franchisee shall be selected over competing applicants if the existing
franchisee:
         (a)   Demonstrates that he or she possesses the requisite legal,
character, financial and technical qualifications;
         (b)   Establishes at the public hearing that during the preceding
franchise term its record of performance has been satisfactory and its program
service has been substantially attuned to meeting the needs and interest of the
area; and
         (c)   Satisfies the franchising authority that it will provide at
competitive rates a quality of service and programming substantially equal or
better than that available to the village from other cablevision companies.
   (K)   Finally, Council shall enter into a non-exclusive cable television
franchise agreement, the terms of which shall comply in all substantial regards
with the provisions of this chapter, as well as any amendments thereto.
Provided, however, that any individual franchise may include additional terms,
not otherwise in conflict with FCC rules or the express mandates of this
chapter.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.16 FRANCHISE RECORD AND ACCOUNT KEEPING.
   (A)   (1)   Any company selected hereunder as a cable television franchisee
shall designate a depository within the Village of Anna for the payment of
subscription charges and shall further maintain a toll free telephone number
and a regional office for the handling of inquiries and service complaints.
      (2)   The company is further required to establish and maintain a
separate section of accounts and record keeping for that portion of its system
operative:
         (a)   Within the village limits; and
         (b)   Contiguous areas surrounding the village.
      (3)   The village may require that the company file separate certified
financial statements for the franchisee’s Anna activities.
   (B)   The company shall maintain an accurate and current record of all
service complaints it has received, including its disposition thereof, and
shall retain for inspection by the village all responses received from the
annual customer inquiry conducted pursuant to §
113.18 of this chapter.
   (C)   The company shall file with the Village Council a copy of any
additional documents or reports which it may judge relevant to the village’s

other documents and information as the Council may reasonably request.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.17 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICES.
   Whenever, by the terms of this chapter or any franchise agreement, the
village is required to give notice to the company, the notice shall be given in
writing addressed to the company’s designated manager and delivered to the
principal office of the company in the village. Whenever the company is
required to give notice to the village, the notice shall be given in writing
and addressed to the Village Fiscal Officer and delivered to the administration
office during ordinary business hours.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.18 SERVICE COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any company selected as a franchisee hereunder shall designate to the
public a representative, who will be available at the company’s regional office
at reasonable hours, and who will be authorized to answer, and make adjustments
in response to, all service complaints, including quality of service and
equipment malfunctions. If attempts at settling the subscriber-company dispute
fail at the representative level, the complainant may petition to Village
Council for the appointment of a three member arbitration board. The
arbitration board will be comprised of one member selected by Council, one
member selected by the company, and a third member selected by, and mutually
agreeable to, the other two members. The arbitration board thus empaneled will
be authorized to hear testimony in an orderly and fair manner from both sides
to the controversy and render final judgment thereof. Provided, however, that
no judgment rendered by the arbitration board be constructed as precluding an
otherwise actionable controversy in a court of law of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   At least annually, the company shall solicit comments from its
subscribers regarding local programming, the technical equality of its service,
and other CATV related topics as Council may request.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.19 RATE STRUCTURE AND FRANCHISE AGREEMENT STANDARDS.
   Any franchise agreement entered into between the village and the company
shall contain specific provisions which are consistent with the following
requirements.
   (A)   The franchise term shall be of reasonable duration, not in excess of
15 years.
   (B)   The franchise fee charged by the village shall be reasonable and not
in excess of 3% of the franchisee’s annual gross subscriber revenues from cable
television operations in the community, including all forms of consideration as
the initial lump-sum payments.
   (C)   GROSS SUBSCRIBER REVENUES shall be defined as including any and all
compensation or receipts derived by franchisee from installation, disconnection
and re-installation charges and periodic service charges in connection with the
carriage of broadcast signals and Federal Communications Commission mandated
nonbroadcast services within the village, but shall not include any refunds or
credits made to subscribers or any taxes imposed upon the services furnished by
grantee.
   (D)   The subscription rate structure shall be fair and equitable to all
classes of service without unreasonable discrimination. Before any subscription
rate structure shall become effective (either the initial rate structure or any
subsequent amendment thereto), it shall first be approved by Council after
conducting appropriate public proceedings.
   (E)   At the end of the fifth and the tenth years of any existing franchise
term, the Council and its franchisee shall review as a matter of course, the
existing rate structure and either approve its continuance or make the
appropriate adjustments as may appear necessary to arriving at a figure which
is reasonable and fair to all parties. No adjustments in rate structure shall
be made without specific action of Council. The foregoing five-year review
periods shall not be construed to prevent the franchisee from petitioning the
Council for a change of subscription rates, upon a showing of cause.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.20 POLE LINE REGULATIONS.
   Any company selected hereunder shall furnish the village, at least annual
maps or prints showing the pole line system in sufficient detail to assess the
village of being currently advised as to the location of the cables of the
system. It shall be the responsibility of the company to keep the village
advised of any material changes and additions and removals in the system except
for the individual subscriber’s connection wires. Wherever within the village,
other wire carriers such as telephone and electric utilities are compelled,
required or elect to place the wires underground the company shall also place
its wire facilities underground. No poles or towers shall be installed by the
company on village streets, alleys, or public ways except the poles as may be
necessary due to the fact that the pole spacing of either the electrical or
telephone utility makes it impractical to use same. In an event, the company
may set an intervening additional pole within the normal spacing of the
electric or telephone utility’s pole line, providing specific written approval
shall first be obtained from the Village Council as to actual need. In no event
shall the absence of a pole line agreement be regarded as justification for
installing poles or towers.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.21 MANNER OF TERMINATION.
   (A)   The village reserves the right to revoke the rights of any franchisee
granted hereunder if the company fails, after 60 days written notice, to comply
with the conditions, provisions or regulations under this chapter, or the terms
of its franchise agreement. The company at any time during the effective period
of this chapter may terminate its agreement hereunder upon giving of this
chapter 90 days written notice of the termination, provided that the company
pay the village, within 30 days of the effective date of the termination, all
sums due the village under the provisions of its franchise.
   (B)   (1)   Upon the termination for cause as provided by this chapter, the
village, at its election, and upon payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to
the fair market value of the physical property of the system, shall have the
right to purchase and take over the CATV system in its entirety.
      (2)   Upon expiration of the term of any franchise granted hereunder, or
upon receipt of an application for franchise transfer approval as set forth in
§
113.14, the village, at its election, and upon payment to the franchisee of a
sum equal to the fair market value of the physical property of the system,
shall have the right to purchase and take over the CATV system in its entirety.
      (3)   In the foregoing divisions (1) and (2) above, any sum payable by
the village for net book value or fair market value shall in no event include
and the franchisee shall not receive anything for the valuation of good will or
of any right to privilege appertaining to it under its franchise. Upon exercise
of either of these options by the village and its service of an official notice
of the action upon the franchisee, and upon payment of the purchase price, the
franchisee shall immediately transfer to the village possession and title to
all facilities and property, real and personal, of the CATV business, free from
any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the village in
lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the franchisee
shall execute the warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the
village as shall be necessary for this purpose.
   (C)   In order that the village may exercise its option to take over the
facilities and property of the system as herein provided, the franchisee shall
not make, execute, or enter into any deed, deed of trust mortgage, contract,
conditional sales contract, or any loan, lease pledge, sale, gift, pole
agreement, or any other agreement concerning any of its facilities or property,
real or personal, without prior approval of the Village Council, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.
(Ord. 742-80, passed 12-9-1980)
§ 113.22 SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION.
   The village shall have the right to supervise all construction or
installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter and any
franchise granted hereunder and to make the inspections as it shall find
necessary to insure compliance with the governing ordinances, and the terms of
the franchise agreement.

   (A)   Not sooner than 45 nor later than 60 days after the end of each
calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service provider
fee to the village. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining the

determined by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service
provider under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from
dividing the number of subscribers in the village by the total number of
regional or national subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under
the contract or arrangement.
      (2)   Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:

bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of

advertising, and electronic publishing;

section.

operator under a franchise agreement which is in effect in the village, the
percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video
service provider to the village shall be the same percentage of gross revenue
payable in that calendar quarter pursuant to that franchise agreement, not to
exceed 5%.
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be 3% of a video service provider's
gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the village.
   (E)   (1)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar

verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to village in the audit period. For the purpose
of the audit, the video service provider shall make available for inspection,
at the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business,

of this §
114.02.

underpaid in the audit within 30 days after notice and shall include interest
on the underpayments. However, payment need not be made in that 30-day period
if the video service provider brings an action under division (3) of this
section.
      (3)   An action by the village or by the video service provider to
dispute the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results
may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction not later than two years

         OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC
SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §

in this division (C)(2).
         PUBLIC SERVANT. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is

the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (Rev. 2016)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (Rev. 2016)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (Rev. 2013)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (Rev. 1999)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) (Rev. 1999)
Statutory reference:
Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05) (Rev. 2022)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08) (Rev. 2017)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.

2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under

court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22) (Rev. 2024)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41) (Rev. 2013)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27) (Rev. 2001)
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09) (Rev. 2022)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21) (Rev. 2005)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24) (Rev. 2024)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25) (Rev. 2024)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26) (Rev. 2015)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:

         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27) (Rev. 2012)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 through 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28) (Rev. 2024)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

of all property or services involved in the offense.

2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

§ 131.20 DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

her parents, her guardian, or her custodian, or about the last known address of
either of her parents, her guardian, her custodian, or a specified brother,
sister, stepparent, or grandparent to whom she requested notice be given and
the person who performed or induced the abortion did not otherwise have
reasonable cause to believe the pregnant woman was under 18 years of age,
unmarried, or unemancipated, to believe that the age of the brother or sister
to whom she requested notice be given as a specified relative instead of one of
her parents, her guardian, or her custodian was not 21 years of age, or to

immediate threat of serious risk to the life or physical health of the pregnant
woman or pregnant minor from the continuation of her pregnancy created an
emergency necessitating the immediate performance or inducement of an abortion.

physician’s good faith medical judgment, that the unborn child is not viable,
and the physician makes that determination after performing a medical
examination of the pregnant woman and after performing or causing to be
performed those tests for assessing gestational age, weight, lung maturity, or
other tests that the physician, in that physician’s good faith medical
judgment, believes are necessary to determine whether an unborn child is

the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this chapter,
R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the possession of
chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance
included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report from the Bureau
or from any laboratory that is operated or established as described in this
division that is signed by the person performing the analysis, stating that the
substances that are the basis of the alleged offense have been weighed and
analyzed and stating the findings as to the content, weight, and identity of
each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and

      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (C)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The

portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice, or, if the
accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court,
present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

   In order that the village has the assurance that the construction and
installation of improvements such as street surfacing, curbs, gutters, storm
sewers and appurtenances, sanitary sewer, waterlines, sidewalks, street
lighting, street signs and other required improvements will be constructed, the
subdivider shall provide performance surety.
   (A)   Performance surety.
      (1)   The subdivider shall furnish either a bond, executed by a surety
company, cash deposit (certified or cashier’s check) or irrevocable letter of
credit (form must be approved by the Village Solicitor) equal to the cost of
construction of improvements as shown on the plans, and based on a detailed,
itemized estimate approved by the Village Administrator. The estimate shall
reflect consideration of prevailing wage requirements.
      (2)   The performance bond, cash deposit (certified or cashier’s check)
or irrevocable letter of credit to the Village of Anna shall run for a period
of one year and be extendable for two years from the date of execution, and

agent or servants, will comply with all applicable terms, conditions,
provisions, and requirements of these regulations, and will faithfully perform
and complete the work of constructing and installing the facilities or
improvements in accordance with the laws and regulations. Before the bond is
accepted it shall be approved by the Village Solicitor. Whenever a cash deposit
(certified or cashier’s check) is made, the same shall be made out to the
Village of Anna.
   (B)   Extension of time. If the construction or installation of any
improvement or facility, for which guarantee has been made by the developer in
the form of bond or cash deposit, is not completed within two years from the

Village of Anna to grant an extension, provided he or she can show reasonable
cause can be shown for inability to complete the improvements within the
required two years.
   (C)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance

made by the Village of Anna to ensure conformity with the approved plans and
specifications as required by these regulations.
   (B)   The subdivider shall notify proper village officials at least 24 hours
before each phase of the improvements is ready for inspection. The presence
and/or absence of an inspector during construction shall not relieve the
subdivider from full responsibility of required improvements to the Village of
Anna Construction Standards and Drawings and to the satisfaction of the Village
of Anna. See Village of Anna Design Criteria for inspection requirements. The
village will require improvement inspection fees (see §

subdivider shall post with the village a maintenance surety in the amount of
10% of the performance surety and in a form as approved by the Village
Solicitor.
   (B)   No public improvements shall be approved until the subdivider has
posted an approved maintenance surety, and this maintenance surety will extend
for one year from the actual date that the final punch list has been completed
and approved by the village.
   (C)   Acceptance by the village of the public improvements will not take
place until the village releases the maintenance surety and receives as-built
plans, as outlined in the Village of Anna Design Criteria, of construction
plans, including all utilities (i.e. sanitary sewer, storm sewer, gas, water).
As-built plans shall be stamped by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor verifying the accuracy of the drawings.

approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   (B)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to defer
the construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible
grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for
other reasons, the applicant shall pay his or her share of the costs of the
future improvements as approved by the Zoning Administrator and Council to the
Village of Anna prior to signing of the final subdivision plat.

these regulations has not been completed within the two-year time period agreed
upon in the subdivider’s contract with the village, and the subdivider has
failed to establish reasonable cause for the delay to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Administrator and thereby to receive a time extension; or
   (B)   The subdivider has not constructed the required public improvements in
accordance with the minimum standards specified in these regulations, and the
subdivider is unwilling to modify and/or upgrade the public improvements within
a six-month time period after receiving notice from the Zoning Administrator so
as to be in compliance with the provisions of these regulations.

   The subdivider shall be in default of the maintenance surety when the
required public improvements have not been properly maintained over the one-
year period as established in §
152.090, Improvements and Performance Surety or when the required public
improvements are not in accordance with the “as-built” plans submitted by the
subdivider to the village. The same shall apply whenever construction of
improvements is not performed in accordance with applicable standards and
specifications. In cases of default, the village shall proceed to utilize the
performance surety and/or maintenance surety to construct the required public
improvements to the minimum design standards as required in these regulations.

§ 152.110 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (A)   The regulations contained in this section and the Village of Anna
Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings shall control the
manner in which streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged
on the land. These design controls shall help ensure convenient and safe
streets, creation of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities, and
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned, haphazard growth.
   (B)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility of reviewing the design
of each future subdivision early in its design development. The Planning
Commission shall ensure that all the requirements of this section and the
Village of Anna Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings are
met.
(Ord. passed 1-12-1999)
§ 152.111 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangements, character, width, and location of all arterial and
collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the adopted
Village of Anna Comprehensive Development Plan. Lack of a Comprehensive
Development and thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned plan shall
conform to the recommendation of the Planning Commission, based upon these
regulations. In addition, no final plat shall be approved if in conflict with
an existing ordinance.

§ 152.112 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage,
topography, inadequate water supply and other conditions which may endanger
health, life, or property; and if from investigations conducted by the public
agencies concerned it is determined that in the best interest of the public the
land should not be developed for the desired purpose, the Planning Commission
shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced
by the subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the
development of the land.
(Ord. passed 1-12-1999)
§ 152.113 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, construction, and
location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan of
the village, and shall conform to the Village of Anna Design Criteria and
Construction Standards and Drawings. Street design shall take into
consideration their relationship to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, and public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by the streets. The street
pattern shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The
subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the plat, the necessary
right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or alignment of the streets in
conformity with the Comprehensive Development Plan.
   (B)   The subdivider shall improve all streets which are part of the
subdivision, including that portion of the subdivision located on existing
streets. The required improvements shall be so that all items of work are in
accordance with the Village of Anna Design Criteria and Construction Standards
and Drawings. Existing streets shall be improved so that they meet the above
standards including storm drainage.
   (C)   Curbs and gutters shall be required for all streets including existing
streets.
   (D)   Appropriate access to and from any subdivision in the form of a
standard village street with required improvements must be provided by a
developer in instances where development is not located contiguously along an
improved public street right-of-way. No subdivision shall be approved where a
parcel, tract or lot has frontage only on the “stub end” of a discontinued or
dead-end street. The street must first be extended or reconstructed as a cul-
de-sac in accordance with these regulations. No subdivision showing reserved
strips controlling the access to public ways will be approved.
   (E)   All street widths shall conform to the Village of Anna Design Criteria
and Construction Standards and Drawings. In cases where the designation of the
street is in question, the Planning Commission shall determine the type of
street designation.
(Ord. passed 1-12-1999) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.114 STREET SIGNS AND STREET NAMES.

signs plus 15% to cover labor cost.
   (B)   For purposes of street naming, the following is recommended.
   (1)   Circle, Place, or Court should be used only for cul-de-sac type
streets.
   (2)   The words north, south, east, or west should be avoided as part of a
street name whenever possible.
   (C)   Whenever a new street is constructed along the approximate alignment
or extension of an existing street, its name shall be the same as that of the
existing one.

§ 153.004 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSES.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of these regulations, they shall

law or ordinance or any rules or regulations previously adopted or issued or
which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of
buildings or premises. Where these regulations impose a greater restriction
upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings or

§ 153.005 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.

§ 153.006 RULES FOR OFFICIAL ZONING DISTRICT MAP INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   It is the intent of these regulations that the entire area under the

districts established by these regulations.
   (B)   When definite distances in feet are not shown on the official zoning
district map, the district boundaries on the official zoning district map are
intended to be along the centers of existing streets or alleys, or along

line is not clear, it shall be determined by either supplemental detail
drawings or by rules of interpretation adopted by the concurring vote of a
majority of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (C)   When the streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or
alleys shown on the official zoning district map, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may apply the district designations on the map to the property on the ground in
a manner as to conform to the intent and purposes of this section in the
judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

§ 153.009 REGULATIONS NOT RETROACTIVE.
   Except as otherwise specified in these regulations, any use, lot, building
or structure that exists as of the enactment date of these regulations, or any
amendment thereof, may be continued even though the use, lot, building or
structure may not conform to the provisions of the zoning district where it is
located. The provisions for nonconforming uses shall apply.
(Ord. 1227-98, passed 1-12-1999)
§ 153.010 REGULATION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures include uses, buildings,
or structures that were lawfully existing prior to the adoption of these
regulations, or any amendment thereto and which are prohibited or further
restricted as a result of the provisions adopted in these regulations.
   (B)   (1)   A nonconforming use, building, or structure may be changed to
another nonconforming use, building, or structure only by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit substitution of a new
nonconforming use, building, or structure in place of an existing nonconforming
use, building, or structure provided the Board of Zoning Appeals determines
that any changes will be less detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing
use.
   (C)   Any nonconforming use of land that is discontinued for a period of 12
months or more, shall not thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use.
   (D)   Any nonconforming use superseded by a permitted use within the zoning
district where it is located shall thereafter be in conformance with these
regulations, and the previous nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
   (E)   No nonconforming use, building, or structure shall be enlarged,
extended, reconstructed or structurally altered except as pursuant to the
provisions of these regulations.
   (F)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless the building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
zoning district in which the building or structures are to be located.
   (G)   Any nonconforming building or use of land destroyed by natural causes
(fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, or the like) to the extent of more than 60%
of its replacement value shall not be resumed or reconstructed. The remains of
any building or structure shall be razed as soon as possible. Any subsequent
use of the land shall be in conformance with these regulations. Replacement
value shall be based upon the reproduction cost of the building, structure or
use prior to the calamity and determined by the Zoning Administrator. In case
of any uncertainty about the replacement value of a particular building,
structure or use, the determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals or their
designated representative shall be final.

§ 153.011 RESERVED.
§ 153.012 ESSENTIAL SERVICES.
   (A)   Public utilities, facilities, and structures shall be classified
either as primary utilities or secondary utilities. The term public means the
utility serves more than one lot or customer.
   (B)   Primary utilities include facilities and structures which, due to
their relatively large size, height, noise of operation, generation of odors,
or other factors, could disrupt or diminish the use or enjoyment of surrounding
properties. Primary utilities typically include the source of generation or the
final destination of the utility which can stand apart from the individual
customers or lots which it serves and is typically distributed by secondary
utilities. Primary utilities include, but are not limited to, wastewater
treatment plants, water treatment plants, water towers, electrical substations,
electrical generating facilities, telecommunications towers, and any facility
of a height greater than 45 feet (except for utility poles and flag poles) or a
size greater than 500 square feet.
   (C)   Secondary utilities include facilities and structures, which, due to
their relatively small size, are unobtrusive and do not typically disrupt the
use or enjoyment of surrounding properties. Secondary utilities typically
include the distribution system of the utility, which must be in direct contact
with or in the immediate vicinity of the customers or lots which it serves, and
is fed by or feeds to the primary utility. Secondary utilities include, but are
not limited to, distribution structures such as pipes and wires, small
structures such as hydrants, valves, electrical boxes, and utility poles of 45
feet in height or less.
   (D)   The location, erection, construction, reconstruction, change,
alteration, maintenance, removal, use or enlargement of any building or
structure of any secondary utility shall be permitted in any zoning district
provided every effort is made to protect the character and general welfare of
the zoning district.
   (E)   The location, erection, construction, reconstruction, change,
alteration, maintenance, removal, use, or enlargement of any primary utility
shall be in conformance with the requirements of the zoning district in which
it is located.

153.999
§ 153.013 INVALIDITY OF A PART.
   If any chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase
of these regulations is declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any
court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree, the
unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the constitutionality or
validity of the remaining chapters, sections, subsections, paragraphs,
sentences, clauses or phrases of these regulations since the same would have
been enacted without the unconstitutional or invalid chapter, section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrases.
(Ord. 1227-98, passed 1-12-1999)
§ 153.014 APPLICABILITY.
   These regulations shall apply to all land, every structure and every use of
land or structures except for those uses specifically mentioned in §
153.010, as required by the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 1227-98, passed 1-12-1999)
§ 153.015 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Street frontage required. All lots created after the adoption of these
regulations shall have frontage on a dedicated street of 50 feet.
   (B)   Sight triangle. A sight triangle, defined as that area from the
intersection point of two street rights-of-way on the lot to a point 20 feet
back from this intersection point on the lot lines, shall be required on corner
lots at all street intersections in all districts. Visibility between two and
ten feet above the plane of established grades of the street within the sight
triangle shall be clear of landscape materials, vehicles, fences, signs,
parking, or any other view-obstructing structures with the exception of
required traffic control devices, and utility poles. Trees shall be permitted
in the sight triangle as long as only the trunk is visible within ten feet
above the ground, except during early growing stages. In the event street
corners are of the radius type, then the rights-of-way shall be projected to a
point that they intersect. This point shall be referred to as the intersection
point.
   (C)   Unsafe buildings. Nothing in these regulations shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building or
structure.
   (D)   Height limitation exceptions. The height limits of these regulations
shall not apply to projections such as antennae, aerials, steeples, chimneys,
flagpoles, and the like that are attached to a structure, provided the height
of the projection is less than 20 feet above the highest point of the structure
to which it is attached.
   (E)   Annexed land. When land is annexed to the Village of Anna, the
applicable township zoning regulations then in effect shall remain in full
force and shall be enforced by the township officials until a time as the
village shall approve a zoning district for the annexed land.
   (F)   Vacation of public right-of-way. Whenever any street, alley, railroad
right-of-way, or other public right-of-way is vacated by official action of the
Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of the street, alley, railroad
right-of-way, or other public right-of-way shall be automatically extended to
the center of the vacation and all area included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining district, or district nearest
the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all the vacated
area.

   (C)   Final plan.
      (1)   The final Planned Unit Development plan shall conform substantially
to the preliminary plan as approved and shall be filed within six months after
approval of the preliminary plan. If desired by the developer, the final plan
may be submitted in stages, with each stage reflecting a portion of the
approved preliminary plan, which is proposed to be recorded and developed,
provided that the portion conforms to all the requirements of this chapter.

a whole, indicating sub-areas for phased development, if any; the location and
use of structures and portions of structures in relation to building site
lines; building sites reserved for future use and uses for which sites are
reserved; automotive and pedestrian circulatory networks; principal parking
areas; open space not in building sites and the use for which this open space

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS
§ 153.115 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.

shall be provided on the basis of that enlargement only.
      (3)   Major changes. Whenever a building or structure is enlarged to the
extent of 50% or more in floor area, the entire building or structure,

requirements.
   (B)   Location of parking and loading spaces.
      (1)   Location. Off-street parking and loading spaces required by this

         (a)   No parking or loading spaces shall be allowed in any yard in a
residential district. Parking in a commercial or industrial district shall be
allowed in any paved yard but if in the front yard, the setback requirement is

fraction up to and including 1/2 shall be disregarded and any fraction over 1/
2 shall require one additional parking/loading space.
      (2)   Mixed occupancies and uses not specified. In the case of mixed
uses, the total requirement for off-street parking/loading facilities shall be

case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-street
parking/loading facilities shall apply for a use which is mentioned and to
which the use is similar, subject to approval of the Zoning Administrator.
However, no required loading spaces may be used to satisfy the area
requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street
parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading
facilities.
      (3)   Joint parking. Provision of off-street parking/loading facilities
to be shared by two or more buildings or uses is permitted as a conditional

the access drive shall be located in the same zoning district as the property
it serves.
      (3)   Drainage. All required parking/loading areas shall be provided with
adequate drainage facilities in order to ensure that storm water does not flow
onto adjoining property or adjoining sidewalks in a way or quantity that
adjoining property owners or users of the sidewalks would be unreasonably
affected or inconvenienced.
      (4)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking/
loading areas shall be installed or shielded to prevent glare and illumination

      (5)   Time limit. If a zoning permit is issued for the purpose of
constructing a new building or structure or an addition to an existing building
or structure and the construction is not begun within a six month time period,
or the construction is not substantially completed within a 12 month time
period, then the zoning permit shall be null and void unless otherwise approved
by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (6)   Extension of time limit. Should construction of an improvement for
which the required zoning permit was legally granted have begun within six
months of the effective date of these regulations, but due to circumstances

to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator, the zoning permit shall be

   (C)   Variance.
      (1)   On a particular property, exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape, topographic conditions or extraordinary situations or circumstances may
exist, making a strict enforcement of the requirements of the zoning
regulations unreasonable. Under these circumstances the Board of Appeals may
grant a variance from these requirements to provide the flexibility necessary
to adapt to changed or unusual conditions under circumstances which do not
ordinarily involve a change of the use of the land or structure permitted. No
variance shall be granted unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that all of

question are peculiar to the lot or property and do not apply generally to
other land or buildings in the vicinity;

impair the intent of these regulations nor confer on the applicant any special
privilege that is denied to other lands or structures in the same zoning
district; and
         (c)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
health or safety of persons residing or working in the vicinity of the proposed
development, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
private property or public improvements in the vicinity.

resubmitted for consideration for a minimum of two years from the date of
denial, unless the request is substantially changed from the original request
and so may be considered a new request.
   (D)   Conditional use permit.
      (1)   Granting of permit. The Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized to
grant a conditional use permit to those uses listed as conditional uses, to
uses sufficiently similar to those listed uses as to be considered conditional
uses, or to allow more than one type of use per lot. The Board shall consider
