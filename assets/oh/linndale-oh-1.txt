EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

      (3)    A.   The time within which an act is required by law to be done
shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except
that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be
done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may

   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

deterioration of materials, lack of repair or maintenance, is or will become a
hazard to the health, safety or welfare of its occupants or the public or is or
will become a blighting or deteriorating factor in the neighborhood, or will
impair or adversely affect the value of neighboring property, the Director may
declare such property or structure to be a nuisance, issue a notice declaring
the existence of such nuisance, and order the abatement of the nuisance or
proceed to abate the nuisance.
   (c)    An occupied dwelling structure, which is determined by the Director
to be in violation of Section 1411.29 of the Housing Code, is hereby declared
to be a public nuisance.
   (d)   The existence of grass, weeds or other landscaping conditions that
violate the provisions of the Housing Code shall be considered a nuisance. If a
warning notice is sent to a property owner, as provided in this Chapter, in any
calendar year, either before or after such a nuisance is found to exist on a
property, the Director may cause any such nuisance found during that calendar
year to be abated or removed by the Village as conditions may require, without
further notice or warning.
   (e)   The existence of roots of trees that obstruct sewers shall be
considered a nuisance, and if such condition is found, the Director may abate
the nuisance immediately and without service of notice or estimate of the cost
of the abatement.
   (f)   If the Director determines to take action to abate the nuisances
described in subsections (d) or (e) of this Section, the Director shall furnish
the owner of the real estate from which the nuisance originates with a
statement of the estimated cost of abating the same prior to the abatement, and
a statement of the final cost as soon as the cost can be ascertained, and shall
order the owner to pay the cost within such reasonable time as the Director
shall fix. The Director shall collect such costs as set forth in this Chapter.
The Village may assess the real estate at any time after the Village incurs the
costs of preparing to abate and/or abating the nuisance.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-20-24.)
107.04 NOTICE AND SERVICE.
   (a)   A written notice of a nuisance or order to abate shall be served on
the owner, agent, lessee, or party in control of the property. The notice or
order shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, a reasonable time determined
by the Director within which the person shall abate the nuisance, and the
statement that unless the nuisance is abated within the stated time the Village
may prosecute the owner, agent, lessee or party in control for failure to
comply with the order of the Director, or may seek an order of a court
requiring the abatement of the nuisance by such person.
   (b)   In addition to or in lieu of the procedure in subsection (a) of this
Section, the Director may cause a written notice and order to be served on the
owner or the agent of the owner of the property setting forth the nature of the
nuisance, the estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by the Village,
a reasonable time determined by the Director within which the owner shall abate
the nuisance or pay the estimated cost to the Village, and the statement that
unless the nuisance is abated within the stated time it may be abated by the
Village and the cost of abatement assessed on the real estate involved.
   (c)   A notice or order shall be served by delivering it personally, leaving
it at the person's usual place of business or residence, by posting it in a
conspicuous place on the real estate involved, or by mailing it to the person,
or notice may be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Village if it cannot be served in any of the other ways above mentioned. (Ord.
2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.05 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE; COLLECTION OF COSTS; ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   If the nuisance is not abated within the required time, the Director
may cause its abatement. The abatement of a nuisance may be conducted utilizing
labor and materials provided by the Public Works Department, other departments
of the Village, or by entering into a contract for the provision of abatement
services in accordance with the ordinances and Charter of the Village.
   (b)   The Village may take such action as it deems necessary to collect the
costs incurred by the Village in preparing to abate and/or in abating the
nuisance, including the assessment of such costs on the real estate on which
the nuisance existed or the cause or source thereof was located.
   (c)   Regardless of the estimated cost of abating a public nuisance by the
Village as determined herein, the owner or agent shall be responsible for
payment to the Village of the actual costs incurred by the Village in preparing
to abate the nuisance if the Village does not proceed with the abatement or in
preparing to abate and abating the nuisance, plus the Village's actual
administrative costs applied as a percentage of the total cost incurred by the
Village, as approved annually by the Director of Finance. Should the Village's
actual costs in abating such nuisance be less than the estimate, and the owner
has paid to the Village an amount equal to such estimated amount, then the
Village shall refund to the owner the amount of the difference.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.06 ABATEMENT ON VILLAGE PROPERTY.
   When the cause or source of a nuisance exists on property owned by the
Village the Director may abate the nuisance at the expense of the Village, and
no notice shall be required preliminary to the abatement.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
   
107.07 VACANT AND ABANDONED STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Definitions:
      (1)   "Vacant": A structure shall be considered "vacant" for the purposes
of this Chapter if it has not been occupied for a period of six (6) consecutive
months or more, except a structure shall not be considered vacant if it is only
seasonally not occupied and such period is less than twelve (12) months. A
structure shall be considered "vacant" for the purpose of this Chapter even if
it is being maintained on the exterior, and even if the owner of the property
is actively attempting to sell or rent the property.
      (2)   "Abandoned": An "abandoned" structure is a structure that is not
occupied for any period of time during which the Village has not been able to
communicate with or locate an owner or party with the legal authority to be in
control of the property, and after the Village has made reasonable attempts to
communicate with or locate the owner or a party in control.
      (3)   "Occupied": The term "occupied" shall mean the presence of a person
or persons either:
         A.   Living in a structure and using some portion of such structure as
a dwelling unit, as defined in the Housing Code of the Village, or
         B.   Working in a structure and using some portion of the structure
for the operation of a business.
      (4)   "Property": The term "property" shall mean all portions of the real
estate of a parcel in the Village, including lands and structures of every
type.
 
    (b)   Any property that contains a structure that is vacant or abandoned
shall be considered a nuisance unless and until the owner, agent, lessee or
party in control of the property shall, at minimum, take all actions required
in this Section. The exterior of a vacant or abandoned structure, including the
property and structure, shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the Village, and the interior shall be maintained in a safe,
secure and preserved manner to prevent and abate any threat to the health or
safety of the public or anyone entering the structure, and to prevent and abate
any threat of fire or health violation, or to its structural or historical
integrity. The structure shall be winterized to prevent the freezing of pipes,
and all points of entry shall be kept locked and secure. Sufficient property
and liability insurance shall be maintained covering the property up to an
amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property. The Village
shall provide the insurance carrier, if known, and any lien holder of record
for the property with written notice of the requirements of this Section and
that the property is considered a vacant or abandoned structure. The Village
may require an owner or agent of a vacant or abandoned property in violation of
this Section or any other ordinance applicable to the property or structure to
provide proof of insurance, and no owner or agent shall fail to provide such
proof when so ordered.
 
   (c)   The Director may take any action necessary to inspect a vacant or
abandoned property, and to abate a vacant or abandoned property nuisance, as
authorized in this Chapter. Upon inspection of a vacant or abandoned structure,
the Director may take any action authorized by law to ensure that the property,
including the structure, is maintained according to the requirements of all
applicable ordinances.
 
   (d)   No insurance company doing business in the Village shall pay a claim
of any named insured, including any lien holder, for damage to a vacant or
abandoned structure, other than fire damage covered by Chapter
1511 of the Codified Ordinances, unless and until the carrier follows the
procedures in this Section. The carrier shall request from the Village an
affidavit signed by the Director of Finance that states whether the Village has
any unpaid costs or whether any abatement orders have been issued containing an
estimated cost of work associated with the abatement of any existing nuisance
condition, as defined in this Chapter, at the insured property. The Village
shall provide an affidavit in response to the request of an insurance carrier
within thirty (30) days of receiving a request. If the affidavit states that
the Village has no unpaid costs or outstanding abatement orders, the carrier
may pay the claim. If the affidavit states that there are unpaid costs the
insurance carrier shall pay to the Village such costs or the full amount of the
claim owed to the insured, whichever is less. If the affidavit states that
there is an outstanding abatement order, the insurer shall pay into an escrow
fund established for the purpose of this Section the amount of the estimated
cost of abatement or the full amount owed to the insured, whichever is less.
Funds shall be disbursed from the escrow to the Village upon the presentation
of an invoice showing the amount incurred by the Village to abate the nuisance.
Funds shall be disbursed to the insured only upon the written authorization of
the Director of Finance, which shall be provided after the Village is provided
proof that the nuisance has been abated, or that an amount equal to the amount
in escrow has been expended in the performance of work to abate the nuisance on
the property.
 
   (e)   No person, other than the owner, agent, lessee or other person with
lawful control of or access to a vacant property that is deemed to be a
nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section or abandoned pursuant to
subsection (a) of this Section, may enter, remain on, or refuse to leave, or
alter or destroy, the grounds or any structure on such property. Any person who
violates such prohibition, shall be deemed to have entered, remained on,
refused to leave, altered or destroyed the property of another without that
person's consent, and without the privilege, authority or permission to do so,
as such terms are used in Chapter
541 of the Codified Ordinances. Any person who violates this subsection may be
ordered by the Police or any authorized person to leave the premises or the
Police may arrest such person for violating this subsection or a provision of
Chapter
541. Any vehicle remaining on the grounds of such a property that is not titled
in the name of the owner or the ownership is unknown, or that is otherwise in
violation of any provision of the Codified Ordinances, shall be deemed to be
parked without the consent, authority or permission of the owner, agent, lessee
or party in control of the property. The prohibitions in this subsection do not
apply to any employee or agent of any governmental entity, including the
Village, which has the lawful authority to enter such property, when such
person is acting in their official capacity as an employee or agent.
 
   (f)   Any vacant property that has been deemed to be a nuisance or abandoned
pursuant to this Section shall be considered to be in the custody of the
Village, and the Village shall be deemed to be the lawful agent of the owner of
the property, solely for the purposes of Chapter
541 of the Codified Ordinances. This subsection confers no authority to or duty
upon the Village over a property as an agent or custodian other than to protect
such properties from trespassers or other persons who may enter such properties
without the authority, consent or privilege to do so from the lawful owner,
agent, lessee, or party in control or possession of such properties, and who
may vandalize and damage the grounds or structures thereon leading to further
deterioration and neighborhood blight. This subsection confers no new or
different authority or duty on the Village as to the condition, safety or
security of any private property other than the specific authority conferred
expressly herein, and such authority is in addition to, and not in derogation
or substitution of, the authority of the Village pursuant to its police powers.
This subsection is not intended to, nor does it, require the Village to be or
make the Village responsible or liable to any person for the condition, safety
or security of any private property.
 
   (g)   The Director or the Director's designee may file a complaint with the
Police Department or Prosecutor of the Village based on any violation of
subsection (e) of this Section or any violation under Chapter
541 of the Codified Ordinances against a property that is in the custody of the
Village or for which the Village is deemed the agent of the owner pursuant to
this Section. The Police or Prosecutor may take any lawful action including,
but not limited to, the filing of a criminal complaint in Municipal Court
against any person who violates any provision of Chapter
541 of the Codified Ordinances or subsection (e) of this Section.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.08 FORECLOSURE REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Any person or entity filing a civil case in any court for the purpose
of foreclosing on any commercial, residential, institutional or any other
property in the Village shall, within thirty (30) days after the filing date,
register the action and property with the Department of Building and Housing
and pay the fee, as set forth in this Section. A foreclosure filed by a
governmental entity shall be exempt from this registration requirement.
 
   (b)   Registration of a foreclosure action and the property that is the
subject of the foreclosure shall be made on the form or forms provided by the
Department of Building and Housing.
 
     (c)   The fee for registration of a foreclosure action and the foreclosed
property shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). The fee for a
foreclosure registration submitted after the 30th day following the filing of
the foreclosure shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00). No registration shall
be accepted or considered submitted unless and until the registration form has
been completely and accurately filled out, and the applicable fee has been
paid.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.09 EMERGENCY ABATEMENT.
   (a)   In cases in which the Director finds that a nuisance condition exists
which constitutes an emergency involving immediate danger to human life or
health, or an immediate threat of substantial and/or irreparable physical or
economic damage to a structure, the Director may declare such condition a
nuisance and order its immediate abatement, and the Director may take action
necessary to immediately abate the violation constituting a nuisance without
advance notice to the owner. Such action may include entering a property for
the purposes of conducting an inspection, to the extent and in the manner
allowed by law, ordering that the property be immediately vacated, ordering the
cessation of utility service if necessary to protect life, health or property,
and/or abate the violation constituting the nuisance.
 
   (b)   If the Director abates a nuisance pursuant to this Section, notice
shall be provided to the owner within three (3) days after the start of the
abatement work in the same manner as notice is required in this Section for
non-emergency nuisance abatement.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.10 APPEALS.
   (a)   Whenever an order or notice of violation is issued, or the Village
takes any other action pursuant to this Chapter, the person that is the subject
of the order, notice or action may appeal such order, notice or action to the
Board of Appeals within thirty (30) days from the date of the date of the
order, notice or action.
 
   (b)   When a nuisance subject to this Chapter has not been abated within the
time prescribed in the notice, the Director may authorize the immediate
abatement of such nuisance by the Village notwithstanding the pendency of an
appeal of such order/notice to the Board of Appeals. If, as a result of such
appeal, the Board overturns the order of the Director, then the owner shall not
be obligated to pay to the Village its costs to abate the nuisance.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.11 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.
   The authority to abate nuisances, and the procedures required herein, as set
forth in this Chapter, shall be in addition to and shall not limit the
authority to abate nuisances granted in the Village's Health Code or otherwise
in this Administrative Code or in other ordinances of the Village or the laws
or Constitution of the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 2024-19. Passed 9-30-24.)
107.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY.
   (a)   If a property owner, lessee, or party in control fails to comply with
any provision of this Chapter, or any order issued pursuant to this Chapter,
such failure shall be considered a first degree misdemeanor and, upon a plea of
guilty or conviction thereof, shall be punished in accordance with Section
101.99 of the Administrative Code. Each day of violation shall be considered a
separate offense.
   (b)   If a person or entity required to register a foreclosure and
foreclosed property pursuant to Section
107.08 fails to register as required by that section, such failure shall be
considered a first degree misdemeanor and, upon a plea of guilty or conviction
thereof, shall be punished in accordance with Section
101.99 of the Administrative Code. Each day of violation shall be considered a

   The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, upon finding that one or more
nuisance activities declared in this Chapter have occurred within any eighteen-
month period at or within 300 feet of a property, may cause a written warning
letter to be served on the owner of the property declaring that such property
may be declared a nuisance property if a second or additional nuisance
activities occur at or within 300 feet of the property within any eighteen-
month period. The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, upon finding that
two or more nuisance activities declared in this Chapter have occurred within
any eighteen-month period at or within 300 feet of any property, may cause a
written notice and order to be served on the owner of the property declaring
that such property is a nuisance property. The notice and order shall set forth
the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance,
and state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of abatement by
taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as set forth in this
Section. The notice shall further state that if a third or subsequent nuisance
activity as declared in this Chapter occurs within eighteen months of the dates
of the first two activities, the Village may abate the nuisance by responding
to the activities using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the
costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. Notice
shall be served as set forth in Section
107.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2024-20. Passed 9-30-24.)
108.03 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE AND COLLECTION OF COSTS.
   (a)   If within eighteen months after the first of the two nuisances
referred to in Section 108.02 has occurred, a third nuisance activity as
declared in this Chapter occurs, the Village may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property in
the same manner as in Section
107.05 of the Codified Ordinances, and the costs shall be calculated as set
forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The Village shall provide notice to
the owner of the nuisance property of the Village's intent to assess the costs
of abatement against the owner's property at least thirty (30) days before such
costs are certified to the County for assessment against the property, and such
notice shall contain a description of the nuisance activity that is the basis
for the notice of intent to assess the property, and the cost to abate. Notice
shall be served as set forth in Section
107.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer or officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus seventy-five percent (75%), multiplied by the number of hours required to
abate the nuisance.
(Ord. 2024-20. Passed 9-30-24.)
108.04 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief of
Police or the Chief's designee pursuant to this Chapter may appeal such notice
by submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police
within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds
that the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the
Chief shall rescind the notice. Otherwise, the Chief shall deny the request and
advise the appellant in writing of the denial and of the appellant's right to
file an appeal to the Board of Appeals. The owner may appeal the denial of the
request for reconsideration by submitting a written appeal letter to the Board
of Appeals within thirty (30) days of the date of the Chief's denial. Any such
appeal shall not stay any actions by the Village to abate the first or any
subsequent nuisance activity. In any such appeal, the Village must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property or of the intent of the Village to assess the property for abatement
costs, whichever is applicable, is justified. The Village shall be deemed to
have failed to meet this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance
of evidence that:
   (a)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
   (b)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and
vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised Code
Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9), or
   (c)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9). (Ord. 2024-20. Passed 9-30-24.)
108.05 EFFECT ON VILLAGE AUTHORITY.
   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the
assessment of costs by the Village on a property, do not affect or limit the
Village's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the Village's ordinances. (Ord.
2024-20. Passed 9-30-24.)

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex ref. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in Rule
9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a written
order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the
same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a
condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall transmit to
the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case,
and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the
transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by
ordinary mail of his trial date." Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish
a traffic violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the
designated offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in
lieu of court appearance.

   (a)    Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject
to Village Income Taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the Village of
Linndale shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit
is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the Village of Linndale, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Village of Linndale for the
purposes of municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of
a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the Village of
Linndale, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)    Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation
percentage to be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and
sales, each of which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
         A.    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village, during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)    In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not
produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted so as to produce such result.
 
   (b)    Sales Made in the Village. As used in Section
181.05 (a)(1)C. "sales made in the Village of Linndale" mean:
      (1)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a

employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399.00 or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
          (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on twenty
(20) or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
191.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
             (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer or the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
191.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
       (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

   (A)   An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
191.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance/chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.

due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
191.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
 
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
 
   (K)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
 
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
 
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.

extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
 
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 191st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 191st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
 
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
 
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
 
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
 
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
 
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
 
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass- through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions    (R)    through (Y)
of Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
 
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
191.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to for
"net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
 
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
 
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

191.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by
multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other
compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the LOWER of the tax
rate in such other municipality OR the tax rate of 2.00%.
   
   (B)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
191.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.

an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
191.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
          (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
191.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
191.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
191.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
191.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)    (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
191.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
191.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
191.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)    (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
       (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-49. Passed 12-1-15.)
191.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation

claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no

levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail

requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

191.99 for a violation of Section
191.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section

storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section "private residential property" means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model and color, the location from which it was
removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other

to 4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with Section
303.082.
   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,

from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of

municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle's license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private property in the
chief's jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away zone of which
the chief has received notice under this section. The record shall include all

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of

shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish

presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.

without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation

fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

excluding a driveway. It shall be an offense for any person to park, cause, or
permit the parking of a vehicle or equipment within any front yard or side yard

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

315.02 GENERAL.
   (a)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the traffic code ordinances of
the Village of Linndale, the Village hereby adopts a civil enforcement program
for automated speed enforcement system violations as outlined in this Chapter.
This program imposes monetary liability on the registered owner of a vehicle
for failure of an operator thereof to strictly comply with the posted speed
limit in school zones or streets or highways within the Village of Linndale.
The imposition of liability under this Chapter shall not be deemed a conviction
for any purpose and shall not be made part of the operating record of any
person upon whom the liability is imposed.
   (b)    The Chief of Police shall be responsible for administering the
automated speed enforcement program. Specifically, the Chief of Police shall be
empowered to deploy and operate the automated speed enforcement system within
the Village of Linndale.
   (c)   Any citation for an automated speed system violation pursuant to this
section, known as a "notice of liability" shall:
      (1)   Be approved by a law enforcement officer of the Village of Linndale
Police Department who shall (a) examine evidence of an alleged violation
recorded by the automated speed enforcement system to determine whether a
speeding infraction has occurred, and (b) determine whether the recorded images
in connection with an alleged violation shows an infraction, contains a date
and time of the alleged violation, shows the letters and numerals on the
vehicle's license plate and shows the state in which the license plate was
issued.
      (2)   Be forwarded by first-class mail or personal service to the
registered owner's address as given on the state's motor vehicle registration.
      (3)   Clearly state the manner in which the violation may be appealed.
      (4)   Comply with any state law requirement that a local authority shall
use a traffic law photo-monitoring device to detect and enforce traffic law
violations only if a law enforcement officer is present at the location of the
device at all times during the operation of the device.
         (Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.03 OFFENSE.
   (a)    The vehicle owner shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to
this section if such vehicle is operated at a speed in excess of those set
forth in Section
333.03 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Linndale, Ohio or Ohio
Revised Code Section 4511.21 as each may be amended from time to time, provided
that:
      (1)   For a system location that is located within a school zone or
within the boundaries of a state or local park or recreation area, the Village
shall not issue a violation as described in this Chapter using an automated
speed enforcement system unless the vehicle involved in the violation is
traveling at least six miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
      (2)   For a system location that is located within any other location
than those described in Section
315.03(a)(l) above, the Village shall not issue a violation as described in
this Chapter using an automated speed enforcement system unless the vehicle
involved in the violation is traveling at least ten miles per hour over the
posted speed limit.
   (b)   A person or entity who receives a notice of liability or ticket for a
civil violation shall elect to do one of the following:
      (l)    In accordance with the instructions on the notice of liability,
pay the civil penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the
opportunity to contest the violation;
      (2)   (i)    Within thirty days after receipt of the notice of liability,
provide the Village of Linndale Police Department with either of the following
affidavits:
            (A)   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party; or
            (B)    An affidavit by the vehicle owner stating that at the time
of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates of the motor vehicle
involved were stolen or were in the care, custody, and control of some person
who did not have the owner's permission to use the motor vehicle, or that the
motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at
the time of the violation. In order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or
license plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the
control or possession of the vehicle owner at the time of the violation, the
vehicle owner must submit proof that a police report, incident report/general
offense report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior
to the violation or within 48 hours after the violation occurred.
         (ii)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law
violation if, within thirty days after the date of mailing of the notice of
liability, the registered owner furnishes an affidavit specified in Section
315.03(b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) to the Village in a form established by the Village
and the following conditions are met:
            (A)   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
section
315.03(b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request
an administrative hearing within thirty days or is determined liable in an
administrative hearing;
            (B)   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
section
315.03(b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division;
            (C)   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or
a motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the Village of Linndale Police
Department of the name and address of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle
at the time of the traffic law violation. A motor vehicle leasing dealer or
motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged traffic law
violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not liable for a
ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of
a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation.
The dealer shall not pay such a ticket or notice of liability and subsequently
attempt to collect a fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge for any
payment of such a ticket made on behalf of the lessee or renter.
            (D)   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the notice of liability is issued to a corporate
entity, provide to the Village of Linndale Police Department an affidavit,
sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the corporate entity, that provides the
name and address of the employee who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation and who is the designated party.
            (E)    Contest the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the notice of liability. The person or entity
shall file the written request not later than thirty days after receipt of the
notice of liability.
The failure to request a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver
of the right to contest the violation and notice of liability, and is deemed to
constitute an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest
the violation.
   (c)    In the event that the Village and/or the Village of Linndale Police
Department receives from a registered owner an affidavit described in
315.03 (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) or a notice described in
315.03 (b)(2)(ii)(C) or (D) hereof, the Village may proceed to send a notice of
liability that conforms with Section
315.04  to the designated party. The Village shall send the notice of liability
to the designated party not later than twenty-one days after receipt of the
affidavit or notification.
   (d)   A certified copy of the notice of liability alleging the violation of
this Ordinance occurred, sworn to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer of
the Village of Linndale Police Department, with the recorded images produced by
an automated speed enforcement system photographic system shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts contained therein and shall be admissible in a proceeding
alleging a violation under this Ordinance.
   (e)   Exception for emergency or public safety vehicles:
The provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to emergency vehicles or
public safety vehicles when those vehicles are responding to emergency or call
for emergency service.
(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.04 NOTICE OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   The notice of liability shall be processed by the Village of Linndale
or its designee and shall be served by ordinary mail to the owner's address as

its equivalent, of the state in which it is registered. The notice of liability
shall include:

      (6)   A copy of the recorded image(s);
      (7)   The amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the

administrative appeal may be initiated and the procedure for disclaiming
liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in any of those sections;
      (10)   The date of issuance of the notice of liability;
      (11)   EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (a)(11) hereof was repealed by

the motor vehicle was involved in a traffic law violation, and a statement
indicating that the recorded images are prima facie evidence of that traffic
law violation, both of which may be signed electronically;
      (13)    A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.098 or Village of Linndale Codified
Ordinances Sections
315.03 or
315.07 is deemed to be an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity
to contest the violation.
   (b)   A notice of liability issued under this Ordinance shall be mailed no
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the alleged violation.
   (c)   Except as provided under Section
315.03(b), the Village of Linndale or its designee may not mail a notice of
liability to a person who is not the registered owner.
   (d)   It is prima facie evidence that the person registered as the owner of
the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (or with any other
applicable state vehicle registration office) was operating the vehicle at the
time of the offense set out in Section
315.03(a). This evidence and presumption may be rebutted in accordance with
Section
315.03(b) or
315.07 of this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Linndale.
 
   (e)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the liability of
an owner of a vehicle for any violation of Section
315.03.
(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.05 CIVIL PENALTIES
   (a)   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a citation from a
police officer at the time of the violation, or unless the exception or defense
to liability set forth in Section
315.03(d) applies, the registered owner or designated party for the motor
vehicle is subject to a civil penalty if the motor vehicle is recorded by an
automated speed enforcement system while being operated in violation of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15; Ord. 2016-03. Passed 1-5-16.)
   (b)   The civil penalty under this Chapter shall be in accordance with the

within this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be imposed as a default fee.
Failure to pay penalty and the twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee within sixty
(60) days from the date of mailing of the notice will result in the imposition
of an additional twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee, brining the default fee to
forty dollars ($40.00).
         (Ord. 2021-15. Passed 5-4-21.)

hereunder shall be assessed against the person or entity found to be liable

contest liability for the violation under Section
315.03 of this Chapter.
      (6)   Persons who choose to pay the civil penalty without appearing
before a Hearing Examiner as set forth in Codified Ordinance Section
315.07 may do so in the manner indicated on the notice of liability.
      (7)   A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this
Ordinance is not a moving violation for the purpose of assessing points under
Ohio Revised Code Section 4507.021 for minor misdemeanor moving traffic
offenses and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner or operator
of the motor vehicle and shall not be reported to Bureau of Motor Vehicles, nor
shall such a violation be recorded on the driving record of the owner or
operator of the vehicle involved in the violation.

(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.07 ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL HEARING PROCESS.
   (a)   A registered owner or designated party may contest the notice of
liability by filing a written request for an administrative hearing to review
the notice of liability with the Village police department or its designee. A
written notice of request for an administrative hearing must be received by the
Village police department, or its designee, within thirty (30) calendar days
after the date of issuance of the notice of liability. The failure to give
notice of request for an administrative hearing within this time period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to contest the notice of liability. A hearing
officer shall conduct administrative hearings. Administrative hearings shall be
held within forty-five (45) business days of the date that timely request for a
hearing is received by the Village or its designee, but not sooner than twenty-
one days from receipt by the Village of such request; this time may be extended
upon a reasonable written request for additional time or upon reasonable
notification of the hearing officer or Village with notice to all parties. The
administrative hearing shall be open to the public, and a hearing schedule
shall be posted in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the hearing room
that shall identify, by alleged violator, the administrative hearings scheduled
for that day and the time of each hearing. More than one hearing may be
scheduled for the same time to allow for such things as non-appearances or
admissions of liability.
      (1)   The Hearing Officer shall determine whether a preponderance of
evidence establishes that a traffic law violation occurred and the person
requesting the administrative hearing is the party operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation. The hearing officer shall advise the person or entity on
the day of the hearing of the Hearing Officer's decision.
         (i)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the notice of liability is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a written
decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and
submit it to the Village of Linndale or its designee and the person or entity
named in the notice of liability.
         (ii)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but
the person or entity named in the notice of liability is not the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall
issue a written decision finding that the individual or entity is not liable
for the violation and submit it to the Village of Linndale or its designee and
the person or entity named in the notice of liability.
         (iii)   If the person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the local authority or its designee and the person or
entity named in the notice of liability.
   (b)   If the registered owner or designated party chooses to contest the
notice of liability, the Hearing Officer may consider any of the following as
an affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being established by a
preponderance of the evidence by the registered owner or responsible party:
      (1)   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the
traffic law violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation, the vehicle
owner must submit proof that a police report, incident report/general offense
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior to the
violation or within 48 hours after the violation occurred.
      (2)   That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation.
      (3)   That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
      (4)   Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to Section
315.07(b)(1) of this Ordinance, that the registered owner or person named in
the notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation. To satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner
or person named in the notice of liability shall provide to the Hearing Officer
evidence showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle
at the time of the traffic law violation, including, but not limited to, the
operator's name and current address, and any other evidence the Hearing Officer
deems pertinent.
      (5)   That the motor vehicle operator was yielding the right-of-way to an
emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
      (6)   That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to yield
the right-of-way to either of the following:
         (i)    A public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle in accordance with
section 4511.45 of the Ohio Revised Code; or
         (ii)    A funeral procession in accordance with Section 4511.451 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (7)   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
      (8)   That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is not liable.
   (c)   If the Hearing Officer finds that the person or entity named in the
notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence under Section
315.07(b)(4) identifying the designated party, the Hearing Officer shall
provide it to the Village of Linndale or its designee within five (5) calendar
days, along with a copy of any evidence substantiating who was operating the
motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to this
Section or pursuant to Section
315.03(b), the Village of Linndale or its designee may issue a notice of
liability, with the name and address of the designated party and the
information required by Section
315.04 of this Chapter, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
      (2)   A notice of liability issued under this Section
315.07(c), shall be sent by the Village of Linndale or its designee by ordinary
mail no later than twenty-one (21) business days after the receipt of the
evidence from the Hearing Officer. The content of a notice of liability issued
under this subsection shall be the same as set forth in division (a) of Section
315.04 of this Chapter.
      (3)   If a designated party who was issued a notice of liability under
Section
315.07(c) hereof contests the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the notice of liability not later than thirty
days after receipt of the notice of liability, the Village of Linndale shall
require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the hearing.
If at the hearing involving the designated party the hearing officer cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The hearing
officer then shall issue a written decision imposing liability for the
violation on the registered owner and submit it to the local authority or its
designee and to the registered owner. If the designated party also is a
registered owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (d)   A person who is named in a notice of liability for a civil violation
may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with division (D) of section
2317.02 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (e)   A person or entity may appeal a written decision rendered by a hearing
officer under this section to the municipal court or county court with
jurisdiction over the location where the violation occurred.
(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.08 CALIBRATION.
   The manufacturer or operator of the automated speed enforcement system used
by the Village, or an independent calibration laboratory, shall calibrate said
device before it is used by the Village. The manufacturer or operator of the
automated speed enforcement system shall certify to the accuracy of each
traffic law photo-monitoring device in accordance with applicable federal law,
if any. For each traffic law photo-monitoring device that is considered mobile
or portable, meaning it is attached to a trailer, vehicle, or other apparatus
that is easily transported to different system locations, the Village shall
perform or cause to be performed a system self-test and calibration
verification of said traffic law photo-monitoring device in accordance with the
manufacturer's specifications prior to its use at each system location. For
each device that is considered mobile or portable, meaning it is attached to a
trailer, vehicle or other apparatus that is easily transported to different
system locations, the Village police department or its designee shall clearly
and conspicuously mark on the outside of the trailer, vehicle, or apparatus
that contains the traffic law photo-monitoring device that the device is the
property or under the control of the Village.
(Ord. 2015-07. Passed 2-3-15.)
315.09 SIGNS.
   The Village Service Department shall erect signs on every highway, which is
not a freeway, that is part of the state highway system and that enters into
the Village and at each fixed system location. The signs shall inform inbound
traffic that the Village utilizes traffic law Photo-monitoring devices to
enforce traffic laws. The signs shall be erected within the first three hundred
feet of the boundary of the Village and any fixed system location or, if the
signs cannot be located within the first three hundred feet of the boundary of
the Village or a fixed system location, as close to that distance as possible,
in accordance with Ohio Revised Code.

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.

subsections. (ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed

      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
 303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) hereof, is guilty of a

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this

purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation

restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.

   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the Official shall make such
investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. If the
Official shall determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a
violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of
initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed by the Official.
   (d)    The Official is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the
Ohio Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation
under this chapter.
   (e)    If the Official determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall dismiss such
complaint or order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided,
that he shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the
complainant an opportunity to appear before him.
   (f)    If the Official, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall immediately schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Official
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Official prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Official. The hearing shall be held not less
than fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The
summons so issued must be signed by the Official and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Official in person or by duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The Official shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record
shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Official shall furnish such party a copy
of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as he deems appropriate and
reasonable.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Official shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, he shall, after consultation with the Village Solicitor
in executive session, state his findings to and cause the Solicitor to prepare
and issue an order under his directive requiring the person complained against
to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative
action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice that, if he
determines that the person complained against has not after fifteen (15)
calendar days following service of the order complied with the order, he will
recertify the matter to the Solicitor for enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Solicitor for enforcement, the Solicitor
shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the
Fair Housing Official of the Village of Linndale before a court of competent
jurisdiction. In any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has
been a violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages
and, where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court
may also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Official shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained

and issue an order dismissing the complaint.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

705.01 PURPOSE.
   Although an alarm system is important as a deterrent to unlawful entry,
continued malfunctioning or employee error compromise the effectiveness of the
system. Frequent response by the police to these alarms is not only expensive,
but also creates a risk of injury to the responding officer and others and a
risk of damage to property. Based upon these considerations, the purpose of
this chapter is to impose more drastic controls on alarm subscribers and users.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    “False alarm” means an emergency alarm activated and to which the
Police Department responds which is not in response to actual or attempted
burglary, holdup, aggravated assault, unlawful entry or other bona fide
emergency requiring immediate police response. False alarms include negligently
or accidently activated alarms; alarms which are activated to off- premises
locations by certain noise levels which alarm is communicated to the Police
Department and the same is the result of a mistaken belief that an unlawful
entry or other emergency is about to occur; alarms which are the result of
faulty, malfunctioning or improperly installed or maintained equipment; alarms
which are the result of improperly installed, secured or maintained windows,
doors or similar general areas of the building; and alarms which are purposely
activated to summon the police in nonemergency situations.
   False alarms shall not include alarms willfully activated by alarm
subscribers or users that are on the premises where the alarm is installed,
upon good faith belief that an actual or attempted burglary, holdup, aggravated
assault, unlawful entry or other bona fide emergency is about to occur, when
the cause has been proven to be an act of God, or malfunction caused by testing
or repairing of telephonic lines maintained and operated by public utilities
under the regulation of the Public Service Commission.
   (b)    "Alarm system" means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or
electrical, arranged to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry, holdup,
aggravated assault or other bona fide emergency at a premises requiring an
immediate response to the scene by the Police Department.
   (c)    "Subscriber" means any user who employs the services of a central
alarm system.
   (d)    "User" means any person owning, using and/or operating an alarm
system.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.03 AUTHORITY TO INSTALL ALARM.
   Any residence, lawful business, church, school or other similar structure
located within the Village may be equipped with an emergency alarm for the
purpose of detecting an unauthorized intrusion upon compliance with this
chapter, including those pertaining to permits.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.04 BANK, SAVINGS AND LOAN ALARMS.
   (a)    The Mayor or his authorized representative may issue a permit or
permits for such connection upon proper application by the bank or savings and
loan.
   (b)    Connection to the police emergency alarm panel shall be contingent
upon the applicant having obtained permission from the company which maintains
the alarm panel in the police station to make such a connection. Permission
shall not be denied provided equipment is compatible, and provided charges are
paid to such company, and provided a permit has been issued by the Mayor or his
authorized representative.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.05 CENTRAL/LOCAL ALARMS.
   (a)    A local alarm is an alarm that is not connected to the police
emergency panel or to a central alarm station, and which, when activated,
sounds a horn, bell, buzzer or other type of audible alarm.
   (b)    A permit shall be required for the installation of a local alarm if
the sound created by the alarm is audible beyond the premises served. The Mayor
or his authorized representative shall issue a permit for such an alarm upon
proper application, provided the intensity of sound does not exceed sixty-five
decibels at any location outside the premises being served.
   (c)    "Central alarm station system" means a facility operated by an alarm
dealer for the purpose of receiving alarm signals from a subscriber and
relaying information concerning such signals to the Police Department for
response to the scene. Central alarm system subscribers shall be required to
obtain a permit for the installation of a central alarm station system.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.06 FALSE ALARMS.
   (a)    A charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed after six
false alarms received through local alarms, the police emergency panel, the
central alarm station system, or other false alarm received on any other alarm
service which the Village has given permission to be installed. Such fee shall
be assessed against the holder of the permit for the alarm which was falsely
activated.
   (b)    Notwithstanding the fee to be assessed as set forth above, no charge
shall be made for the first false alarm subsequent to the issuance of the
permit; nor shall there be any charge for a false alarm to which there is no
response by the police, nor when the cause has been proven to be an act of God,
nor when the cause has been proven due to the malfunction by testing or
repairing of telephonic lines maintained and operated by public utilities under
the regulation of the Public Service Commission.
   (c)    Any charge for a false alarm which remains unpaid thirty days after
date of invoice shall result in cancellation of the permit.

fee charge for the first calendar year or part of the first calendar year for
all subscribers or users of local alarm systems, central alarm stations
systems, or other authorized systems other than those connected to the police

first month or part of the first month for all subscribers or users connected
to the police emergency panel.

Village by private or residential subscribers or users as provided herein, to

assessed to commercial subscribers or users of local alarm systems, central
alarm stations systems or other authorized systems other than those connected
to the police emergency panel. The annual nonrefundable renewal fee for private
or residential subscribers or users shall be three dollars ($3.00). This fee
shall be invoiced for the first January of the first year following the
issuance of the permit and the first day of each January thereafter as long as
the permit is in effect. Any charges which remain unpaid thirty days after the
date of invoice shall result in cancellation of the permit.
   (d)    There shall be a monthly fee of ten dollars ($10.00) assessed to the
subscriber or user connected to the emergency alarm panel in the Police
Department. This fee shall be invoiced for the first day of the first month

by the Village of the permit requirement.
   (g)    Continued operation of any alarm system beyond the thirty days
without a permit and after notification is in violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)
705.08 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (a)    Failure to comply with any provisions of this chapter may result in
revocation of the subscriber's or user's permit.
   (b)    Grounds for revocation may be, but are not limited to:
      (1)    Failure to properly maintain an installation;
      (2)    When the number of false alarms for an installation equals ten in
any twelve month period.
   
   (c)    The Chief of Police shall serve written notice upon the permit holder
of intent to revoke the permit. Such notice shall be given not less than seven
days prior to revocation. Such notice shall state the right of the permit
holder to appeal to the Mayor within fourteen days from the date of the notice.
   (d)    If an appeal is filed in writing within fourteen days, the Mayor

the facts presented. In the event no appeal is filed, the Chief of Police shall
transmit all pertinent information to the Mayor who shall cancel the permit.
   (e)    The permit holder may have an attorney present at the hearing if so
desired. The administrative remedies must be exhausted before judicial
procedures can begin.

only in emergency situations to summon an immediate police response. Alarm
subscribers and users shall also instruct appropriate employees as to the
operation of the alarm system, to include setting, activation and resetting of
the alarm.
   (b)    Alarm subscribers and users shall be responsible for seeing that
alarm systems are maintained in good working order and that defects which would
cause false alarms are promptly repaired.
   (c)    Subscribers or users of alarm systems who have not contracted with an
alarm dealer for an alarm agent to respond to the scene of alarm activations

to the scene within one-half hour after being requested to do so by the Police
Department, unless good cause is shown.
   (d)    No person shall install or maintain an alarm system which does not
have some safeguard which allows reasonable delay to halt or recall an
accidental alarm activation before the alarm is communicated to the Police
Department for response to the scene.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 11-5-86.)

other recognized industry standards. Applicant may be required to submit
evidence of the reliability and suitability of the equipment to be installed.
   (b)    The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices must be
adjusted to suppress false indications of intrusion, so that the devices will

or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation or other forces
unrelated to genuine alarms.

770.01 GENERALLY.
   (a)   Since the State of Ohio enacted Chapter 3794 of Title 37 of the
Revised Code, entitled Smoking Ban, to prohibit smoking in public places,
smoking lounges have become increasingly popular.
   (b)   Potential adverse impacts associated with these establishments have
been identified such as large numbers of patrons during the evening and night
time, crowds overflowing into parking areas and impeding on nearby businesses,
leaving behind trash, broken alcohol bottles and debris, incidents requiring
police response, fights, alcohol possession on unlicensed premises, traffic,
noise, and complaints from neighboring businesses and residents. The purpose of
this article is to regulate smoking lounges for the public health, safety, and
welfare of the Village and persons within its jurisdictional boundaries; to
prevent access to tobacco and non-tobacco smoking products by minors at these
establishments, and to prevent the spread of smoke fumes to adjacent
properties, and persons passing by these establishments.
   (c)   This Chapter is designed to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent potential adverse impacts relating to these
establishments. The regulations adopted are designed to provide objective and
orderly procedures for the administration of this Chapter.

newspapers, circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means
of notice by publication, the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris,
absence of windows or window treatments, absence of furnishings and personal
items, statements of neighbors, delivery agents or similarly situated persons
that the property is abandoned.
   (b)    The owner(s) of any dwelling structure that has become a vacant
building, as defined in Section
1385.01, shall, within sixty (60) days of becoming vacant according to that
Section, register with the Building Official or his/her designee and designate
an authorized agent located in Cuyahoga County for each vacant dwelling
structure owned or under the control of the owner(s) as defined in Section
1385.01(a)(2). The registration shall remain valid until December 31 of the
year of the date of issuance. The owner shall be required to annually renew the
registration by January 1 of each subsequent year for as long as the dwelling
structure remains vacant and shall pay an annual registration fee of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for each registered dwelling structure. The owner
shall notify the Building Official or his/her designee within twenty (20) days
of any change in the registration information by filing an amended or designee
registration statement on a form provided by the Building Official or his/her
designee for such purposes.
   The registration statement shall include the name and address of the
designated agent and shall reflect the owner's and agent's express agreement to
appear in court when summoned, that the agent shall be authorized to testify on
behalf of the owner in such case, and that the agent's testimony shall be
deemed to be binding upon the owner in any administrative enforcement
proceeding, or court proceeding, instituted by the Village against the owner or
owners of the dwelling structure. The failure of the owner of the vacant
dwelling structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with
the county recorder shall not excuse the owner from compliance with Section
1385.01. Registration under Section
1385.02 of the Codified Ordinances shall not negate the requirements for
registration under Section
1385.01 or any other requirement of Chapter
1385.
      
   (c)    Inspections.
      (1)    The Building Official may inspect or cause to be inspected any
premises in the Village for the purpose of enforcing and assuring compliance
with the provisions of this section. The Building Official shall request the
owner provide access to all interior portions of an unoccupied building in
order to permit a complete inspection; or otherwise the Building Official may
inspect under the authority of a warrant.
      (2)    Vacant properties shall be externally inspected by the Building
Official a minimum of twice per year to ensure compliance with property
maintenance codes.
   (d)    In addition to any other information required by the Building
Official or his/her designee, such as a legal photo identification document or
card the registration statement shall include the name, street address and
telephone number of a natural person eighteen (18) years of age or older,
designated by the owner or owners as the agent authorized to receive, on behalf
of such owner or owners, notices of violations of Village ordinances and for
receiving service of process, in any court proceeding or administrative
enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the property or the
dwelling structure, including but not limited to, notices and processes served
in connection with the enforcement of the Building Code. The authorized agent
must maintain a physical office with a street address in Cuyahoga County, Ohio,
or must actually reside within Cuyahoga County, Ohio. A Post Office Box shall
not satisfy the physical office requirement. An owner who is a natural person
and who meets the requirements of this subsection as to location of residence
or office may designate himself as agent. By designating an authorized agent
under the provisions of this Chapter
1385, the owner consents and agrees to receive any and all notices of violation
of Village ordinances and to receive process in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or dwelling structure, including but not limited to, proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Building Code, by service of the notice or
process on said agent. The designation of an authorized agent under this
Section shall be deemed effective until the owner notifies the Building
Official or his/her designee, in writing, of a change of authorized agent or
files a new annual registration statement.
   (e)    If a vacant dwelling structure is on property subject to a
foreclosure action, the plaintiff in the foreclosure action shall be required
to comply with the provisions of Chapter
1385 if at least one of the following apply:
      (1)    The plaintiff in the foreclosure action is a mortgagee of the
property; and/or
      (2)    The plaintiff in the foreclosure action has assumed possession or
control of the property.
   (f)    Any plaintiff in a foreclosure action required to comply with Chapter
1385 pursuant to Section
1385.01(e) shall, in addition to satisfying all other requirements of this
Section, provide a cash bond to the Building Official or his or her designee,
in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), to secure the continued
maintenance of the property in compliance with the provisions of this Building
Code throughout its vacancy and to reimburse the Village for any fees owed and
expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing and/ or making such
building safe by any legal means including, but not limited to, demolition.
This cash bond obligation shall apply throughout the property's vacancy. If the
inspection required in Section
1385.01(c) results in the identification of violations of the Codified
Ordinances the correction of which would cost more than fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00), then the Village is authorized to require a higher bond,
based on the amount set in the report of such inspection. If the bond is
entirely depleted, the Plaintiff in the foreclosure action shall provide a
second bond for the greater of the cost of repairing the remaining, uncorrected
violations identified in the report of the inspection pursuant to Section
1385.01(c) or fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), whichever is greater. When
the title to the property has transferred, remaining bond funds will be
returned to the Plaintiff in the action if that Plaintiff submits a written
request for such refund within forty-five (45) days of the transfer of title;
otherwise, such funds shall be retained by the Village.
   (g)    An annual administrative fee of one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00) or ten percent (10%) of the required bond, whichever is greater,
will be deducted from the bond by the Village for administrative expenses
including, but not limited to, the processing, accounting, and other
administrative functions inherent in the administration of the foreclosure
bond. The fee shall be deducted at the beginning of each year and shall not be
prorated. These fees will be held in a separate fund. The fees are due from the
date the vacancy began. Except for the initial fee, the annual fee shall be due
on or before January 1 each calendar year.
   (h)    Penalty. Any responsible party who fails to comply with any provision
of this Section shall be subject to a one hundred dollar ($100.00) per day
administrative penalty with a maximum penalty of fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000.00) or shall be guilty of a first degree misdemeanor, or both. Every
day such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense.
   (i)    In the event the Village or one of its contractors, due to a lack of
response of an owner or agent, is required to take action to abate a nuisance
at a vacant property, the owner will be billed for the cost of abatement. If
the same is not paid within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice, the
amount due may be certified to the County Auditor for collection as other taxes
and assessments are collected in accordance with Ohio R.C. 731.54, or the
Director of Law is hereby authorized to seek the recovery of such costs by
civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the property owner.
If the property is subject to a foreclosure bond as set forth in Section
1385.01 herein, said bond will be drawn upon to cover such costs.
(Ord. 2022-12. Passed 4-5-22.)
1385.02 REGISTRATION OF DWELLING STRUCTURE BY OUT-OF-COUNTY OWNERS.
   (a)    If a dwelling structure located within the Village is owned by a
person or persons, none of whom reside within Cuyahoga County, the owner(s) of
the dwelling structure, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of
Section
1385.02 or within thirty (30) days after obtaining ownership of the dwelling
structure, whichever is later, and annually thereafter, shall register with the
Building Official on a form prescribed by the Building Official or his or her
designee and shall designate an authorized agent for each such dwelling
structure. The authorized agent must be a natural person eighteen (18) years of
age or older who maintains a physical office with a street address in Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, or who resides within Cuyahoga County. A Post Office Box shall
not satisfy the physical office requirement. By designating an authorized agent
under the provisions of Section 1385.02, the owner consents and agrees to
receive any and all notices of violation of Village ordinances and to receive
process in any court proceeding or administrative enforcement proceeding
related to the use or maintenance of the property or dwelling structure,
including, but not limited to, proceedings related to the enforcement of the
Building Code, by service of the notice or process on said agent. The
registration statement shall include the name and address of the designated
agent and shall reflect the owner's and agent's express agreement to appear in
court when summoned, that the agent shall be authorized to testify on behalf of
the owner in such case, and that the agent's testimony shall be deemed to be
binding upon the owner in any administrative enforcement proceeding, or court
proceeding, instituted by the Village against the owner or owners of the
dwelling structure. The failure of the owner of the dwelling structure to
obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with the County Recorder
shall not excuse the owner from compliance with Section
1385.02.
   (b)    The designation of an authorized agent under this Section shall be
deemed effective until the owner notifies the Building Official or his/her
designee, in writing, of a change of authorized agent or files a new annual
registration statement, or until the Building Official is notified in writing
that such registration is no longer required because an owner of the dwelling
structure now resides in Cuyahoga County.
   (c)    A violation of Section
1385.02 is hereby classified as a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable
by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment not
more than six (6) months, or both. Every day such violation occurs or continues

1386.01 TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FACILITY.
   (a)   Intent.  The purpose of this section is to allow reasonable
consideration of transitional housing facilities, as defined by this Ordinance,
and to ensure that such housing does not alter the fundamental character of the
Village. This section is further intended to advance legitimate governmental
interests by regulating transitional homes in a manner that ensures that the
use of land is situated in appropriate locations and with proper relationships
particularly to the surrounding land uses, limits inappropriate overcrowding of
land or particular uses and/or congestion of population, and ensures that
public streets and facilities are not overburdened. Such transitional housing
shall be planned, designed and located in a manner that protects public health,
safety and welfare.
   (b)   Applicability.  The provisions of this section shall be applicable to
various types of transitional and permanent homes which occupy dwellings or
other structures. The Village Council may approve a transitional housing
facility subject to and in accordance with this section.
   (c)   Conditions of Approval. As a condition to approval of a transitional
housing facility, the applicant must comply with all the terms of this section,
and must demonstrate all of the following:
      (1)   Taking into consideration the needs, facts, and circumstances which
exist throughout the Village and the population to be served by the use, the
proposed transitional housing facility shall be necessary to afford such
persons served by the home and opportunity to reside in and enjoy the Village;
      (2)   Approval of the proposed housing shall not require or will not
likely result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the neighborhood in
which the property is situated, or result in an excess concentration of such
proposed housing in a particular area, considering the cumulative impact of one
(1) or more other uses and activities in, or likely to be in, the area. The
interests of the Village shall be balanced against the need for accommodation
on a case-by-case basis; and
      (3)   No other specific Ordinance provision exists that is available to
provide the relief sought.
   (d)   Application Provisions.  The application for a transitional housing
facility shall include the following:
      (1)    A concept plan drawn to scale showing the proposed use and
development. At a minimum, the plan shall include the following information:

spaces required and provided.
            (2)    A separate document that provides the number of residents
served, resident services provided and the anticipated length of stay, and
staffing and duties performed.
   (e)   Standards and Regulations.  In order to be entitled to the approval of
a transitional housing facility, the following must be demonstrated by the
applicant:
      (1)     All the requirements for entitlement to approval under subsection
(c) of this section, shall be met;
      (2)    The intensity of the use (e.g., number of residents in the
residential facility) shall be the minimum required in order to achieve
feasibility of the use; and
      (3)    The use, and all improvements on the property shall be designed
and constructed to meet the following standards and conditions:
                  A.    Taking into consideration the size, location and
character of the proposed use, the proposed use shall be established in such a
manner to be compatible and harmonious, as determined by the application of
generally accepted planning standards and/or principles, with;
                     i.    The surrounding uses; and/or
                    ii.    The orderly development of the surrounding
neighborhood and/or vicinity.
             B.    The proposed use shall be designed to ensure that vehicular
and pedestrian traffic shall be no more hazardous than is normal for the
district involved, taking into consideration traffic volume, proximity and
relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access
of off-street parking and pedestrian traffic safety;
                 C.    The proposed use shall be designed and operated so as
not to unreasonably impact upon surrounding property in terms of noise, dust,
fumes, smoke, air, water, odor, light and/or vibration, and shall not
unreasonably impact upon persons perceiving the use in terms of aesthetics;
                  D.    The proposed use shall be such that the location and
height of buildings or structures and location, nature and height of walls,
fences and landscaping will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings and will not have a
detrimental effect upon their value;
                 E.    The proposed use shall be designed, located, planned and
operated in such a manner that the public health, safety and welfare will be
protected; and
                  F.    The proposed use shall be designed and operated so as
not to cause substantial injury to the other property in the neighborhood in
which it is to be located and will not be detrimental to existing and/or other
permitted land uses in the zoning district.
   (f)    Conditions.  In connection with the approval of a transitional
housing facility, the Village Council may impose such conditions as are
authorized by law.
   (g)    Effect of Approval.
      (1)    The effect of an approval under this section shall be for the
exclusive benefit and occupancy of such persons in need of transitional housing
as represented by the applicant. If a change in such use occurs such that it is
occupied by others, the regulations applicable within the district in which the
property is situated shall thereupon immediately and fully apply. An approval
under this section shall not be final until such time as the applicant records
an affidavit at the office of the register of deeds in connection with the
property, providing notice of the terms of this provision.
      (2)    An approval under this section shall be effective for a period of
one (1) year and shall thereafter be void unless there is an occurrence of
actual occupancy by persons for whom the transitional home has been made in
granting approval.
      (3)    Transitional housing facilities shall obtain a certificate of
registration in.
