codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, are before
the Council,
   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL of the Village of Sunbury:

proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.

EDITOR'S NOTE
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5the chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13the chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Sunbury Codified Ordinances was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Sunbury Codified Ordinances is indicated.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

123.01 ESTABLISHED.
   Pursuant to Ordinance 2002-31, passed July 24, 2002, Council has established
the office of Village Fiscal Officer effective January 1, 2004. The Fiscal
Officer shall have all the powers and duties as set forth in Ohio R.C. 733.262.
123.02 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   The Village hereby directs that the investing authority of the Village shall
reside with the Fiscal Officer in accordance with this Investment Policy. This
Policy is designed to cover all monies under the control of the Fiscal Officer
and those that comprise the core investment portfolio. Notwithstanding the
policies detailed below, Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 will be adhered to at all times.
   Management responsibility for the investment program is with the Fiscal
Officer and the Fiscal Officer shall be responsible for the implementation of
the investment program and the establishment of investment procedures
consistent with this policy.
   (a)   Objective and Guidelines.
      (1)   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and
protection of principal while earning investment interest. Safety of principal
is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investment of the Village
of Sunbury shall be undertaken in a manner to ensure the preservation of
capital in the overall portfolio.
      (2)   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable
the Fiscal Officer to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
      (3)   In investing public funds, the Fiscal Officer will strive to
achieve a fair and safe average rate of return on the investment portfolio over
the course of budgetary and economic cycles taking into account state law,
safety considerations and cash flow requirements. Bids will be taken to achieve
a competitive basis as needed.
      (4)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (5)   Bank account relationships will be managed in order to secure
adequate services while minimizing costs. The Village enters into contracts
with various financial institutions to serve as public depositories for the
Village’s active and interim deposits. The most current legislation designating
a public depository for active funds is Resolution 2002-31 for a period of five
years, commencing February 21, 2002.
   (b)   Eligible Investments.
      (1)   U.S. Treasury and Agency securities purchased outright shall be
purchased only through financial institutions located within the State of Ohio
or through “primary securities dealers” as designated by the Federal Reserve
Board.
      (2)   Repurchase agreements shall be transacted only through banks
located within the State of Ohio with which the Fiscal Officer has signed a
Master Repurchase Agreement as required in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
      (3)   Certificates of Deposit shall be transacted through commercial
banks or savings and loans with FDIC or FSLIC coverage, which are located
within the State of Ohio and qualify as eligible financial institutions under
Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
      (4)   A list of authorized institutions and dealers shall be maintained
with the Fiscal Officer. Additions and deletions to this list shall be made
when deemed in the best interest of the Fiscal Officer and the Village.
      (5)   No public deposit shall be made except in qualified public
depositories as established in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135. The State Treasurer’s
investment pool (commonly referred to as STAROhio) is considered a qualified
depository for public monies by Ohio R.C. 135.45 and 135.14(G)(1).
      (6)   Investment of interim monies in certificates of deposit pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 135.144 provided interim monies are initially deposited with an
eligible public depository described in Ohio R.C. 135.03 and selected pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 135.12.
   The full amount of principal and any accrued interest in each certificate of
deposit invested pursuant to this section shall be insured by Federal Deposit
Insurance and the eligible public depository selected shall comply with all
requirements of Ohio R.C. 135.144.
   (c)   Authorized Financial Institutions and Dealers.
      (1)   U.S. Treasury and Agency securities purchased outright shall be
purchased only through financial institutions located within the State of Ohio
or through “primary securities dealers” as designated by the Federal Reserve
Board.
      (2)   Repurchase agreements shall be transacted only through banks
located within the State of Ohio with which the Fiscal Officer has signed a
Master Repurchase Agreement.

banks or savings and loans with FDIC or FSLIC coverage, which are located
within the State of Ohio. Certificates of Deposit purchased pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 135.144 shall originally be deposited only with an eligible public
depository described in Ohio R.C. 135.03 and selected pursuant to Ohio R.C.
135.12.
      (4)   A list of authorized institutions and dealers shall be maintained
with the Fiscal Officer. Additions and deletions to this list shall be made
when deemed in the best interest of the Village.
   (d)   Collateral. Before making initial deposits, financial institutions
shall pledge to and deposit with the Fiscal Officer, security for repayment of
all monies. Eligible securities for pledging include U.S. bonds, notes, etc.,
federal government agencies and instrumentalities, bonds of this state, bonds
of subdivisions of this state, certain bonds of other states, shares of certain
no-load money market mutual funds. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.144(B), interim
monies deposited or invested in accordance with Ohio R.C. 135.44 are not
subject to any pledging requirements as described in Ohio R.C. 135.18 or
135.181.
   (e)   Continuing Education. The Fiscal Officer and those staff delegated
authority by the Fiscal Officer to buy and sell securities shall complete
continuing education course work including, but not limited to, that required

inventory of all obligations and securities acquired. The inventory shall

and settlement date and coupon rate. The Fiscal Officer shall produce a monthly
portfolio report detailing the current inventory of all obligations and
securities and all transactions during the month, income received and
investment expenses paid.

every quarter to review the portfolio in detail, including the term of
security, type, risk and investment return. The Fiscal Officer shall be
responsible for maintaining records of all investments and deposits and
preparing reports for the Finance Committee meeting.
   (h)   Acknowledgment by Financial Institution. All brokers, dealers and
financial institutions initiating transactions with the Investment Authority by
giving advice or making investment policy or executing transactions initiated
by the Investment Authority, must acknowledge their agreement to abide by the
investment policy’s content. (Res. 2006-06. Passed 7-12-06.)
123.03 TIMELY REPORTING OF FINANCIAL DATA TO COUNCIL.

   139.07 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.
   (a)   The Village of Sunbury does not discriminate against a qualified
individual with a disability because of the disability with regard to job
application or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, or
other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
   (b)   A qualified individual with a disability is one who, with or without
reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment
position that such individual holds or desires.
   (c)   A disabled employee or potential employee who requests reasonable
accommodation should identify the specific job requirement that he or she
believes should be modified through reasonable accommodation.
   (d)   The Village of Sunbury will provide necessary reasonable accommodation
if it can do so without undue hardship on the operation of the Village of
Sunbury.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
   139.08 DUTIES.
   Job descriptions to be performed by persons in the employment of the Village
of Sunbury shall be established by the Village Administration with input of the
employee's supervisor and the Village Administrator. The Police Department
employees' job descriptions shall be established by the Chief of Police. Job
descriptions shall be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary. Revised
job description shall be provided to the affected employees who shall
acknowledge receipt in writing.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
   139.09 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS.
   (a)   The Village maintains the right to establish policies governing the
work force for the Village. Such policies shall be consistent with this chapter
and all applicable State and Federal laws. These policies may include, but are
not limited to: determination of methods and procedures, size of the work
force, assignment of duties, hours of employment, compensation of personnel,
hiring, discipline, promotion, transfer, the right to lay off employees for
lack of work, lack of funds, reorganization, or due to job abolishment, and
departmental regulations.
   (b)   These policies do not in any way affect the Village's right to lay
off, discipline or terminate an employee, nor do these policies affect the
employee's right to leave the Village's employment. Employment with the Village
is at will. Employment may be terminated at any time, with or without notice or
with or without cause.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passe 7-6-11.)
   139.10 DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.
   (a)   Discipline is a response to behavior contrary to the interests of the
Village, or unacceptable performance. The type and severity of disciplinary
action will be determined at the discretion of the appropriate supervisor. In
determining the type and severity of disciplinary action, the hiring authority
may consider such factors as the nature and gravity of the problem, the
employee's past disciplinary records and performance record, the employee's
position, and any other factors the hiring authority believes are relevant.
   (b)   The guidelines listed here for imposing discipline are offered solely
to assist the hiring authority in administering disciplinary action. The
guidelines do not in any way limit the appropriate supervisor's discretion to
administer disciplinary action of any type as the supervisor sees fit. As set
forth above, nothing in this chapter is intended to bind the Village
contractually, and employees may not rely on this Disciplinary Action section
or any other provision of this chapter as limiting the Village's discretion to
discipline or discharge. Although the Village may follow a system of
progressive discipline in some cases in order to help employees improve poor or
declining job performance, by utilizing any such progressive procedures, the
Village does not in any way waive or limit its right to discipline or terminate
employment as determined to be in the best interests of the Village.
   (c)   The following types of disciplinaty action may be imposed, as the
supervisor deems appropriate, for instances of inappropriate conduct or
performance:
      (1)   Verbal Counseling or Reprimand: This type of corrective action is
generally applied to the first occmTence of a minor offense or performance
problem. The purpose of the conference is to identify the rule violation or
performance problem and discuss the behavior that is expected. Documentation of
a verbal warning will be placed in the employee's personnel file.
      (2)   Written Counseling Report or Reprimand: A written counseling report
is usually initiated when inappropriate conduct occurs after verbal counseling.
However, a written report may be issued for the first instance of a substantive
mle violation or performance problem without prior verbal counseling. This
disciplinary action is a formal warning through which a supervisor documents a
problem and typically cites the consequences for further violations. The
counseling report/reprimand is reviewed with the employee and a copy of the
document is placed in the employee's personnel file. The employee is generally
offered the chance to acknowledge the reprimand by signature and may provide
written comments in response to the reprimand. Depending on the circumstances
of the discipline, and typically after an employee has received prior verbal
and/or written counseling, the hiring authority may issue a "final" written
warning, indicating that any further instances of misconduct or performance
deficiencies may result in immediate termination.
      (3)   Suspension: A disciplinary suspension may be imposed for severe
infractions or when an employee previously has received written counseling. A
suspension is not a prerequisite to termination; the supervisor may elect to
terminate an employee's employment without initially imposing a suspension. The
supervisor may impose a suspension during the investigation of an alleged
offense, as the possibility of disciplinary action or more serious discipline
is being considered. As with a written counseling report or reprimand, a
suspension is documented and placed in the employee's personnel file, and an
employee may provide written comments in response.
   (d)   Not all misconduct or infractions are subject to progressive
discipline. Actions that constitute serious misconduct or improper performance
of job duties may result in immediate suspension or discharge without prior
warning.
   (e)   The employee has the right to appeal any disciplinary action and
request review by the Mayor. The Village Council reserves the right to review
and/or overturn any suspensions or terminations. (Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
   139.11 DISCIPLINE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The Village may take any of the following disciplinary actions as it
deems appropriate for the particular offense:
      (1)   Counseling Form
      (2)   Oral Reprimand and Instructions in writing
      (3)   Written Reprimand and Instructions
      (4)   Suspension Without Pay
      (5)   Pay Reductions
      (6)   Terminations
   (b)   When discharge occurs, the employee will subsequently be paid for all
time worked up to and including that day.
   (c)   The employee's immediate supervisor reserves the right to determine
which disciplinary action is appropriate given the employee's conduct.
   (d)   Employment at the Village of Sunbury is terminable, at will, at any
time either by the employee or the hiring authority unless otherwise specified
in the Ohio Revised Code. Said employment may be terminated with or without
notice, or with or without cause.
   (e)   The employee has the right to appeal any disciplinary action and
request review by the Mayor. The Village Council reserves the right to review
and/or overturn Section
139.12 (a)(4), (5) and (6) of Discipline Practices and Procedures above.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
   139.12 SENIORITY.
   (a)   Seniority is defined, for the purposes of administering individual
Village Departments, as the length of continuous service with the Village of
Sunbury, Ohio. An authorized leave of absence does not constitute a break in
service and seniority time continues to accumulate during the term of the
leave, provided that the employee complies with rules and regulations governing
his or her leave of absence, and that the employee is reinstated from the
leave.
   (b)   Department seniority is a factor, but not the sole determination
factor, for such purposes as scheduling vacation, selecting applicants for
posted positions, scheduling shift assignments, layoffs, etc. Employees who are
reinstated from layoff will retain all previously accumulated seniority, but
will not be credited with seniority for time spent on layoff.
   (c)   Authorized leaves of absence will not be considered a separation and
seniority will continue so long as the employee is reinstated from the leave.
Vacation and sick leave benefits will not accrue while on authorized leave of
absence, except as where required by applicable law.
   (d)   Seniority, for the purposes of determining retirement benefits, is
defined by the provisions of the retirement system in which the employee
participates.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
   139.13 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   (a)   Under no circumstances shall a full-time employee have other
employment which conflicts with the policies, objectives and operations of the
Village. In addition, an employee shall not become employed with a second
employer whose interests might be in conflict with those of the Village.
   (b)   Employment "conflicts" as set forth in this policy are when a second
job impairs the employee's ability to perform the duties of his or her
position.
   (c)   Full-time employment by the Village shall be considered the employee's
primary occupation, taking precedence over all other occupations.
   (d)   "Outside" employment shall be a concern to the Village only if it
adversely affects the employee's job performance. Two common employment
conflicts which may arise are:
      (1)   Time Conflict- Defined as when the working hours required of a
"secondary job" directly conflicts with the scheduled working hours of an
employee's job with the Village; or when the demands of a "secondary job"
prohibit adequate rest, thereby adversely affecting the quality standard of the
employee's job performance of the Village.
      (2)   Interest Conflict- Defined as when the employee engages in "outside
employment" which tends to compromise his or her judgment, actions and/or job
performance with the Village or creates actual conflict with Village interests.
   (e)   Should the Mayor feel that an employee's outside employment is
adversely affecting the employee's job performance, the Mayor may recommend
that the employee refrain from such activity. However, any conflict, policy
infraction, or other specific offense which is the direct result of an
employee's participation in outside employment shall be disciplined in such a
manner that is consistent with the policies set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)

he/she feels are unsatisfactory.

the department.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.15 EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE.
   (a)   The Department Head shall establish daily work schedules and maintain

cards to insure prompt attendance from all employees and to monitor potential
tardiness of employees. The Department Head is required to report any employee
being tardy for work to the Administrator.
   (b)   Employees may take two 15 minute break periods each full work day.
Break periods shall be considered a privilege and not a right and shall never
interfere with the proper performance of the work responsibilities of the
department. Such breaks shall be considered as part of the employee's work
time. Breaks shall not abut the start or end of the work shift or the start or
end of lunch. Break time is not cumulative.
      (1)   Attendance Policy. Regular and prompt attendance is one of the most
important characteristics of any employee. The varied and complex functions of
the Village cannot be conducted smoothly unless the Village can rely on the
timely and dependable services of the employee.
      (2)   Absence/tardiness. If, for any reason, an employee is unable to
report for work at the usual starting time, the employee's supervisor, or if
the supervisor is unavailable, the employee's department head, or if the
department head is unavailable, the Village Administrator must be notified at
least one hour before the start of the employee's shift, stating a specific
reason for the absence. All employees are required to be on time and ready for
work at the beginning of their set work hours. Employees that are late to work
are subject to disciplinary action. In cases of illness and if deemed
appropriate, a physician's statement may be required of the employee.

139.16 HOURS OF WORK.
   (a)   The normal work day for Village employees shall be eight (8) hours.

provide for minimum hours of operation between 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. All
other departments' hours shall be established by the Department Heads with the
prior approval of the Administrator. The Mayor and/or Administrator may deviate
from these hours if deemed necessary for the best interest of the Village.
   (b)   Employees shall be required to perform the functions of their
positions as required by their schedules. Employees who are habitually late,
leave early or otherwise do not perform their responsibilities as assigned may
be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. All employees are required to clock in/out at the start and end of
each workday. At no time will any employee clock in/out another employee. This

(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.18 LUNCH PERIOD.
   (a)   Lunch periods for employees are one-half hour in length, depending
upon the employee's work schedule and preference. The employee's immediate
supervisor will discuss and set the employee's lunch schedule at the time the
employee's work schedule is set. All employees are required to clock out/in for
lunch break except for Police Department Personnel.
   Neither supervisors nor employees may arrange for a lunch period of less
than the employee's scheduled lunch break, nor may employees forego the lunch
period in order to shorten the work day or to accumulate hours in active pay
status with a goal of obtaining overtime compensation. Violation of this policy
may constitute grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
   (b)   Approved lunch periods are not considered as work time. Each employee
shall be completely relieved from work duty for that time period. This
paragraph does not apply to the Police Department.
   (c)   Lunch periods are not paid, excluding the Police Department. Lunch
periods which are interrupted by authorized calls to duty must be paid time,
since the employee would not be considered to be relieved of all duties. (Ord.
2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.19 PAY PERIOD.
   (a)   There are normally twenty-six (26) pay periods per year. All employees
are to be paid every other Friday for the two week pay period immediately
preceding pay day. The biweekly payroll period for all employees is from 12:01
a.m. Monday through 12:00 midnight on the second Sunday.

will be issued on the preceding Thursday, except under extenuating
circumstances, in which case pay checks will be issued as soon as they are
available.
   (c)   The Clerk/Fiscal Officer is to receive any questions from the

the necessary explanations or inquiries to resolve the matter.

keep for their records.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.20 OVERTIME APPROVAL.
   (a)   All overtime must be pre-approved by the Department Head/
Administrator. Employees who work overtime without receiving prior
authorization may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.
   (b)   Overtime shall be paid to all hourly employees at one and one-half
times the hourly rate for all authorized workers for time worked in excess of
forty (40) hours per week. For purposes of this section, time worked shall
include only that time spent on duty as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), plus time compensated but not actually worked for jury duty, vacation
and holidays, but shall not include any other uncompensated periods or time
which is compensated but not actually worked, including but not limited to,
sick leave, compensatory time off or any other paid or unpaid leave of absence.
The employee shall not be paid for overtime work that has not been pre-approved
by the supervisor. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require the
payment of overtime and/or other premium payment more than once for the same
hours worked and/or credited.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 2-19-14.)
139.21 PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.
   (a)   Certain deductions are made from an employee's paycheck as required by
law, in accordance with employee benefit plans, or as requested by the
employee. These deductions are itemized on the employee's pay statement which
accompanies his or her biweekly paycheck. Deductions include:
      (1)   PERS/PFDPF- The State law requires that employees contribute to the
Public Employees Retirement System or the Police and Fire Disability and
Pension Fund, rather than Social Security.
      (2)   Income Taxes- Federal and State laws and some City ordinances
require that taxes be withheld from each salary payment. The amount of tax to
be withheld is determined from tables furnished to the Village personnel office
by the Ohio Department of Taxation and various Ohio cities, and varies
according to the amount of salary and number of dependency exemptions.
Employees are required to complete withholding tax certificates upon initial
employment and to inform the personnel office of any dependency change whenever
such change occurs.
      (3)   Medicare- Employees hired on or after April, 1986 must participate
in Medicare. Payroll deductions as established by Federal laws will be made by
the Village.
      (4)   Miscellaneous- Examples may include, but are not limited to,
garnishments, deferred compensation, child support, medical insurance,
supplemental insurance, recoupment of overpayments, etc. The Village may refuse
to make deductions, not required by law, which are below certain prescribed
minimum amounts, or at irregular intervals, or for other cause which the
Village deems not in the best interests of the Village. All requests for
payroll deductions must be presented to the Hiring Authority. The Village will
not make any deductions which potentially interfere with an employee status as
exempt or non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act. If an employee feels a
deduction has been made in error, the employee shall notify their supervisor
immediately to investigate the problem.
         (Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.22 ADVANCEMENTS IN PAY/PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   A promotion is an advancement within the same department or division
from one pay rate to a higher pay rate with a change in class title and job
description.
   (b)   The Village Administrator, and in the case of the Police Department,
the Chief of Police may recommend to the Mayor annual pay rate increases in
accordance with annual appropriations approved by Council. Department heads are
required to budget for potential pay increases.
   (c)   Pay increases shall be based upon satisfactory performance
evaluations. The Mayor, with the approval of Council, may annually award
increases within the confines of budget approval. A pay for performance
increase is an increase in the position's pay rate above the annual increase
amount without a change in job title and/or job description. Pay for
performance increases shall be based upon satisfactory performance evaluation.
The Mayor may award merit increases within the confines of budget approval.
After the new employee's six month evaluation, the employee may be awarded a
pay increase based upon performance evaluation. The same applies after the
employee's 12 month evaluation.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.23 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.
   (a)   A written performance evaluation provides supervisors with an
effective mechanism to measure and communicate levels of job performance to
their employees. It provides the employee with documented, constructive
feedback concerning current job performance. Documented performance evaluation
serves as a basis for important management decisions regarding training needs,
job assignments, promotion, pay increases and retention of employees. The work
performance of each full time employee shall be evaluated in accordance with
established procedures.
   (b)   Each employee will be in a probationary period during his/her first
twelve (12) months of employment. Each employee will be evaluated within the
first twelve months of employment as follows:
      (1)   Within 90 days after commencement of employment;
      (2)   Within 180 days after commencement of employment.
   (c)   Each full-time employee shall receive an annual performance evaluation
at such date as the Hiring Authority may determine. Additional evaluations may
be made if authorized by the Hiring Authority.

139.25 INSPECTION AND RELEASE OF EMPLOYMENT/PAYROLL RECORDS.
   (a)   This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records
as including the following: Any document - paper, electronic (including, but
not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or received by, or
comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of the office. All records of the Village of Sunbury are public
unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the applicable
provisions of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the Village of Sunbury that, as required by Ohio
law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (See Section below regarding setting forth
the e-mail policy). Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and
posted prominently.
   (c)   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response
using the following guidelines:
   (d)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (e)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
   (f)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (g)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be emailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. If more copies are requested, an
appointment should be made with the requester on when the copies or computer
files can be picked up. All requests for public records must either be
satisfied (see subsection (d) hereof) or be acknowledged in writing by the
Village of Sunbury within three business days following the office's receipt of
the request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond "routine," such as
seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (h)   The maximum amount of public records request available to a person or
entity requesting transmission by United States mail is 10 per calendar month
unless the person or entity certifies to the Village of Sunbury in writing that
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, or the
information contained in them for commercial purposes. For purposes of this
section, "commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information to assist
citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or activities of
government, or non-profit education research.
   (i)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
   (j)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies.
   (k)   The charge for paper copies is 5 cents per page.
   (l)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1.00
per disc.
   (m)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (n)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (o)   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (p)    Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office
are instructed to retain their e-m ails that relate to public business (see
subsection (a) hereof) and to copy them to their business email accounts and/or
to the office's records custodian.
   (q)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
   (r)   The Village of Sunbury recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences
of failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, (the public office's)
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the Village of
Sunbury to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and
damages. (Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)

139.30 HARASSMENT AND IMPROPER WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR POLICY.
   (a)   Introduction. The Village of Sunbury is committed to work environment
free of inappropriate and disrespectful conduct and communication of a sexual
nature. Consequently, and in an effort to avoid even the appearance of
impropriety, this policy against harassment in some respects exceeds the
requirements of applicable law.
   The Village of Sunbury strongly opposes sexual harassment in any form.
Sexual harassment in the work place by the manager, employee or non-employee,
including any vendor or customer, will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is
against Village policy and is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, as well as the applicable laws of the State.
   (b)   Prohibited Conduct. Sexual harassment refers to behavior of a sexual
nature that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale or
interferes with the work performance and effectiveness of its victims.
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes harassment when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual's employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as a basis for an employment decision affecting such individuals; and/or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   If comments or conduct of a sexual nature are unwelcome by an individual,
they may constitute harassment.
   (c)   Enforcement Procedure. All supervisors are responsible for
implementation of the Village's nondiscrimination policies for ensuring that
all employees they supervise have knowledge of and understand the policies, and
for taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when
necessary to ensure compliance with the policies. All employees are strongly
encouraged to use this complaint procedure if they believe they have been
subjected to discrimination and/or harassment or have knowledge of any
discrimination and/or harassment in the workplace.
   The initiation of a complaint, in good faith, shall not under any
circumstances be grounds for discipline. It is a violation of Village policy
and applicable law for an individual to be disciplined or otherwise
disadvantaged as a result of the good faith resort to this complaint procedure.
   (d)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Employee" includes all personnel.
      (2)   "Sexual Harassment" includes any unwarranted or repeated verbal
physical sexual advances, sexually explicit, provocative or suggestive
statements, innuendo or comments, or sexually oriented conduct or physical
conduct, made by another employee which are reasonably offensive or
objectionable to the recipient or which reasonably causes the recipient
discomfort or humiliation or which reasonably interferes with the recipient's
work performance.
      (3)   This policy also covers other harassment which includes any
conduct, words or action based on race, creed, color, religion, sex, age,
national origin, handicap, disability or veteran's status, which reasonably
causes the recipient discomfort or humiliation, or which is reasonably
offensive or objectionable to the recipient or which reasonably interferes with
the recipient's work performance.
      (4)   "Shall" is mandatory, not permissive.
   (e)   Complaint Procedures.
      (1)   We encourage all employees to attempt to resolve the problem by
informing the person doing the harassment or creating the hostile environment
to cease and desist. If the employee feels uncomfortable doing so, or if
talking to the person does not solve the problem, the employee should report
their concerns to any supervisor, the Village Administrator, the Mayor or the
Solicitor.
      (2)   A complaint of sexual harassment or unwanted conduct shall be
promptly investigated. Every effort will be made to handle all such complaints
in fair, impartial and speedy manner, with concern for the principles of
fairness. In order to protect both the person making the complaint and the
person(s) against whom the complaint is made, every reasonable effort will be
made to handle all complaints in a confidential and discreet manner.
      (3)   All supervisory personnel shall be expressly responsible for
immediately reporting any occurrences they witness or of which they become
aware.
      (4)   Retaliatory action or conduct of any kind taken by any employee of
the Village of Sunbury against an employee as a result of that employee having
sought redress under this policy and procedure is strictly prohibited and shall
be regarded as a separate and distinct violation of this policy.
      (5)   Any questions, concerns or other inquiries regarding the conduct
that is prohibited by this policy or the procedures contained herein shall be
directed immediately to the Village Administrator, Mayor or Solicitor.
   (f)   Non-Compliance. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section
may result in appropriate disciplinary action up to and, including discharge.
(Ord. 2011-11. Passed 7-6-11.)
139.31 WORKERS' COMPENSATION.
   State law provides that every Village employee is eligible for Workers'
Compensation for injuries arising out of or in the course of his or her
employment. Requirements for administering Workers' Compensation are as

Village, the employee must notify his or her supervisor immediately and his or
her supervisor shall then notify the Village Administrator and shall complete

of whether medical attention is required. Such report shall be forwarded to the
Mayor no longer than 24 hours after the accident.
   (b)   Should an employee's injury require medical attention, the supervisor
shall provide the injured employee with all necessary forms which shall be
completed by the employee and the attending physician. All forms should be
forwarded to the Village Administrator immediately. The Village reserves the

an employee continues to be absent due to a work-related injury. Employees are
responsible for providing to the Village Administrator their expected date of
return (if known).

physician, hospital or the State, regarding a Worker's Compensation claim must
be immediately forwarded to the Mayor or designee.

before completing their work period shall be paid at their regular compensatory
rate for the balance of time left in their scheduled workday.
   (h)   Anyone found falsifying BWC documents will be terminated from
employment.

contagious disease which would have the potential of jeopardizing the health of
the employee or the health of the other.**
      (3)   Medical, dental or optical examinations or treatments of employee

   * For purposes of this policy, the "immediate family" is defined as only:
mother, father, child, step-child, spouse, or other relative residing in the
employee's household.

employee or a member of the immediate family shall not exceed three (3) days,

physician's statement or other satisfactory written statement of the employee

leave and location of convalescence, if different than the home address.

message for their supervisor.
   (i)   Vacation leave may be used for sick leave purposes, at the employee's
request with the approval of the Hiring Authority, after sick leave is

comp-time must be requested as far in advance as possible of the day off
requested. Only one (1) employee of each shift of any depat1ment shall be
permitted to take off on either comp-time or vacation time. If an employee

comp-time prior to moving to that position.
   *Employees with in excess of 24 hours accrued comp-time as of the effective
date of this section will be permitted to obtain said comp-time, but may not

141.02 SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY, PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, AND RULE MAKING
AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Policy. It is the Village’s policy to provide safe, dependable and
efficient government services to the public. Village employees are a valuable
and important resource and it is therefore the Village's policy to provide a
healthy, safe, and satisfying working environment for duty. Federal laws and
regulations have been adopted which require the Village to implement a drug,
controlled substance, and alcohol screening program for operators of a
commercial motor vehicle and for employees who engage in certain safety
sensitive occupations. The Village has determined that this policy is best
enforced and imposed upon all employees. Accordingly, a requirement for
entering Village employment, retaining Village employment, or advancing in the
administrative service of the Village into positions including but not limited
to those to which the abovementioned Federal regulations apply shall henceforth
be that such an employee is fit for duty in the additional sense that he or she
is free of drug dependence, not a user of nor a trafficker in controlled
substances or drugs, and free of alcohol dependency or use such that his or her
normal mental or physical capabilities are not impaired. In meeting these
goals, it is further the Village’s policy to:
      (1)   Assure that covered employees operating a covered vehicle with or
without a commercial driver's license are fit for duty and able to perform
their assigned duties in a safe, productive, healthy, and unimpaired manner;
      (2)   Create a workplace free from the adverse effects of drug, alcohol,
and substance abuse;
      (3)   Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of alcohol, drugs or controlled substances, among persons
entrusted with covered vehicles or persons employed by the Village by contract
to engage in work involving the operation of a covered vehicle.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure that covered
employees, including those who operate covered vehicles, are fit for duty; to
eliminate, if possible, the risk to the Village posed by the use of alcohol,
drugs, and controlled substances by covered employees, including those
operating covered vehicles; and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol abuse,
controlled substance use or drug abuse. It is further the Village’s purpose to
detect, identify and remove from duty those covered employees who operate
covered vehicles when such employees should not be operating a covered vehicle
because they are not fit for duty, or who are working when they are unfit for
duty. However, it is not the purpose of this policy to warrant or to guarantee
to the public at large or other employees of the Village who are injured by a
covered employee that the Village has detected or will in every instance detect
that a violation of this policy has occurred before some injurious result
occurs, and it is not the purpose of this policy to create an express or
implied warranty on the part of the Village to the public at large or other
employees that all covered employees are free from alcohol abuse, drug misuse,
or controlled substance use.
   (c)   Applicability. This Chapter shall apply to covered employees when
going to or from work, when going to a work site, when preparing to perform
work at a site, when performing work for the Village, when on a break or at
lunch while in the course of performing work, after concluding the performance
of work at a site but before departing the work site, when returning to the
Village facilities following departure from a work site, and when on Village
property regardless of work status.
   (d)   Rulemaking Authority. The Administrator or his designee is hereby
authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as well as create forms,
documents, and procedures for the implementation of this Chapter and to enter
into contracts necessary for the implementation of this policy upon such terms
as may be agreed upon, subject to the approval of the Village legal advisor.
Such activities as are undertaken under authority of this subsection shall be
consistent with this Chapter and consistent with the relevant Federal laws and
regulations governing substance abuse testing as the same are applicable to the
Village.
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.03 SUBSTANCES FOR WHICH TEST IS TO BE CONDUCTED.
   Tests shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter for
alcohol, any controlled substance or drug as said terms are defined herein and
whose misuse or abuse is addressed in this Chapter.
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.04 GROUNDS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING.
   All covered employees shall be subject to substance abuse testing of either
urine, breath, and/or blood under the following circumstances:
   (a)   Pre-Employment or Pre-Promotion Testing. All applicants whose names
are certified or recommended for appointment or promotion to a position whose
incumbent would be a covered employee shall be notified by the Administrator
that a post-offer test for drug, alcohol and controlled substance use must
precede their appointment or promotion into covered employment. An applicant
who is tentatively selected for appointment or promotion by the appointing
authority and who then refuses, declines, or fails to submit to a drug, alcohol
and controlled substance test upon notice to do so by the Administrator shall
be deemed to be medically unqualified for covered employment and shall not be
appointed or promoted into covered employment. An applicant, who is selected
for appointment or promotion and is tested for drug, alcohol and controlled
substance use prior to appointment or promotion to covered employment, must
receive a satisfactory test result before he assumes the duties of his
position. All current full and part-time employees shall be tested in
accordance with policies adopted by the Administrator.
   (b)   Reasonable Suspicion Testing. Covered employees shall be subject to a
fitness for duty evaluation, which shall include appropriate urine, blood, and/
or breath testing when a supervisor has reasonable suspicion that controlled
substance use, drug abuse or alcohol use is adversely affecting a covered
employee's job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing shall
be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are
consistent with the long or short-term effects of substance abuse. "Reasonable
suspicion" means an apparent state of existing facts, circumstances or
information which result from an inquiry by the supervisor or from a credible
source which would induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent person to
reasonably believe the covered employee is under the influence of or using
controlled substances, drugs, or alcohol. Reasonable suspicion determinations
leading to a substance abuse test shall be made by a covered employee's
supervisor who shall be reasonably trained in the detection of the signs and
symptoms of substance abuse or who is reasonably familiar with the same, and
who reasonably concludes that a covered employee's work, mental faculties, or
physical capabilities are presently being impaired or affected by substance
abuse. Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-
the-job behavior for unexplained reasons;
      (2)   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
      (3)   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession,
or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited substances;
      (4)   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
      (5)   Fights (to mean physical contact), assault, menacing, stalking, or
threatening behavior, and flagrant disregard or violation of established
safety, security or other operating procedures.
Reasonable suspicion shall not be based solely upon a covered employee’s
possession of alcohol, particularly unopened containers of alcohol or
possession of alcohol by trained medical personnel for purposes of medical
treatment. Possession of alcohol with observations concerning the employee’s
appearance, speech, or abnormal conduct are necessary. Possession of a
controlled substance shall be reasonable suspicion for requiring a controlled
substance test. Possession of drugs shall not be grounds for a reasonable
suspicion test if the covered employee can: (1) satisfactorily explain to his
or her supervisor the reason for possession of the drug, (2) identify the
physician who prescribed the drug for the covered employee (this information
can be verified to the supervisor by the pharmacy filling the prescription or
the prescribing physician), and (3) the use of drugs has not affected or
impaired the employee's work performance. The fact a satisfactory explanation
is provided shall not negate reasonable suspicion if the covered employee's
mental or physical abilities appear to be affected or impaired by the drug.
Observations leading to a reasonable suspicion substance abuse test shall be
reduced to writing or otherwise preserved within a reasonable time by the
supervisor making the decision to require such a test.
Once a covered employee has been notified that a reasonable suspicion test will
be conducted, the test shall take place within two (2) hours of this notice. If
the test is not conducted within two hours, a written record shall be made
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If the test has not
been conducted within eight (8) hours following the notification, no test shall
be administered and a record shall be made of why the test was not administered
within eight (8) hours.
   (c)   Post-Accident Testing. All covered employees (including any employee
operating a covered vehicle despite not having a commercial drivers license)
shall be subject to urine, blood or breath testing when a covered vehicle is
involved in a collision or when control over a covered vehicle is unexplainably
(for non-mechanical reasons) lost. By way of illustration, but not limitation,
an unexplained loss of control of a covered vehicle or a collision between a
covered vehicle and a person that results in a fatality or injuries requiring
medical attention; a collision between a covered vehicle and another vehicle or
train resulting in material damage, a collision between a covered vehicle and a
stationary or moving object resulting in material damage shall be grounds for a
post accident substance abuse test.
Material damage for purposes of this subsection means damage estimated to be
equal to or greater than Four Hundred Dollars ($400). The determination of
whether material damage has occurred shall be made by a supervisor other than
one who was within the covered vehicle when the triggering event occurred or
witnessed that event.
The filing of criminal or traffic charges as a result of a triggering event
shall not be necessary to require a covered employee or a non-covered employee
operating a covered vehicle to submit to a post-accident test. Reasonable
suspicion that the operator of a covered vehicle involved in a triggering event
has used drugs, alcohol or controlled substances is immaterial to the
requirement herein of a post-accident test.
Post-accident testing shall not be permitted to delay the administration of
necessary medical attention to injured covered employees. Once a covered
employee has been notified that a post accident test will be conducted, it
shall take place within two (2) hours of this notice. If the test is not
conducted within two hours, a written record shall be made stating the reasons
the test was not promptly administered. If the test has not been conducted
within eight (8) hours following the notification, no test shall be
administered and a record shall be made of why the test was not administered
within eight (8) hours.
Covered employees or non-covered employees who operate a covered vehicle that
is involved in an accident resulting in material damage or in an unexplained
loss of control and who are so seriously injured that a substance abuse test
cannot be obtained within the requisite two (2) hour period shall execute a
medical consent form allowing an analysis of any adequate substitute bodily
fluids taken within two hours of the triggering event for the purposes of
medical treatment to be used for analysis for the purpose of substance abuse
testing (assuming scientifically reliable results can be obtained). Failure to
grant such consent when fluids capable of analysis exist shall cause the
employee to be deemed medically unqualified for duty such that a substance
abuse test is required before the covered employee may return to work.
The Village may, but shall not be required to, substitute, accept, and rely
upon the result of any blood, urine, or breath test conducted pursuant to
Ohio's implied consent statute as an accurate and reliable substance abuse test
for purposes of this Chapter provided the test is an accurate and reliable
means for testing for alcohol, drug and controlled substance abuse.
A covered employee or a non-covered employee who operates a covered vehicle
involved in an accident, unless injured so seriously that immediate medical
attention is required, must make his or her whereabouts known to his immediate
supervisor for purposes of remaining available for a possible substance abuse
test for the balance of the work day or eight hours after the accident,
whichever is later. A covered employee subject to test hereunder who cannot be
located following an accident for the balance of the work day or for eight
hours after the accident shall be deemed medically unqualified for duty and
shall not be permitted to return to work until he or she submits to a substance
abuse test.
   (d)   Random and Unannounced Testing. Covered employees shall be subjected
to random, unannounced urine, blood, and/or breath testing for the purpose of
detecting substance abuse. The process used for selection of a covered employee
(s) to take a substance abuse test shall be determined by the Administrator or
his designee; provided, however, that the selection process must yield a random
result so that no predictable pattern of identifying the covered employee to be
tested will exist, and provided further that random testing shall be conducted
on an intermittent schedule so that predictable time frames when tests will be
administered cannot be ascertained.
A covered employee randomly selected for an unannounced substance abuse test
shall immediately proceed to the designated sampling location to provide a test
sample. A covered employee who refuses or fails to travel to the collection
site or who refuses or fails to provide a test sample for substance abuse test
analysis within a reasonable time after being randomly selected for test shall
be deemed medically unqualified for employment and shall be relieved of duty
without pay until a sample is provided. Covered employees selected for testing
who are not at work when selected shall be passed over if they have been tested
within the previous 365 days, and otherwise shall be instructed to report for
testing immediately upon their return to work.
The number of random unannounced substance abuse tests conducted annually shall
equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the number of covered employee CDL
positions or such lesser percentage in each other pool as may be designated by
the Administrator, whether vacant or filled, in the administrative service of
the Village. Private contractors shall be subject to a similar number of tests
based on the number of covered employees they utilize under a contract with the
Village.
   (e)   Return-to-Duty Testing. All covered employees who previously received
an unsatisfactory result on a substance abuse test, including any second or
confirming test if one was conducted, must undergo return-to-duty substance
abuse testing before returning to work and be evaluated, and treated if
necessary, for substance abuse, and be released to duty by a competent medical
practitioner before returning to work. Covered employees who are subject to
return-to-duty testing shall also be subject to six or more random and
unannounced substance abuse tests, to be conducted when the covered employee is
at work, during the first 12 months following his or her re-entry into
employment separate and apart from their exposure to random and unannounced
testing. A successful return-to-duty test for alcohol shall be a result of 0.02
or less. A negative screen for drugs and controlled substances shall be
considered a successful test for return-to-duty purposes.
   (f)   Employee Requested Testing. Any employee who questions the results of
a substance abuse test required or administered pursuant to subsections (a)
through (e) hereof may request that a confirming test in addition to an initial
test be performed. This test may be conducted by the same or a different
testing facility, provided the facility is certified by DHHS to meet 29 CFR
Part 40 requirements. If possible, the testing shall be conducted with the same
specimen (on a split sample if such exists) that was originally submitted to
the Village's laboratory. All costs for tests requested by an employee are to
be paid for by the employee.
      (Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.05 SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING PROCEDURES AND DISCLOSURE.
   (a)   Substance abuse testing shall be conducted using test procedures and
analysis techniques that are designed to produce a scientifically accurate and
reliable result and efforts shall be made to utilize only laboratory facilities
which have been approved by the DHHS when it is reasonably possible to do so
without delaying the result of the test. Consistent with obtaining an accurate
and reliable result, the Village affirms the need to protect individual
dignity, privacy and confidentiality throughout the testing process. Personal
data regarding the drug testing program shall be released only to those persons
who have a bona fide need to know the information for proper administration of
the anti-drug program in accordance with 49 CFR § 40.81.
   (b)   For purposes of carrying out its substance abuse testing program for
drugs and controlled substances through urinalysis, the Village hereby adopts,
as if fully rewritten and incorporated here (including its appendices), the
provisions of 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 entitled “Procedures for
Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs” and more specifically
designated “Subpart B - Drug Testing”, as the same were promulgated effective
October 14, 1994, a copy of which is attached to Ordinance 95-4-33 and marked
"Exhibit A."
   (c)   For purposes of carrying out its substance abuse testing program for
alcohol by means of breath testing device for covered employees not covered by
Federal laws and regulations mandating the substance abuse testing of operators
of commercial motor vehicles, the Village of Sunbury hereby adopts, as if fully
rewritten and incorporated here (including its appendices), the provisions of
49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 entitled “Procedures for Transportation
Workplace Drug Testing Programs” and more specifically designated "Subpart C -
Alcohol Testing,” as the same were promulgated effective October 14, 1994, a
copy of which is attached to Ordinance 95-4-33 and marked "Exhibit A."
   (d)   For purposes of carrying out the substance abuse testing program
mandated by the United States government for commercial motor vehicles
operating in interstate commerce, the Village of Sunbury hereby adopts, as if
fully rewritten and incorporated here (including its appendices), the
provisions of 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 382 entitled “Controlled
Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing" and more specifically designated
"Subpart A - General," "Subpart B - Prohibitions," “Subpart C - Tests
Required," "Subpart D - Handling of Test Results, Record Retention and
Confidentiality," and “Subpart F - Alcohol Misuse and Controlled Substance Use
Information, Training and Referral,” as the same were promulgated effective
October 14, 1994, a copy of which is attached to Ordinance 95-4-33 and marked
"Exhibit B."
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.06 EFFECTS OF REFUSAL OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST SAMPLE AND
UNSATISFACTORY SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST RESULTS.
   (a)   Any covered employee who is subject to a substance abuse test under
this Chapter and who is informed, orally or in writing, to submit to a
substance abuse test shall provide a sample adequate for initial and confirming
substance abuse testing. Samples which are provided in an acceptable fashion
and to an appropriate container at the testing facility, which sample(s) are
then lost, lost by breakage, misplaced, mislabeled, mishandled, or contaminated
by the testing facility or its employees so as to be scientifically unreliable
shall nevertheless be deemed to be a sample.
   (b)   Refusal or failure to provide a sample adequate for initial and
confirming testing within a reasonable time, or the refusal or failure of a
covered employee who is notified to provide a substance abuse test sample to
immediately appear for testing, shall cause the covered employee to be deemed
medically unfit for duty and to be relieved of duty without pay.
   (c)   If a substance abuse test indicates the presence of controlled
substances, drugs, or an impermissible level of alcohol in the covered
employees system, the employee shall be deemed medically unfit for duty, he or
she shall be relieved of duty, and he or she shall be subject to disciplinary
action.
   The Administrator and/or Appointing Authority shall retain authority to
impose disciplinary sanctions deemed appropriate under each circumstance.
Ordinarily, but not necessarily, the failure or refusal to submit an adequate
sample shall be grounds for immediate termination. If a substance abuse test
indicates the presence of controlled substances, drugs or an impermissible
level of alcohol in the employee’s system, the employee may be eligible to
enter the Village’s Last Chance Program which may, but need not necessarily,
include leave of absence without pay and/or treatment, following execution by
the offending employee of the Last Chance Agreement. Second offense failures to
submit to testing, or the detection of the presence of controlled substances,
drugs or impermissible levels of alcohol in the employees system shall subject
the covered employee to termination from Village employment or exclusion from
work on Village projects.
 
   (d)   No covered employee shall be permitted to perform safety-sensitive
function or engage in the operation of a vehicle whose operation requires a
CDL: (1) when test results indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or
greater, (2) within four hours after using alcohol, (3) while using alcohol on
the job, (4) during the eight (8) hours following an accident if the covered
employee's involvement has not been discounted as a contributing factor in the
accident or until the covered employee is tested for substance abuse and
achieves a satisfactory result, or (5) if the covered employee refuses to
submit to required substance abuse tests. Any covered employee who violates any
of these prohibitions shall be removed from safety sensitive functions until he
or she has met the conditions for returning to a safety sensitive function by
providing a satisfactory test. If a covered employee is found to have an
alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 or if the covered
employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as indicated by
behavior, speech and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, and a reasonable
suspicion alcohol test result cannot be obtained, the covered employee will
have to be removed from safety sensitive duties for eight (8) hours or until a
test result below 0.02 is obtained.
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.07 CONDITIONS FOR RETURN TO EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING A POSITIVE TEST.
   Covered employees who re-enter the service of the Village or return to
private employment on a project undertaken by the Village following an
unsatisfactory substance abuse test result shall be subject to the conditions
which may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (a)   A release to work statement for an approved treatment specialist;
   (b)   A negative return to duty test for drugs, controlled substances and/or
alcohol;
   (c)   An agreement to periodic testing for one year;
   (d)   A statement of expected work-related behavior; and
   (e)   An agreement to follow specified after care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for further
discipline.
      (Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.08 RULES FOR VILLAGE CONTRACTORS.
   Private parties employed by the Village to engage in activities which will
extend over ninety (90) or more days in a three hundred and sixty-five
consecutive day period and involve activities for which the Federal regulations
require substance abuse testing, private employers who employ persons who
provide safety sensitive functions for the Village, and private employers who
are contractually engaged by the Village to operate vehicles which require the
operator of the vehicle to possess a CDL shall adopt an anti-drug policy which
contains the same provisions as this Chapter with respect to prohibited conduct
and substance abuse testing. No contractor's employee who is in violation of
this Chapter may be employed on Village property or operate a vehicle whose
operator must possess a CDL on a Village contracted project. Private employers
under contract with the Village which subjects its employees to substance abuse
testing may, at the sole discretion of the Village and at the contractor's
expense, participate in the Village’s substance abuse testing program, with the
test results being referred to the contractor's management for appropriate
personnel action.
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.09 GENERAL RULES AND PROHIBITIONS RESPECTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE INVOLVING
VILLAGE PROPERTY OR PREMISES.
   (a)   No employee in the administrative service of the Village shall ingest,
take or use, and employees in the administrative service of the Village shall
be disciplined for ingesting, taking, or using any prescription drug or
controlled substance unless prescribed by a person licensed to practice
medicine.
   (b)   Employees who are required to take prescription medicine which could
affect their fitness for duty shall notify their immediate supervisor of the
medication prescribed and present proof of possession of a prescription for the
same.
   (c)   Any statutory defined illegal activity by an employee in the service
of the Village or an employee of a contractor of the Village involving drugs,
controlled substances or alcohol by an employee, whether during or outside
Village employment, shall be grounds for discipline.
   (d)   All Village property shall be subject to inspection at any time
without notice. Property includes, but is not limited to Village-owned
vehicles, desks, containers, files and storage lockers.
   (e)   An employee who believes that another employee is using drugs or
controlled substances or alcohol in violation of this Chapter, in an illegal
fashion, or is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol
shall report the same immediately to his or her supervisor and those who do not
report such facts and circumstances immediately to their supervisor shall
themselves be subject to discipline for neglect of duty.
   (f)   Refusal of a covered employee to take a drug test provided for by this
Chapter shall result in immediate suspension from Village service without pay
pending disciplinary action if the supervisor observes what appear to be the
characteristics of drug misuse, controlled substance use, or alcohol misuse.
(Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
141.10 SATISFACTORY SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEST RESULT.
   A satisfactory result shall be considered to be a negative drug and/or
substance abuse test, whether such test be initial or conforming. A
satisfactory alcohol test shall be considered to be a breath alcohol level of
0.02 or less. A breath alcohol test which is 0.04 or less shall not be
disqualifying if the applicant, at a time randomly selected by the
Administrator within the next seventy-two hours, provides a satisfactory breath
test of 0.02 or less on an identical test device. An unsatisfactory result
shall be considered a test result other than as described above or an
inexcusable failure or refusal to provide a substance abuse test sample. An
employee or an applicant for employment may present a current prescription for
a drug as justification for any positive drug test result and be considered to
have obtained a satisfactory result, provided the dosage prescribed is not
deemed to be of such a nature as to impair the applicant’s faculties if taken
as prescribed. (Ord. 96-007. Passed 3-6-96.)
CHAPTER 143
Public Records Policy
143.01   Definitions.
143.02   Availability.
143.03   Requests for records; guidelines.
143.04   Charges for public records.
143.05   Documents in electronic format.
143.06   Failure to respond to requests.
143.01 DEFINITIONS.
   This Village, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records as
including the following: Any document - paper, electronic (including, but not
limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or received by, or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of
the office. All records of the Village of Sunbury are public unless they are
specifically exempt from disclosure under the applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-08.)
143.02 AVAILABILITY.
   It is the policy of the Village of Sunbury that, as required by Ohio law,
records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (See Section
143.05 regarding setting forth the e-mail policy). Record retention schedules
are to be updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-08.)
143.03 REQUESTS FOR RECORDS; GUIDELINES.
   Each request for public records shall be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public records. It is the Village’s general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. If more copies requested, an
appointment should be made with the requester or when the copies or computer
files can be picked up. All requests for public records must either be
satisfied (see above in this subsection (d)) or be acknowledged in writing by
the Village of Sunbury within three business days following the office’s
receipt of the request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine,”
such as seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research,
the acknowledgment must include the following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
      (4)   The maximum amount of public records requests available to a person
or entity requesting transmission by United States mail is 10 per calendar
month unless the person or entity certifies to the Village of Sunbury in
writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the requested
records, or the information contained in them for commercial purposes. For
purposes of this section, “commercial” shall be narrowly construed and, does
not include report or gathering news, reporting or gathering information to
assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or activities of
government, or non-profit education research.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority. (Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-08.)
143.04 CHARGES FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is 5 cents per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded files to a compact disc is $1.00 per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-08.)
143.05 DOCUMENTS IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the Village. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Sections
143.01 and
143.02) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to the
office’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act. (Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-
08.)
143.06 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS.
   The Village of Sunbury recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, (the public office’s)
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the Village of
Sunbury to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney’s fees and
damages. (Ord. 2008-06. Passed 3-19-08.)
TITLE FIVE - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.
171.01   Magistrate.
171.02   Reimbursement for incarceration costs.

professional requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and Mayor’s Court Rule 3 of
the Mayor’s Court Education and Procedure Rules.
   (b)   A Mayor’s Court Magistrate appointed by the Mayor pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 1905.05 shall be compensated in an amount not to exceed two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per session of Mayor’s Court attended and held by the
Magistrate, said compensation to be paid as on a contractual basis without
further benefit from the Village of Sunbury to the Magistrate.
(Ord. 97-010. Passed 2-19-97.)
171.02 REIMBURSEMENT FOR INCARCERATION COSTS.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense under the Village of Sunbury
Codified Ordinances which results in such person’s incarceration shall pay to
the Village the actual cost incurred by the Village in housing such person in a
jail facility. Such costs shall include pre- conviction and post-conviction
incarceration.
   (b)   The Mayor, if presiding over Mayor’s Court, or if the Mayor’s Court
Magistrate appointed by the Mayor to preside over Mayor’s Court, may waive all
or part of the incarceration costs where, because of the indigence of the
person sentenced, the payment of costs would work an unreasonable hardship on
the person convicted, his or her immediate family or any other person who is
dependent on such individual for financial support, or for such other reason as
the Mayor or the Mayor’s Court Magistrate may deem appropriate.
   (c)   In the event of non-payment of costs which have not been waived, the
Village may seek to collect payment in any manner permitted by law for the
enforcement of a debt.

      (3)   A.    On the portion attributable to Sunbury of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter of all resident
unincorporated businesses, professions or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done, services performed or rendered and business or other

         B.    On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter of a resident partner or
owner of a resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to Sunbury
and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
      (4)   A.    On the portion attributable to Sunbury of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this chapter of all non-residents
unincorporated business, professions or other entities, derived from sales
made, work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in Sunbury whether or not such unincorporated business
entity has an office or place of business in Sunbury.
         B.    On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits

   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to Sunbury of a taxpayer
conducting a business, profession or other activity both within and without the
boundaries of Sunbury shall be determined as provided in Ohio R.C. 718.02.
   (c)   If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year, such
losses may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns. In the case of a corporation that carried on
transactions with its stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any
person operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity
within Sunbury constituting a portion only of its total business the Director
shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to Sunbury. If the Director finds
net profits are not properly allocated to Sunbury by reason of transactions
with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division, branch, factory,

profit which is attributable to that part of the business conducted within
Sunbury, then only that portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs
in Sunbury for purposes of being taxable and taxed by Sunbury. Absent such
records, net profit from a business conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Sunbury shall be conclusively presumed to have a taxable situs in
Sunbury for purposes of being taxable and taxed by Sunbury in the same
proportion as the average, the means of determining which is hereinbelow
described:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real property and the tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business in Sunbury
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
property and tangible personal property owned or used both by the taxpayer in
the business during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this
subsection, "real property" included property rented or leased by the taxpayer
and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual
rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business for services performed in Sunbury,
to wages, salaries, or other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business, wherever their services are performed;
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business from sales made and services
performed during the taxable period in Sunbury to gross receipts of the
business during the same period from sales and service wherever made or
performed.
   (g)   In the event the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
by the Director or his delegate in order to produce such equitable result.
   (h)   As used in this chapter, "Sales made in Sunbury" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
Sunbury regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within Sunbury.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
Sunbury, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a point
outside Sunbury if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within Sunbury and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within Sunbury to purchaser or purchasers outside Sunbury, regardless of
where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.

181.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer who engages in business or whose salaries, wages,
commissions, rents, gambling or gaming winnings, lottery winnings, tips,
gratuities, money or anything of value gained or acquired as a result of
illegal activities and/or other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return
(also known as a Sunbury Income Tax Return) with the office of the Director on
a form furnished by or obtainable from the office of the Director on or before
April 30 of each year, setting forth the aggregate amount of salaries, wages,
commissions, rents, gambling or gaming winnings, lottery winnings, tips,
gratuities, money or the value of anything gained or acquired as a result of
illegal activities, and/or other compensation earned and/or net profits earned
and/or gross income from any business less allowable expenses in the
acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject
to the tax, together with such other pertinent information as the Director may
require. Each person who resides in Sunbury who is eighteen years of age or
older, shall file the return as set forth in this section. When the return is
made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the
return shall be filed within four months from the end of such fiscal year or
other period. The Director is hereby authorized to provide that the return to
an employer, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer from the
salary, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation pay or other compensation of an
employee and paid by the employer to the Director shall be accepted as the
return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this
chapter is such salary, wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation pay or other
compensation. A husband and wife, in any tax year, may elect to file separate
or joint returns. Each resident of Sunbury who does not make and file an annual
income tax return shall make and file an annual exemption certificate on the
form prescribed by the Director; this exemption certificate shall be filed on
or before the fifteenth day of May of each year; each resident who is required
to file an annual exemption certificate and who violates this requirement shall
be subject to a fine of ten dollars ($10.00) for each violation; the fine shall
be separate for each day the person remains and is in violation. Each taxpayer
who does not file an annual return as required herein shall be liable for a
penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each year or portion thereof that
the annual return is not filed, until filed and the penalty paid in full.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Director on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Director setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions, rents and
other compensation, including but not limited to vacation pay, accrued benefits
and bonuses earned and/or net profits earned and/or gross income from such
business less allowable expenses in the acquisition of such gross income earned
during the preceding year and subject to the tax, together with such other
pertinent information as the Director may require. When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, however, the
return shall be made on or before the last day of the fourth month after the
close of such fiscal year or other period.
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Director may require.
      (4)   Each taxpayer who resides within Sunbury is accountable for taxes
on all his or her income whether earned in or out of Sunbury.
A nonresident's income is only subject to the Sunbury Income Tax to the extent
that income was earned within Sunbury and therefore the taxpayer can deduct
only those losses by his or her business within Sunbury.
These same provisions shall apply to joint returns filed by husband and wife.
      (5)   The election amount taken as IRS Section 179 expense (or any
amendment thereto) is not an allowable deduction for corporations or
partnerships against income subject to tax under this chapter.
      (6)   No deduction is permitted against income subject to tax under this
chapter for any Form 1040, Schedule A itemized deduction.
   (c)   The Director may extend the time for filing of the annual return upon
the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or one
month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return. All requests for an
extension of time to file an annual return shall be in writing and filed with
the Director by April 30. Requests for extensions shall be accompanied by
copies of the federal extension form where a federal extension has been
requested. In addition, the request for extension shall also be accompanied
with a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to
be due thereon. Requests for extension of the time to file an annual return
does not extend the time required to file quarterly estimated returns. No
penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the annual return
is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (d)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Director the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06 of this chapter, or where any portion of the tax shall have been paid by
the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality credit for
the amount so paid in accordance with Section
181.14 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which Sunbury is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided further
that no amount of less than one dollar ($1.00) will be refunded or collected.
   (e)   (1)   Amended Returns. Where necessary an amended return must be filed
in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim
or refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations
contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Director. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment
or net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Sunbury tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Sunbury return showing income subject to the Sunbury
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
      (3)   Within thirty days of receiving a tax refund from another
municipality for which credit has been claimed on a taxpayer's Sunbury return,
as permitted by Section
181.14, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended Sunbury return and pay any
additional tax shown thereon. No refund shall be allowed unless a written
request is presented to the Director or his delegate within three years of the
date the taxes were due.
   (f)   (1)   Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December
31, 1995 the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used
to offset salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation. However, if a
taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity
(except any portion of a loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity) may be used to offset the profits of the other
unincorporated business activity(ies) for purposes of arriving at overall net
profits.
      (2)   A nonresident's income is only subject to the Sunbury income tax to
the extent it was earned within Sunbury.
   (g)   Affiliated corporations may not deduct a loss from any other
corporation having a taxable profit and operations of any affiliated
corporation having a loss may not be taken into consideration in computing net
profits or business allocation percentage formula.
   (h)   A taxpayer who pays their business expenses from their commissions or
other compensation, without reimbursement from their employer, may deduct from
their gross commissions or other compensation business expenses allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for Federal Income Tax purposes, but only to the
extent that such expenses are incurred in earning commissions or other
compensation subject to the tax imposed by this section.
(Ord. 98-032. Passed 10-21-98.)

Director, showing the amounts of tax deducted by the employer from the

         (b)   "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for

then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Sunbury each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)   "Refundable credit" means the amount of Sunbury income tax that
was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to Sunbury, a taxpayer has paid tax to other

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to Sunbury
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

part of the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Sunbury

employed.
                   (h)   The location of educational institutions attended by
the individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue

on the residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)   The number of contact periods the individual has with Sunbury.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact period" with

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Sunbury during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Sunbury to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the

are not required to be withheld under Section
182.04 (C);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Sunbury to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Sunbury, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Sunbury may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion

one or more of the following:
            (i)   Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.12 (A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within Sunbury from a
stock of goods located within Sunbury.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within Sunbury from a location

tangible personal property is used in Sunbury.

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Sunbury's tax only if the property
generating the net profit is located in Sunbury or if the individual taxpayer
that receives the net profit is a resident of Sunbury. Sunbury shall allow such
taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating
net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation in which
the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of Sunbury shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's

section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the

   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Sunbury shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Sunbury. Except for qualifying wages
for which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.01(B)(1) of this chapter, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date
that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Sunbury the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Sunbury in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Sunbury in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
      Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Sunbury. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Sunbury as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Sunbury income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Sunbury the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Sunbury income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Sunbury until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Sunbury during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;

withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Sunbury income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section. (Ord. 2017-35. Passed 12-20-17.)

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)

year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in Sunbury.

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Sunbury only if
the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the
employer in Sunbury than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For
the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
         (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Sunbury exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to Sunbury for any subsequent days in that calendar year
on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in Sunbury.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Sunbury under
division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for Sunbury for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in Sunbury.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Sunbury and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Sunbury, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of Sunbury.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements

corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040, or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio Form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Sunbury to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to Sunbury . No remittance is
required if the net amount s due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not

on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Sunbury. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Sunbury's income tax
return. The extended due date of Sunbury's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Sunbury's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Sunbury income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date Sunbury
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Sunbury's income tax return. The extended due date of Sunbury's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Sunbury, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Sunbury shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Sunbury for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Sunbury an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Sunbury income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with Sunbury for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in Section
182.04(C)(1)(g)) within Sunbury.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in Sunbury and does
not expect to be subject to Sunbury income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Sunbury. The affidavit shall also include the
following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
Sunbury, make any sales in Sunbury or otherwise become subject to the tax
levied by Sunbury during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject
to the tax levied by Sunbury for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be
considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with Sunbury income
tax ordinance and rules and regulations”. The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for Sunbury by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
182.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Sunbury, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Sunbury and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by Sunbury to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Sunbury, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Sunbury
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of Sunbury's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents. (Ord. 2017-35. Passed 12-20-17.)

Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Sunbury for

payment of taxes required by Sunbury during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Sunbury's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Sunbury income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to Sunbury. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated Sunbury
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Sunbury income
tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Sunbury income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Sunbury income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Sunbury. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Sunbury. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Sunbury;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Sunbury income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Sunbury income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Sunbury income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Sunbury in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Sunbury before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Sunbury may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for Sunbury from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to Sunbury in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax

year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
182.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Sunbury under Section
182.04 for that year.
       (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Sunbury but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year. (Ord. 2017-35. Passed 12-20-17.)

included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.10    SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Sunbury, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Sunbury as a refund but is
subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Sunbury is subject to recovery by Sunbury. If
Sunbury's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Sunbury shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Sunbury claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If Sunbury's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Sunbury's
tax rate. However, if Sunbury's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the
other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be
paid to Sunbury, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the
period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.11    AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Sunbury changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state
income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with Sunbury. The
amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
Section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Sunbury. A request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Sunbury's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Sunbury return showing income subject to Sunbury
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Sunbury income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.12    LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Sunbury does not prejudice any claim
for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Sunbury income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.13    AUDITS. 
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-29.
Passed 11-4-15.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Sunbury official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Sunbury
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.15    ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Sunbury that arises pursuant to Sunbury's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.16    TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Sunbury as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit Sunbury from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 11-4-15.)
182.17    FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Sunbury ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud Sunbury or the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 2015-29. Passed
11-4-15.)
182.18    INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Applicable law" means this chapter, the resolutions, ordinances,

July of the year in which the federal short-term rate is determined in
accordance with division (A)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or Sunbury
by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer pursuant
to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.
      (6)   "Unpaid estimated income tax" means estimated income tax due but
not paid by the date the tax is required to be paid under applicable law.

agent, or other payer is required to withhold from an employee's qualifying
wages.
   (B)   (1)   This section applies to the following:

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Sunbury on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Sunbury to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with Sunbury any return required to be filed, the following penalties

penalty, amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that Sunbury has
properly imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.
   (E)   Nothing in this section limits the authority of Sunbury to abate or

(Ord. 2017-35. Passed 12-20-17.)
182.19    AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Sunbury's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
182.03;

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
182.04.
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   (B)   (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Sunbury or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security

182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.02   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs
of the Village for use in the General Fund of the Village, an excise tax of
three percent is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or
transient accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests, pursuant
to R.C. § 5739.08(A).
   (b)   The above levy is separate and distinct from any hotel/motel excise
taxes which may be levied by the County of Delaware, Ohio.
   (c)   The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is
furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply
to lodging furnished to the state, or any of its political subdivisions, or any
charitable organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals.
   (d)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels or transient accommodations in this Village to transient guests is
subject to tax until the contrary is established.
   (e)   All revenues generated by the provisions of this chapter shall be
deposited into the Village's general revenue fund to be appropriated by the
Village Council for any lawful purpose.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.03   TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
statement specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no statement is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.04   REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Fiscal Officer shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed itself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Fiscal Officer, the Fiscal Officer
shall refund to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the
Fiscal Officer on the form prescribed by the Fiscal Officer, within ninety days
from the date it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or
erroneous. However, in any event such application for refund must be filed with
the Fiscal Officer within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous
payment of the tax. On filing of such application the Fiscal Officer shall
determine the amount of refund due and draw a warrant for such amount to the
person claiming such refund. The Fiscal Officer shall make such payments from a
Tax Refund Account, which is hereby established.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.05   REQUIRED RECORDS: INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodgings furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Fiscal Officer and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Fiscal Officer, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.06   RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall file a monthly return on forms prescribed by the Fiscal
Officer showing receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from
the vendor to the Village for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Fiscal Officer deems necessary for the proper administration
of this chapter. The monthly return is due on or before the fifteenth day of
each month during a calendar year. The Fiscal Officer may extend the time for
making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the
Fiscal Officer, together with payment of the amount of tax shown to be due
thereon. The Fiscal Officer shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the
date received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the
amount of payment received with the return. If the Fiscal Officer deems it
necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter,
the Fiscal Officer may require returns and payments to be made for other than
monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or his authorized
agent.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.07   LIABILITY: ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT: PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the Village as prescribed, such vendor shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which such vendor failed to remit.
The Fiscal Officer may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any
information in the Fiscal Officer's possession. If any vendor fails to collect
the tax or any transient guest fails to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to
this chapter on any transaction subject to the tax, such vendor or transient
guest shall be personally liable for the amount of the tax applicable to the
transaction. The Fiscal Officer may make an assessment against either the
vendor or transient guest, as the facts may require, based upon any information
in his possession. An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax
imposed by or pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall
not discharge the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the
tax applicable to such transaction.
   (b)   In each case the Fiscal Officer shall give to the vendor or transient
guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served
upon the vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if said tax has actually been
paid by another.
   (c)   The Fiscal Officer may make an assessment against any vendor who fails
to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount
of tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of
the Fiscal Officer indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or
should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Fiscal Officer
may upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business for a representative
period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which the tax required
to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or transient
accommodations' lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an
assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall
be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom said notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail a petition in writing, verified
under oath by said vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent, having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of said
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, said
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guests so assessed, to the Fiscal
Officer, Village of Sunbury, Ohio. When a petition for reassessment is filed,
the Fiscal Officer shall assign a time and place for the hearing of same and
shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered or certified mail, but the
Fiscal Officer may continue the hearings from time to time if necessary.
   (e)   A penalty of twenty percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Fiscal Officer may adopt and promulgate
rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to
assessments made under this chapter.
   (f)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Fiscal Officer,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days
after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.08   FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Fiscal Officer has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes
collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not returned to
the Village;
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.09   TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST: FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.10   VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX: PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transit guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that such vendor is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the
transient guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price
including the tax, or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.11   REPORTS MUST BE FILED: FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Fiscal Officer to file returns at less frequent
intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Fiscal Officer
may require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the average
tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by the
Fiscal Officer from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such
vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one thousand dollars
($1,000). The security may be in the form of a payment to be applied to pay the
tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the
Fiscal Officer, conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the returns from
the vendor. The security must be filed within ten days following the vendor's
receipt of the notice from the Fiscal Officer of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.12   PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the Village under the provisions of the chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers charged with the responsibility of
filing returns and making payments, shall be personally liable for such
failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or
remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by assessment in
the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.13   INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent on
transactions by which lodging by a hotel/motel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as referred to authorized by R.C. § 5739.08(A). Accordingly,
this chapter shall be construed to effectuate those purposes and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 2019-42. Passed 1-27-20.)
183.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a minor

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
         F.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (a)(1) of
this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
         B.   It is well- lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section. The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this section, subject to division (c) of this
section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to this division (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (b) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one- half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow- away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (b) of this section, a
towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs as
necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property in
violation of a private tow- away zone established under division (a) of this
section. The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs
taken under this section. The towing service shall retain the photographs and
the record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least 30
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(a) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation
shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private property in the
chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away zone of which
the chief has received notice under this section. The record shall include all
information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to a person
who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the
owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause

owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
         A.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
         B.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to owner and
lienholder information.
      (2)   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
      (3)   Subject to division (f)(6) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first notice
is sent, in the manner required under division (f)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (f)(3) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (5)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under R.C. § 4505.101(B).

            2.   If notice has been sent to the owner and lienholder as
described in division (f) of this section, a processing fee of $25.
      (2)   A towing service or storage facility in possession of a vehicle
that is removed under authority of division (b) of this section shall show the
vehicle owner, operator, or lienholder who contests the removal of the vehicle
all photographs taken under division (d) of this section. Upon request, the
towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all photographs in
the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper, electronic, or
otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (b) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. The
owner of the vehicle shall not retrieve any personal items from a vehicle if it

waiver of liability. For purposes of this division (g)(4) of this section,
“personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any vehicle from
private property that is established as a private tow- away zone under this
section or store such a vehicle other than in accordance with this section, or

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72 hours

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (a), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61 and
4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the municipality
from the disposal.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   (1)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any
motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is
left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours
with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
      (2)   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property;
except that such person having such permission shall conceal, by means of
buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

violation and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00), the court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the
additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course described in
subsection (b)(1) of this section. If the offender elects the course option and
attends and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued
written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do

way traffic control operation or otherwise significantly affects the progress
of traffic on arterial, collector or other roadways that the Chief of Police
identifies or decides that the public safety is at risk within the municipal
boundaries of the Village shall require traffic control, which shall be
performed under a permit by the Chief of Police. All temporary traffic control
methods and devices shall be in accordance with the latest edition of Ohio

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

313.07 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to

those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the

all times on all portions of freeways in congested areas as determined by the
Director and that are part of the interstate system and are located within a
municipal corporation or within an interstate freeway outerbelt;

subsection (d) hereof. No person shall be convicted of more than one violation
of this section for the same conduct, although violations of more than one
provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a single
affidavit.
   (d)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a street or highway as

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the

lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs. It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar under
R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under R.C.
Chapter 4506. Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
this division is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to R.C. §§
2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail
term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the
offender may be fined up to $1,000; and, notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3),
the offender may be ordered pursuant to R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of
community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying
case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall receive a driver’s license, or a motorcycle
operator’s endorsement of a driver’s or commercial driver’s license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card unless and until the person
surrenders to the Registrar or a deputy registrar all valid licenses, temporary
instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.

instruction permit, or identification card at any time.

traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:

of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking

legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.

directions on the meter. Such person is not required to deposit coin in a meter
which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the previous
occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not exceed
the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be lawfully
occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time shown on the
meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established maximum time
limit.
   No person shall fail to comply with directions displayed on the parking
meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a meter space

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance

exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this

evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of

violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
         (R.C. § 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
R.C. § 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this
division (a) and, if the offender is being sentenced for a criminal offense as
defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall sentence the offender to make restitution
pursuant to this division (a) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its
discretion or as required by this division (a), imposes one or more financial
sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this
division (a) include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Restitution.
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 and unless another
term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to
impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall
impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:

      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
   (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

division, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

duties.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing official
business. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (b), obstructing
official business is a misdemeanor of the second degree. If a violation of this
section creates a risk of physical harm to any person, obstructing official
business is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated a
delinquent child for committing the crime or act the person or child aided

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

property with another principal use, the Applicant shall present documentation
that the owner of the property supports the application and that the vehicular
access is provided to the facility.
      (3)   The Applicant shall present a site/landscaping plan showing the
specific placement of the Wireless Telecommunications Facilities on the site;
showing the location of existing structures, trees, and other significant site
features; and indicating type and locations of plant materials used to screen
the facilities and the proposed color of the facilities.
      (4)   Applicant shall present a signed statement indicating:
         A.   The Applicant agrees to allow for the potential co-location of
additional Wireless Telecommunications Facilities by other providers on the
Applicant's structure or within the same site location; and

technically suitable space reasonably available on an existing Tower or
structure within the geographic area to be served. With the permit application,
the applicant shall list the location of every Tower, building, or structure
within such area that could support the proposed antenna. The Applicant must
demonstrate that a technically suitable location is not reasonably available on
an existing Tower, building or structure. If another communication Tower is

Inspector and be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within 180
days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If reactivation or dismantling does
not occur, the municipality will remove or will contract to have removed the
facility and assess the owner/operator the costs.
   (b)   The Village must provide the Tower owner three (3) months notice and
an opportunity to be heard before the Planning and Zoning Commission before
initiating removal. After such notice has been provided, the Village shall have
the authority to initiate proceedings to either acquire the Tower and any
appurtenances attached thereto at the then fair market value, or in the
alternative, order the demolition of the Tower and all appurtenances.
   (c)   The Village shall provide the Tower owner with the right to a public
hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission, which public hearing shall
follow the three (3) month notice required in subsection (b) hereof. All
interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at the public
hearing.
   (d)   After a public hearing is held pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may order the acquisition or demolition of the

729.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT. 1
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Section 715.55 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Sunbury Village Council makes the following statement of
intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of the Village of Sunbury in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees
of the businesses as well as the citizens of the Village of Sunbury.
      (2)   The Sunbury Village Council finds that adult entertainment
establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the Village of Sunbury that demands reasonable regulation of
adult entertainment establishments by the Village of Sunbury in the specified
manner, and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment
establishments by local governments, in order to protect the health and well-
being of the citizens.
                                                           
 
1 This section is modified from the purpose and intent version included in
House Bill No. 23 (2006) and Senate Bill No. 16 (2007). It is placed here to
maintain consistency with the enacting legislation.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by the Village of Sunbury are a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of
adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to
ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as
places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   The Sunbury Village Council desires to minimize and control these
adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the
specified manner, and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the
Sunbury Village Council seeks to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; reserve the quality of
life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods;
and deter the spread of urban blight.
      (7)   The Sunbury Village Council has determined that current local
zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the people of the Village of Sunbury and that
expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of the Sunbury Village Council in enacting
this act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities
protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that
address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of the Sunbury Village Council to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the Sunbury Village
Council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of
obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to
enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this
State.
 
   (b)    It is the intent of the Sunbury Village Council in enacting this
chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establislm1ents
in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of the Village of Sunbury and establish reasonable regulations to
prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments
within the Village of Sunbury. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent of the Sunbury Village Council in enacting this chapter to
restrict or deny, or authorize the restriction or denial of, access by adults
to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or
authorize the denial of, access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult
entertainment and adult materials to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of the Sunbury Village Council in enacting this Ordinance to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material.
 
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in repmis made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ollio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other

Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gwy (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
the Sunbury Village Council's independent review of the same) the Sunbury
Village Council finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments.
      (2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The “couch dances” or “lap dances”that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of “engaging in prostitution” under Section 2907.25 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused b the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) in the United States; 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984,
8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the State.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982,
and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.

revokes a new or renewal license under this chapter, the applicant may pursue
an appeal to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Revised Code
Chapter 2506. The failure of the Sunbury Village Council to render a decision
on the application within the time prescribed in Section
729.09(a) shall be considered an affirmance of the denial, suspension, or
revocation of the license and the applicant may pursue an appeal to the
Delaware County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506. This
appeal provision is intended to comply with the requirement for prompt judicial
review stated by the United States Supreme Court in Township of Littleton,
Colorado v. Z. J. Gifts D-4 (2004), 541 U.S. 774.
 
   (b)   Any licensee lawfully operating a sexually oriented business prior to
the denial of a license renewal application, or the suspension or revocation of
a license, shall retain said license and all privileges attendant thereto,
subject to all other terms of this chapter, so that the status quo of the
licensee is maintained during the pendency of an appeal to the Delaware County
Court of Common Pleas of a decision rendered under this chapter and during the
entire time required for the court to rule on the appeal.
 
   (c)   Any licensee lawfully acting as an employee in a sexually oriented
business prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, shall retain said license and all
privileges attendant thereto, subject to all other terms of this chapter, so
that the status quo of the licensee is maintained during the pendency of an
appeal to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas of a decision rendered
under this chapter and during the entire time required for the court to rule on
the appeal.
 
   (d)   In the event that any judicial review of the denial of a new or
renewal license application or the revocation or suspension of a license is
still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of any license, the
licensee may file a renewal license application with the Sunbury Village
Council or its designee pursuant to this chapter. In the event that an
application for renewal of a license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial
review of that denial, the Village of Sunbury has the right to consolidate such
review with any pending judicial actions in regards to the previous denial,
suspension or revocation of a license.
 
   (e)   If, during the pendency of any appeal pursued under subsection (b)
above, there are additional denials of a renewal license application or
suspensions or revocations of that license, the Village of Sunbury has the
right to consolidate the appeal pursued under Section
729.11(b) for the additional denials, suspensions or revocations with any
pending appeal for that same licensee.

      (3)   Water pocketing;
      (4)   Stumbling blocks; and
      (5)   Slipperiness.
   These criteria shall be used singly or in combination to determine if
defects warrant repair or replacement of sidewalks.
   (b)   Laying of Concrete.
      (1)   Concrete shall be placed on an even, compact subgrade surface that
is free of soft, spongy earth, vegetable or other perishable matter. The
subgrade shall be damp to prevent loss of moisture. If the subgrade is dry, it
shall be sprinkled well in advance of placing concrete.
      (2)   The concrete shall be well compacted or vibrated so as to be
thoroughly worked into all corners, joints and form surfaces.
      (3)   Forms shall be set true to line and grade and well supported so
that no shifting, sagging, twisting or bending may occur.
      (4)   Forms shall be coated with approved form oil immediately prior to
placing concrete. Forms shall be removed with care so as to cause no damage to
the edges of concrete.
      (5)   No concrete shall be placed until the forms have been approved by
the inspector as to line and grade, and the other above-listed requirements
met.
   (c)   Finishing. Finishing shall be done with a wood float after screening
of the surface at least twice to obtain a uniform surface and then brooming to
produce a nonskid surface. The edges of all walks shall be rounded to a one-
quarter inch radius with an edging tool at least two inches wide. Transverse
joints shall be cut with a jointing tool at least three inches wide and a
projecting cutting edge at least one and one-half inches in depth. Transverse

joints on adjacent properties. The coloring of sidewalks by a permanent paint
or coloring powder is prohibited.
   (d)   Curing. Immediately after the final finishing and after any free water
has disappeared from the surface, all exposed surfaces shall be uniformly
sprayed with an approved curing compound or shall be cured by placing wet straw
or burlap on the surface. Burlap or straw shall be kept wet for seven days. No
concrete shall be laid when the temperature is below thirty-two degrees
Fahrenheit without permission of the Village Engineer, and then only pursuant
to provisions that he prescribes.
   (e)   Location. The street edge of the sidewalk shall be located not closer
than five feet from the back edge of the curb. Valve boxes that fall within the
sidewalk area shall be brought flush with the finished walk surface and
protected while construction is in progress. Roof drains shall be extended
under the sidewalk and through the curb.
   (f)   Regulations on File. Copies of these rules and regulations shall be on
file in the office of the Fiscal Officer.

the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
   (i)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges. If any waters or
wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers,
which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
subsection (f) and (g) hereof, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent
may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes,
equipment or receiving waters, including violation of applicable water quality
standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Superintendent shall:
      (1)   Reject the wastes.
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or,
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes under the Extra Strength Surcharge provisions of the Municipal Sewer
Service Rate Ordinance.
         A.   All industrial wastewaters discharged to the public sewers by
major contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 128, unless the Municipality is committed, in its NPDES Permit, to remove
a specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances the
applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Board of Public Affairs or their authorized representative,
or State regulatory agencies.
         B.   If the Superintendent requires pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Board of Public Affairs and State
regulatory agencies and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances, and laws. No permit will be granted until such pretreatment
facilities have been placed in operation and have demonstrated their
effectiveness by test. The cost of such testing, sampling, and analyzing shall
be borne by the wastewater contributor.
         C.   The approval of proposed pretreatment facilities by the Board of
Public Affairs does not guarantee that these facilities or equipment will
function in the manner described by their manufacturer; nor shall it relieve a
person, firm or corporation of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise
modifying such facilities to accomplish the intended purpose.
   (j)   Grease and Oil Interceptors. For grease, oil, and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
subsection (h) hereof, or any flammable wastes, sand, and other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal
by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the
dates, and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's
personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (k)   Operation of Pretreatment Facilities. Where pretreatment or flow-
equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the
Superintendent. The owner shall maintain operating records, and shall submit to
the Superintendent a quarterly summary report of the character of the influent
and effluent to show the performance of the treatment facilities.
   (l)   Analyses. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods" or "EPA
Methods". Reference is made to EPA "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for
Analysis of Pollutants" (40 CFR 136). Sampling methods, locations, times,
durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject
to approval by the Superintendent.
   (m)   Special Conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Municipality and any industrial concern whereby an industrial wastewater of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Municipality for
treatment, subject to possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for
subsequent treatment. Any industrial concern may appeal any determination made
by the Superintendent in the enforcement of this chapter. Any contract with an
industry shall be governed by all sewer service charges and regulations as
established in the Municipal Ordinances.
(Ord. 86-003. Passed 10-1-86.)
921.07 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS.
   (a)   Submission of Basic Data. Within sixty days after passage of this
chapter, each person whose operation entails the discharge of industrial
wastewater to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the Municipality a
written statement setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or
presently carried on, the proposed point of discharge of such wastewater into
the wastewater collection system of the Municipality, the estimated amount to
be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial,
physical, chemical and other known characteristics of such wastewater.
   Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty
of the Municipality to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in
the judgment of the Utilities Coordinator or his/her designee may be necessary
to adequately guard against unlawful uses of the municipal wastewater system.
If such a statement has been previously filed with the Municipality to the
satisfaction of the Utilities Coordinator or his/her designee, the requirements
of this section will be waived. (Ord. 2007-10. Passed 5-2-07.)
   (b)   Extension of Time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances
exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with
the time schedule imposed by subsection (a) hereof, a request for extension of
time may be presented for consideration of the Board of Public Affairs. All
requests for extension of time shall be submitted in writing stating the
reasons for such a request. Under no circumstances shall the extension of time
exceed thirty days after approval of the extension by the Board.
   (c)   Control Manholes. Each person discharging industrial wastewater into a
public sewer shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or
access points to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his
wastewater, including sanitary wastewater.
      (1)   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in
a manner acceptable to the Superintendent. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Superintendent.
      (2)   Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be
installed by the person discharging the wastewater at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper
operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities
shall be approved by the Superintendent prior to the beginning of construction.
      (3)   In the event no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstrem manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the Building Sewer is connected.
   (d)   Wastewater Volume Determination. The volume of flow used for computing
industrial wastewater charges shall be the metered water consumption of the
industrial user as shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by
the Municipality, except as herein provided in the following subsections:
      (1)   If the person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
Municipal water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
sewers, the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a
type approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume
of water obtained from those other sources.
      (2)   The person discharging industrial wastewater into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the
volume of wastewater being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial wastewater charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be
of a type acceptable to the Superintendent.
      (3)   The Superintendent may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of wastewater discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (4)   Any metering device for determining the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the
industrial user. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be
removed without the consent of the Superintendent.
   (e)   Sampling and Monitoring. Industrial wastewaters discharged into the
public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Superintendent. The owner shall be
responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
      (1)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastewater. One twenty-four hour composite sample
will be required, as a minimum. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use
of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples, or by
other approved means.
      (2)   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Superintendent
or his authorized representative at all times. Care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (f)   Analyses. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be those set forth in the latest edition of "Standard
Methods" or "EPA Methods". However, alternative methods for certain analyses of
industrial wastewaters may be used subject to mutual agreement between the
Superintendent and the industrial user. Reference is made to EPA "Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants" (40 CFR 136).
      (1)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastewaters shall be made by the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
or the industrial user's qualified agent as approved by the Superintendent. The
results of the analyses shall be reported to the Municipality on forms provided
by the Municipality. The Municipality may make its own analyses on the
wastewaters and these determinations, when made shall be binding as a basis for
charges, except under the circumstances in the following subsections.
      (2)   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Municipality
result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the
industry to collect samples at the same time the Municipality collects its own
samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected by the
Municipality and the industry shall be compared using the same testing
procedures as outlined in the latest edition of the Standard Methods and the
differences negotiated.

925.03 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The service charges shall consist of a user charge, extra strength
user surcharges, where applicable, and connection charge. The user charge is
payment to the Municipality by all recipients of sewer service for treatment of
“normal strength” wastewater or wastewater of less than “normal strength”.
   It is designed to offset the cost of operation and maintenance to the
collection and treatment facilities, including cost associated with equipment
replacement. The user charge is intended to enable the Sewer Department to be
financially self-sufficient with respect to operation and maintenance of its
facilities.
   (b)   For wastewaters which exceed “normal strength”, the user shall pay
extra strength user surcharges, as specified herein under Section
925.06 in addition to the other sewer service charges specified in this chapter
for “normal strength” wastewater.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 12-3-08.)
925.04 CLASSES OF USERS.

925.02.
(Ord. 86-004. Passed 4-30-86.)
925.05 USER CHARGES AND DEBT SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The following User Charges shall be paid by all classes of users
(defined in Section
925.04) throughout the service area effective January 1, 2019, and the charges
shall be based on each 1,000 gallons of flow being discharged into the sanitary
sewer system:
 
User Class  Dollars Per 1,000 Gallons
All Classes $8.74
 
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Effective January 1, 2019 and January 1st of each subsequent
calendar year for a period of five years ending on January 1, 2024, the sewer
user charges to all classes of sewer users shall be increased by 3.5% per 1,000
gallons of flow being discharged into the sanitary sewer system. The resulting
charges, commencing January 1, 2019, and for subsequent years, are as follows:
 
Effective Date  Effective Rate
January 1, 2019 $ 8.74
January 1, 2020 9.05
January 1, 2021 9.37
January 1, 2022 9.70
January 1, 2023 10.04

(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 12-3-08; Ord. 2018-26. Passed 12-5-18.)
   (b)   A minimum charge of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per month per
user is hereby established in order to generate sufficient revenue to recover
fixed costs associated with the wastewater treatment works.
   (c)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system will complete
and file with the Municipality an Industrial Waste Questionnaire containing
pertinent information as to quantity of flow, characteristics of discharged
wastewaters, etc., and this information will be used to determine billings for
the first year following the effective date of this chapter. Subsequent
billings will be based on revised information taken from annual updated reports
to be filed with the Sewer Department, or from other records. Interim reports
may be requested at the discretion of the Superintendent. New industries shall
file a fully executed Questionnaire with the Municipality prior to being issued
a Sewer Permit.
   (d)   Where industrial wastewater is combined with sanitary wastewater at
the point or points of discharge, and no separate metering of each increment is
provided, the sanitary wastewater from industry shall be considered equal to
fifteen gallons per day per employee (thirty gallons per day where showers are
used) at "Normal Strength" loadings as previously defined herein.
   (e)   The Service charges other than Minimum Charges shall be computed on
the basis of the water purchased from the Village of Sunbury water supplier
unless the actual quantity of wastewater entering the sanitary sewer system can
be determined, as specified hereinafter.
   (f)   Each premises served by the sanitary sewer system of the Municipality
shall be charged, and where a premises is served by more than one sewer
connection a combined charge shall be levied based on the total flow from all
connections. However, where the property is not occupied, a minimum charge
shall be levied for each sewer connection.
   (g)   Where more than one meter is installed, whether for the convenience of
the owner of the premises or the Municipality, Service Charges shall be
rendered to the owner of the premises for each meter, unless the combined flow
through all meters is authorized by the Superintendent.
   (h)   When a person, firm or corporation can show to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter(s)
does not enter the sanitary sewer system, such as uncontaminated cooling water,
such person, firm or corporation may submit an application in writing to the
Board of Public Affairs for the installation of an auxiliary water meter. The
Board has the authority to permit or to require an additional meter(s) to be
installed at the applicant's expense, so as to measure the quantity of water
actually entering the sanitary sewer system. The quantity of water used to
determine the Service Charges shall be the quantity of water entering the
sanitary sewer system as so determined.
   (i)   If the Superintendent finds that it is not practicable to measure such
water by meters, he shall determine the volume of wastewater in any manner or
method as he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of
metered water entering the sanitary sewer system and the quantity of water used
to determine the Sewer Service Charges shall be that percentage so determined.
   (j)   In the event that the conditions set forth in subsection (h) are not,
for any reason, met, all water metered to the premises shall be used for
billing purposes.
   (k)   When premises are supplied either whole or in part with water from
wells or any source other than a public water supply, such wells or source of
supply shall be registered in writing with the Administrator. The owner of the
premises shall install and maintain at his expense, a meter or meters
acceptable to the Department, on all such supplies, and the quantity of water
used to determine the service charges shall be the quantity as measured by the
meter or meters. If the meter or meters are not installed within six months
from the date of notification in writing by the Administrator, the owner or
other users of the premises shall be billed double the Minimum Charge.

standards, rules and regulations may be modified or waived by the
Administrator.
   (n)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all Service
Charges except for water used for purposes other than fire protection.
   (o)   Where a sanitary sewer in the area served by the Municipality is
available to any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises which is improved,
it is a conclusive presumption that wastewater from such lot, parcel of land,
building, or premises which is improved is discharged into such sewer, and the
owner shall be billed the Service Charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel
of land, building, or premises abutting a street, alley, or easement in which
there is a public sanitary sewer shall be deemed to have available access to a
sanitary sewer, and the owner or other users of such real property shall
connect to the sewer within six months from the date the owner is notified in
writing by the Administrator that the sewer is made available for use of their
property. In the event the owner or other users of the real property are not
connected on such date, the Minimum Charge specified under subsection (b)
hereof shall be imposed upon such property. Exceptions shall be as specified
under Section
921.03(d).

      (1)   The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system within the Department’s
jurisdiction to each user class in proportion to such user’s contribution to
the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength,
volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included
as the basis for the user’s contribution to insure a proportional distribution
of operation and maintenance (including replacement) costs to each user class.
      (2)   The system shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically to
reflect actual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the wastewater
system.

   (d)   In connection with the administering of this chapter, reference is
made to Chapter
921.07, specifically those sections pertaining to Control Manholes, Wastewater
Volume Determination, Sampling and Monitoring, and Analyses.
   (e)   The results of routine sampling and analysis by the Owner will be used
to determine the Extra Strength User Surcharges; however, the Administrator
may, at any period of time and of such duration and in such manner as the
Administrator may elect, determine the strength of the discharged wastewater
for purposes of verification. If the Owner fails to file the necessary annual
reports, the strength determined by the Sewer Department's analysis will be
used to determine the amount of Surcharges.
   (f)   If necessary, the Sewer Department shall have the right to enter and
set up, on Company property, such devices as are necessary to conduct a gauging
and sampling operation and to begin such operation without advance notice to
the Company or Owner. While performing the work, the Department's personnel
will observe all Safety Rules applicable to the premises, established by the
Company.
   (g)   Where a Company has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto such Company's premises is
granted such Company shall either make necessary arrangements with their
security guards that upon showing proper identification, personnel from the
Department will be permitted to enter, without delays, for the purpose of
obtaining samples (grab or composite) of wastewaters being discharged at the
various sampling points; or the Company shall install suitable gauging and
sampling manholes outside the security limits, such manholes will at all times
be immediately accessible to Department personnel.

963.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Term. This chapter and the procedures established herein shall remain
in effect unless and until repealed, amended, or modified by the City Council
in accordance with applicable State law and the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Affected Area. Development impact fees are to be imposed only on new
development proposed within the corporate boundaries of the City, by
development fee service area.
   (c)   Type of Development Affected. Except as provided in subsection (d)
below, this chapter applies to all new development.
   (d)   Type of Development Not Affected; Exemptions. This chapter does not
apply to:
      (1)    Previously-Issued Building Permits. The previously applicable
development impact fee will be imposed on new development for which a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, or an
amendment thereto, except that if such building permit expires, the development
will be treated as new development and be subject to the provisions of this
chapter. The impact fees in effect at the time the permit is applied for will
apply to new development.
      (2)   No Net Increase in Nonresidential Floor Area. No development impact
fee may be imposed on any new nonresidential development that does not result
in the creation of new floor area, unless the Zoning Inspector makes a written
determination that the new development increases the demand for public
facilities for which development impact fees are being imposed.
      (3)   Replacements. No development impact fee may be imposed on the
replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or structure
provided that there is no change in use and no net increase in the number of
dwelling units or amount of nonresidential floor area.
      (4)   Temporary Uses. No development impact fee may be imposed on a
temporary use, including construction trailers and offices, but only for the
life of the building permit issued for the construction served by the trailer
or office.
      (5)   Development Agreements. No development impact fee may be imposed on
new development that is the subject of a duly executed and lawful development
agreement entered into by an applicant and the City prior to the effective date
of this chapter, or an amendment thereto, which agreement contains provisions
in conflict or inconsistent with this chapter, but only to the extent of the
conflict or inconsistency.
      (6)   Governmental Uses Exempt. No development impact fee may be imposed
on development proposed by a local, regional, state, or federal governmental
agency if the imposition of the fee is prohibited by law. Prior to the issuance
of a building permit, the governmental agency seeking an exemption pursuant to
this subparagraph must apply to the City Council for approval. If the City
Council grants the exemption, the City Council must deposit funds from a
revenue source other than impact fees into the designated impact fee account
equal in amount to the impact fees otherwise owed by the governmental agency.
      (7)   Other Uses. No development impact fee may be imposed on a use,
development, project, structure, building, fence, sign or other activity,
whether or not a building permit is required, which does not result in an
increase in the demand for public facilities.
   (e)   Effect of Payment of Development Impact Fees on Other Applicable City
Land Use, Zoning, Platting, Subdivision, or Development Regulations.
      (1)   The payment of development impact fees shall not entitle the
applicant to a building permit unless all applicable land use, zoning,
planning, dedication, platting, subdivision, or other related requirements,
standards, and conditions of the Codified Ordinances have been met. Such other
requirements, standards, and conditions are independent of the requirement for
payment of a development impact fee.
      (2)   This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use
of property, density/intensity of development, design and improvement
standards, or other applicable standards or requirements of the Codified
Ordinances, which shall remain operative and in full force and effect without
limitation.
   (f)   Amendments. This chapter, and any ordinance adopting development
impact fees for any particular public facility pursuant to this chapter, may be
amended from time to time by the City Council; provided, however, that no such
amendment shall be adopted without a written report detailing the reasons and
need for the development impact fee revision nor without proper notice and
public hearing as required by state law and the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2003-62. Passed 11-5-03; Ord. 2022-36. Passed 9-7-22.)
963.04 PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION, REIMBURSEMENT, CREDIT, AND
COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
   (a)   In General. The City Inspector must notify the applicant of the
applicable development impact fee requirements, including applicable service
charges, at the time of application for a building permit on a form provided by
the City for such purposes. The Zoning Inspector must calculate the applicable
development impact fee at the time of application for a building permit. The
City may not issue a building permit until the applicant has paid all
development impact fees due pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the Zoning
Inspector must determine:
         A.   Whether the proposed new development constitutes a residential or
nonresidential use;
         B.   The specific category of residential or non-residential
development, and
         C.   The amount of additional square feet of nonresidential gross
floor area or the number of additional dwelling units associated with the
proposed use.
      (2)   If the application for a building permit involves a change in use,
the development impact fee due must be based on the incremental increase in the
fee for the increase in the public facility capacity created by the proposed
change in use.
      (3)   After making these determinations, the Zoning Inspector must
calculate the applicable development impact fee by multiplying the number of
dwelling units or amount of nonresidential floor area proposed by the amount of
the applicable development impact fee per unit of development, incorporating
any applicable exemptions or credits.
      (4)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the particular development impact fee ordinance and
schedule, the Zoning Inspector, in consultation with other City staff and
consultants, as necessary, must:
         A.   Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the
development impact fee based on the development impact fee for the land use
identified;
         B.   Identify the broader land use category within which the specified
land use would apply and calculate the development impact fee based on the
development impact fee for that land use category; or
         C.   As appropriate, determine the basis used to calculate the fee
pursuant to an independent impact analysis pursuant to subsection (c) below.
         The Zoning Inspector's determination must be based on a generally-
accepted land use classification system (e.g., the Institute of Traffic
Engineers' Trip Generation Manual, the North American Industry Classification
System, the Land Based Classification Standards) and the methodology report.
      (5)   The calculation of development impact fees due from a multiple-use
new development must reflect the aggregated demand for each public facility
generated by each land use type within the proposed new development.
      (6)   The calculation of development impact fees due from a phased new
development must reflect the demand generated by each specific land use within
the phase of development for which a separate building permit is requested.
      (7)   Development impact fees must be calculated based on the development
impact fee amount in effect at the time of application for a building permit.
   (c)   Independent Impact Analysis. The following provisions shall apply to
any independent impact analysis:
      (1)   The applicant is responsible, at its sole expense, for preparing
the independent impact analysis, which must be reviewed for approval by the
Zoning Inspector, and, as appropriate, other City staff or officials, prior to
payment of the fee.
      (2)   The independent impact analysis must measure the impact that the
proposed new development will have on the particular public facility at issue,
must be based on the same methodologies used in the methodology report, and
must be supported by professionally acceptable data and assumptions.
      (3)   Within thirty days of submittal of the independent impact analysis,
the Zoning Inspector must provide written notice to the applicant as to whether
the analysis is accepted or rejected based on the provisions of this section.
If the independent impact analysis is rejected, the written notice must provide
an explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.
      (4)   The final decision of the Zoning Inspector may be appealed pursuant
to Section 963.06 of this chapter.
   (d)   Non-binding Development Impact Fee Estimate. An applicant may request
a nonbinding estimate of development impact fees due for a particular new
development at any time by filing a request on a form provided for such purpose
by the City; provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change
when a formal application for a building permit for new development is made.
Such nonbinding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant
and in no way binds the City or precludes it from making amendments or
revisions to any provisions of this chapter or the specific development impact
fee implementing ordinances. No vested rights, legal entitlements, or equitable
estoppel accrue by reason of a non-binding estimate. A non-binding fee estimate
does not constitute a final decision and may not be appealed pursuant to
Section 963.06.
   (e)   Reimbursements and Credits.
      (1)   Eligibility for a Reimbursement. The City Council may enter into a
development agreement with an applicant, which provides for the reimbursement
of impact fees in exchange for the dedication or construction
         of public facilities made necessary by a proposed new development. The
City may reimburse impact fees already paid only for the type of facility
dedicated or constructed by the applicant. Reimbursements must be made from the
impact fee account earmarked for the same type of public facility being
dedicated or constructed. No impact fees may be reimbursed for a proffered
public facility unless:
         A.   It is included in the City's capital budget, capital improvement
plan, or the methodology report; or
         B.   It adds public facility capacity made necessary by and to be
provided for the proportionate benefit of new development.
      (2)   Additional Provisions.
         A.   In order to be eligible for a reimbursement, the applicant must
receive approval by the City Council pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
         B.   Except as provided below, the City may not reimburse the
applicant in an amount exceeding the amount of the development impact fee due
pursuant to this chapter.
         C.   The City may not reimburse the applicant until a proffered land
dedication is finalized or the construction project is at least fifty percent
(50%) complete. Reimbursement may then occur based on the percent completion of
the project.
         D.   If an applicant proposes to dedicate or construct public
facilities valued at an amount greater than the amount of the impact fee due,
then the development agreement may provide for reimbursements to the applicant
by future developers of costs incurred over and above those reimbursed by the
City.
      (3)   Procedures for Reimbursements.
         A.   Application made to the Zoning Inspector. Applications for a
reimbursement must be made on a form provided by the City Inspector for such
purposes. The application must be accompanied by a proposed development
agreement developed through coordination with City staff. Upon receipt of a
complete application and proposed development agreement, the Zoning Inspector,
City Attorney, and other appropriate staff and/or consultants must review the
application and proposed agreement, as well as such other information and
evidence as may be deemed relevant, and the Zoning Inspector must forward a
report as to whether a reimbursement is proper based on the provisions of this
chapter to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         B.    Recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Based on
the report of the Zoning Inspector, the provisions of this chapter, the capital
improvement plan, comprehensive plan, adopted City Budget, and the methodology
report, the Planning and Zoning Commission must recommend to the City Council
to accept, reject, or accept with conditions the proposed reimbursement and
development agreement.
         C.   City Council. Based on the report of the Zoning Inspector, the
provisions of this chapter, the capital improvement plan, comprehensive plan,
adopted City budget, the methodology report, and the recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council must make a final decision to
accept, reject, or accept
            with conditions the proposed reimbursement and development
agreement.
         D.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the City Council may
be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County.
      (4)   Calculation of the Value of Dedication or Construction. The amount
of the reimbursement to be paid by the City is to be calculated as follows:
         A.    Construction of Facilities and Provision of Equipment. The
reimbursement must be equal to the actual cost of construction or equipment as
evidenced by receipts and other sufficient documentation or the amount of
development impact fees due pursuant to this chapter, whichever is less.
         B.   Dedication of Land. At the option of the applicant, the
reimbursement is to be based on either the assessed value of the proffered
land, based on the most recent County property appraisal, or the fair market
value of the land as determined by a certified property appraiser hired and
paid for by the applicant, If the latter option is chosen and the City rejects
the applicant's appraisal, the City may hire and pay for a second appraiser to
appraise the property, If either party rejects the second appraisal, a third
appraisal may be performed by an appraiser chosen by the first and second
appraisers, the costs of which are to be shared equally by the City and the
applicant. The third appraisal is binding on both parties. All appraisals must
be consistent with generally-accepted appraisal techniques and the date of
valuation must be the date of transfer to the City.
      (5)   Development Agreement Requirements. No reimbursement may be made
except pursuant to an executed development agreement between the City and the

following:
         A.   The estimated cost of the public facility to be constructed or

         B.   A schedule for the initiation and completion of the construction
of a public facility;

      (7)   Eligibility for Credits for Excessive Dedication or Construction.
An applicant may be given a credit against a development impact fee upon

dedicated or constructed by a previous applicant with sufficient excess
capacity to offset the impacts of the applicant's proposed new development. In
order for a credit to be accepted, the applicant must demonstrate that the
dedicated or constructed public facility will reduce the overall need for
public facilities and that the applicant has secured a contractual right to an
allocation of capacity equal to the impact fee owned by the applicant. Any
approved credit must be consistent with the City's capital budget, capital
improvement plan, comprehensive plan, and the methodology report.
      (8)   Procedures for Credits.
         A.   Application made to the Zoning Inspector. Applications for a
credit must be made on a form provided by the City Inspector for such purposes.
The application must be accompanied by a development agreement executed after
the effective date of this chapter, or an amendment thereto, which
demonstrates, among other things, that excess public facility capacity has been
provided by a previous applicant, which will provide a proportionate benefit to
the new development proposed by the applicant. Upon receipt of a complete
application, the Zoning Inspector, and other appropriate staff and/or
consultants must review the application, as well as such other information and
evidence as may be deemed relevant. The Zoning Inspector must determine whether
a credit is proper based on the provisions of this chapter, the capital
improvement plan, the comprehensive plan, the methodology report, and/or other
relevant evidence.
         B.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the Zoning Inspector
may be made to the City Council pursuant to Section
963.06.
   (f)   Collection. The City Inspector must collect all development impact
fees and service charges in the amounts set forth in this chapter at the time
of issuance of a building permit and must issue a receipt to the applicant for
such payment unless:
      (1)   The applicant is not subject to the payment of a development impact
fee; or
      (2)   The applicant has filed an appeal as required by Section
963.06 and has filed a bond or other surety in the amount of the development
impact fee as calculated by the City Inspector and approved by the City
Attorney and City Fiscal Officer.

963.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE ACCOUNTS; USE AND APPROPRIATION
OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE FUNDS; AND REFUNDS.
   (a)   Development Impact Fee Accounts. The City Fiscal Officer must
establish a development impact fee account for each category of public facility
for which development impact fees are imposed, by development impact fee
service area. Such account must identify clearly the public facility for which
the development impact fee has been imposed. All development impact fees
collected by the City must be deposited into the appropriate development impact
fee account by impact fee service area. All interest earned on monies deposited
into a particular impact fee account must be credited to and considered funds
of that account. The funds of each such account must be capable of being
accounted for separately from all other City funds in order to ensure future
fee expenditures provide a specific and proportionate benefit to the property.
The City Fiscal Officer must establish and implement necessary accounting
controls to ensure that the development impact fee funds are properly
deposited, accounted for, and appropriated in accordance with this chapter and
other applicable legal requirements.
   (b)   Use of Development Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)   Generally. All appropriations from development impact fee accounts
must be approved by the City Council and detailed on a form provided for such
purposes and filed with the City Fiscal Officer. Development impact fee funds
may be used only for:
         A.   Public facility expenditures within the development impact fee
service area from which they were collected;
         B.   The payment of principal, interest, and other financing costs on
contracts, bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the
City to finance public facilities;
         C.   Financing of refunds as set forth in Section 963.05(d);
         D.   Financing of reimbursements as set forth in Section 963.04(e); or
         E.   Financing the costs of updating this chapter.
         Consistent with Section 963.05(c), prior to appropriating development
impact fee funds, the City Fiscal Officer must generate a written report which
demonstrates that such funds are being used to finance public facility capacity
that provides or will provide benefits to new development that are
proportionate to the impact of that development. The report must be consistent
with the methodology report. The written report must be presented to and
accepted by the City Council.
      (2)   Restrictions on Use. Development impact fees may not be
appropriated for repair or maintenance of public facilities, or for operational
or personnel expenses associated with the provision of public facilities.
Additionally, development impact fees must be appropriated:
         A.   For the particular public facility for which they were imposed,
calculated, and collected;
         B.   Within the development impact fee service area from which they
were collected; and
         C.   Within six years of the beginning of the City's fiscal year
immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period is
extended as provided in subsection (b)(3) hereof.
      (3)   Appropriation of Development Impact Fee Funds Beyond Six (6) Years
of Collection. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b)(2) above,
development impact fee funds may be appropriated beyond six years from the
beginning of the City's fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of
collection, if the appropriation is for a public facility that requires more
than six years to plan, design, and construct. The City must document
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
   (c)   Procedure for Appropriation of Development Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)   Each year the City Council must identify public facility capacity
anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with development impact fees.
Public facility expenditures must be consistent with the methodology report,
the capital improvement plan, the comprehensive plan, and the annual review
described in Section
 963.07, and such other information as may be relevant to ensure compliance
with this chapter.
      (2)   The City Council may include public facilities funded with
development impact fees in the City's annual budget or capital improvements
plan. If included, the description of the public facility must specify the
nature of the public facility, the location of the public facility, the
capacity to be added and/or funded by the appropriation, the service area of
the public facility, the need/demand for the public facility, and the
anticipated timing of completion of the public facility.
      (3)   Consistent with the provisions of this chapter, the City Council
may authorize public facilities expenditures at such other times as it deems
necessary.
      (4)   The City Council must verify that adequate development impact fee
funds are or will be available from the appropriate development impact fee
account for the particular public facility capacity to be funded with
development impact fees.
      (5)   Development impact fee funds must be spent on a first in/first out
basis.
   (d)   Refunds.
      (1)   Eligibility.
         A.   Expiration or Revocation of Building Permit. An applicant who has
paid an impact fee for a new development for which construction has not begun,
and the necessary building permit has expired or has been revoked, may apply
for a refund of impact fees paid. Refunds must be to the initial applicant who
paid the development impact fee. The refund application should be made on a
form provided by the City for such purposes.
         B.   Failure of City to Appropriate Development Impact Fee Funds
Within Time Limit. A current property owner may apply for a refund of
development impact fees paid by an applicant if the City has failed to
appropriate the development impact fees collected from the applicant within the
time limit established in subsection (b)(2) above. Refunds made pursuant to
this subparagraph must be to current property owner. The refund application
must be made on a form provided by the City for such purposes.
         C.   Abandonment of New Development. An applicant who has paid an
impact fee for a new development for which a building permit has been issued
and pursuant to which construction has been initiated but abandoned prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, is eligible for a refund if the
uncompleted building is completely demolished.
      (2)   Administrative Fee. The City may deduct a two hundred dollar
($200.00) administrative fee from the amount of any refund granted and retain
the administrative fee in the appropriate development impact fee account to
defray the administrative expenses associated with processing a refund
application.
      (3)   Processing of Applications for a Refund.
         A.   Application made to the Zoning Inspector. Applications for a
refund must be made on a form provided by the City Inspector for such purposes.
Upon receipt of a complete application for a refund, the Zoning Inspector must
review the application and documentary evidence submitted by the applicant, as
well as such other information and evidence as may be deemed relevant and must
forward a report as to whether a refund is due based on the provisions of this
chapter to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         B.    Recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Based on
the report of the Zoning Inspector, the provisions of this chapter, and the
methodology report, the Planning and Zoning Commission must recommend to the
City Council to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the proposed refund.
         C.   City Council. Based on the report of the Zoning Inspector, the
provisions of this chapter, the methodology report, and the recommendation of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council must make a final decision to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed refund and
appropriation.
         D.   Appeals. Appeals from the final decision of the City Council may
be made to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County.
      (4)   Due to Expiration or Revocation. Applications for refunds due to
expiration or revocation of a building permit must be made on forms provided by
the City for such purposes and made within sixty days following expiration or
revocation of the building permit. In order for the refund application to be
deemed complete, the applicant must submit:
         A.   Evidence that the person applying for the refund was the initial
applicant who paid the fee, or the authorized agent of the initial applicant;
         B.   The amount of the development impact fees paid by public facility
category and receipts evidencing such payments; and
         C.    Documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the
building permit. Failure to apply for a refund within sixty days following
expiration or revocation of the building permit constitutes a waiver of
entitlement to a refund. No interest must be paid by the City in calculating
the amount of a refund pursuant to this paragraph.
      (5)   Due to Timeliness. Applications for refunds due to the failure of
the City to appropriate development impact fees collected from the applicant
within the time limits established in subsection (b)(2) above must be made on
forms provided by the Zoning Inspector and must be made within one year
following the expiration of such time limit. In order for the refund
application to be deemed complete, the applicant must submit:

authorized agent of the current property owner;
         B.   The amount of the development impact fees paid by public facility
category and receipts evidencing such payments; and

Interest must be paid by the City in calculating the amount of the refunds
pursuant to this section.

a new development prior to completion must be on a form provided by the City
Inspector for such purposes. The application must include:

category and receipts evidencing such payments; and
         C.    Documentation evidencing the demolition of the building
partially constructed pursuant to payment of the impact fees to be refunded.
            Failure to apply for a refund within sixty days following
expiration or revocation of the building permit or demolition of the structure
constitutes a waiver of entitlement to a refund. No interest must be paid by
the City in calculating the amount of the refund pursuant to this paragraph.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1309.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
The Village of Sunbury, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows,
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Sunbury has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Sunbury as identified in Section
1309.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   The Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Delaware County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated April 16, 2009, and the Flood Insurance Study for
Delaware County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas dated February 17, 2016.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard, include:
      (1)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1309.29 Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps

1309.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)

areas.
   (13)   "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)." An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   "Flood insurance risk zones." Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      A.   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood

levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (15)   "Flood insurance study (FIS)." The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   "Floodproofing." Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (17)   "Flood protection elevation (FPE)." The base flood elevation plus one
foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (18)   "Floodway."
      A.   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      B.   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (19)   "Freeboard." A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (20)   "Historic structure." Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (21)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis." An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (22)   "Letter of map change (LOMC)." An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      A.   "Letter of map amendment (LOMA)." A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   "Letter of map revision (LOMR)." A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   "Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)." A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   (23)   "Lowest floor." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (24)   "Manufactured home." A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 4781.
   (25)   "Mean sea level." For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   (26)   "Manufactured home park." As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-
01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home park does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.
   (27)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)." The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (28)   "New construction."
      A.   Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or
after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the Village and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      B.   For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of
an initial FIRM September 1, 1987 or after December 31,1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (29)   "Person." Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15
(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (30)   "Recreational vehicle." A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (31)   "Registered professional architect." A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture pursuant to R.C. §§ 4703.01 and 4703.19.
   (32)   "Registered professional engineer." A person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (33)   "Registered professional surveyor." A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (34)   "Special flood hazard area." Also known as "areas of special flood
hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (35)   "Start of construction." The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (36)   "Structure." A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (37)   "Substantial damage." Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (38)   "Substantial improvement." Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (39)   "Variance." A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations.
   (40)   "Violation." The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the Village and may be
submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village’s Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

1309.23 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1309.36 through
1309.41.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
(Ord. 2021-26. Passed 7-7-21.)
1309.24 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (a)   Zone A:
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably be utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1309.35(b) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C, and X: Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary
FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the
effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO.
Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data
to ensure that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are
protected.

1309.25 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

1309.35 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1309.22(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village and the chief executive
officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Division (a)(2)A. and C. through E. of this section.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section 1309.22(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

1309.39 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of Sunbury.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing.
      (1)   Notices of public hearing will be in accordance with the Zoning
Code of Sunbury.
      (2)   Adjoining property owner notices of public hearing are not
required.
   (c)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Board of Zoning Appeals requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (c)(1)A. to K. of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
