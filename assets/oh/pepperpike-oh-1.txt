EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self- identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

known as the Village of Pepper Pike shall continue to be a body politic and
corporate under the name of Pepper Pike, with the same boundaries as now exist,
but with power and authority to change its boundaries in the manner authorized
by the laws of Ohio, except that no territory shall be detached from or annexed
to the Municipality, nor shall the Municipality be annexed to, or merged with,
any other body politic, nor shall the corporate existence of the Municipality
be terminated, without the consent of the Council of the Municipality and of a
majority of its electors voting on such question at a general election.
ARTICLE II
POWERS
   Pepper Pike shall have all the powers, general or special, governmental or
proprietary, which may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed or exercised by
municipalities under the laws of Ohio. All such powers may be exercised in the
manner prescribed in this Charter, or, if not prescribed herein, in such manner
as the Council may determine, or, unless a contrary intent appears in this
Charter or in the enactments of the Council, in such manner as may now or
hereafter be provided by the laws of Ohio.

be elected at the regular municipal election in 1969 and every fourth year
thereafter.
Section III-2. ORGANIZATION.
   In January, 1967, and in January of each year thereafter, the Council shall
meet in the Council Chamber and organize. At such organization meeting, or as
soon as practicable thereafter, the Council shall elect one Councilman as the

adopted by election, and ordinances and other measures adopted by the Council
shall be subject to referendum, to the extent and in the manner now or
hereafter provided by the Constitution and the laws of Ohio.
   No ordinance or resolution which lessens the use, height, or area
restrictions to which a zoning district is subject under the Zoning Code of the
City of Pepper Pike (Codified Ordinances, Part Twelve) or which amends the Zone
Map of the City of Pepper Pike shall go into effect unless first submitted to a
vote of the electors upon referendum and approved by a majority of the electors
voting on such issue. (Amended November 6, 2012)
Section VIII-2. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the Municipality. If an elected officer shall have
served for six months of his or her term, a petition demanding his or her
removal may be filed with the Clerk of Council who shall note thereon the name
and address of the person filing the petition and the date of such filing. Such
petition may be circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be
bound together and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name
and office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more
than two hundred words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be
signed by at least that number of electors which equals twenty-five percent of
the electors voting at the last preceding general election. Within ten days
after the day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk shall
determine whether or not it meets the requirements hereof. If the Clerk shall
find the petition insufficient, he or she shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of his or her
certificate to the person who filed the petition with him or her, and make a
record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of twenty days
after the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient, he or she shall
promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to
the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery.
If such officer shall not resign within five days after the day on which such
delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon fix a day for
holding a recall election, not less than sixty nor more than seventy-five days
after the date of such delivery. At such recall election this question shall be
placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to continue as
(naming the office) ?" with provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or
negatively on such question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election
shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain in office. If a
majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer shall be
considered as removed, his or her office shall be deemed vacant, and such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed by
such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
created thereby.
   Not more than three persons holding an office to which they have been
elected pursuant to this Charter may be removed at any recall election.
Successive recall elections shall not be held more frequently than once every
ninety days.

   If the provisions of different codes, chapters or sections of the Codified
Ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the

passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
202.07 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)

failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
and any future legislation.

thousand dollars ($50,000), upon the prior approval of four members of Council,
which approval may be made in writing or by a motion and vote at any regular or
special meeting of Council. Authorization provided by Council in writing shall
only be effective if all members of Council are sent a written explanation of
the amount and purpose of the proposed expenditure, and the reason for the
necessity of action prior to the next meeting of Council. Further, all written
authorizations for such expenditures shall be announced at the next regular or
special meeting of Council by the Mayor, and such announcement shall include a
report of how the members of Council were notified in writing and the reason
why immediate action was necessary.
   (h)   Real Estate. The Mayor may purchase, sell or lease real property
valued below twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), provided that a current

next Council meeting (including any work session). The Council may, by
ordinance, provide for the purchase, sale or lease of real property, valued at

submission for awarding a contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during
this period. The City’s failure to award and execute the contract within this
period invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless
the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual consent
of the City and the bidder whose bid the City accepts and with respect to whom
the City subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension
shall not entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (l)   Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to Section 9.31
of the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the City’s right
to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (m)   Bids in Excess of Estimate. The City may award contracts regardless of
the amount of the bid as compared to the estimated cost.
   (n)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to
proceed with the work by the City or its representative upon execution of the
contract. The City shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time that it
determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract for its
convenience.
   (o)   Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the contractor
at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage shall not be
held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such times and in
such amounts as the City determines to be equitable.
   (p)   General Contractor Permitted. The City may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
   (q)   Extension of Bid Opening. The City may issue an addendum or addenda
modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for the bid
opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued within
forty-eight hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be extended by
at least three days.
   (r)   Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The City at its discretion
may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (s)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The City may offer a bonus for
completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.

234.01 APPORTIONMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE ASSISTANCE FUND.
   Council hereby approves the alternative formula for apportionment of the
Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund proposed by the Cuyahoga County Budget
Commission which consists of the following:
   (a)    A guaranteed "Base Allocation," which will be adjusted annually, and
the "excess" above base allocation. The excess allocation is determined by
employing four equally weighted statistical factors which are entirely
objective and subject to simple verification. The four statistical factors
employed in allocating the excess are:
      (1)    Population divided by assessed value per capita;
      (2)    Population divided by per capita income;
      (3)    Population multiplied by population density;
      (4)    Welfare recipients.
   (b)    Because the LGRAF has no history to predicate a base allocation, this
Fund will be distributed according to the above-mentioned excess formula until
a three-year history can be determined, at which point there will be a
guaranteed base allocation and an excess allocation.
      (Res. 1989-54. Passed 8-16-89.)
234.02 WITHDRAWAL OF PUBLIC FUNDS.
   (a)    Any active or inactive public funds deposited to the credit of the

the rules of the bank or trust company by the signatures of any two of the
following:
      (1)    Clerk of Council
      (2)    Treasurer
      (3)    Authorized Signer
who are hereby authorized to endorse and sign checks, drafts and orders for the
payment of money.
   (b)    Any safety deposit box of any bank or trust company in the name of
the Municipality may be entered in accordance with the rules of the bank or
trust company by any two of the following:
      (1)    Clerk of Council
      (2)    Treasurer
      (3)    Authorized Signer.
         (Ord. 1972-5. Passed 1-6-72.)

   The following regulations shall govern vacation leave for all employees of

   (a)   Vacation leave is leave with pay granted to employees as a reward for
satisfactory service and as an incentive for future service.
   (b)   Full-time employees are entitled to vacation leave with pay, full-time
being considered employees who are regularly scheduled to work forty or more
hours per week. Part-time employees working a regular established schedule of
less than forty hours per week shall accumulate vacation leave during the year
on the basis of one-fifth of a day for each forty hours of work. Seasonal
employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave. Part-time firefighters do
not work a regular established schedule and are not entitled to vacation leave.
   (c)   Employees shall earn vacation leave, to be taken during the calendar
year after it is earned, as follows:
      (1)   From the date of employment to December 31 of the calendar year in
which the employment commenced (“the Employment Year”) and to the end of the
fifth (5th) calendar year of continuous employment after the Employment Year,
one (1) day for each month worked up to a maximum of ten (10) days.
      (2)   From the end of the fifth (5th) calendar year to the end of the
twelfth (12th) calendar year of continuous employment after the Employment
Year, one and one-half (1 ½) days for each month worked up to a maximum of
fifteen (15) days.
      (3)   From the end of the twelfth (12th) calendar year to the end of the
eighteenth (18th) calendar year of continuous employment after the Employment
Year, one and two-thirds (1 2/3) days for each month worked up to a maximum of
twenty (20) days.
      (4)   From the end of the eighteenth (18th) calendar year of continuous
employment after the Employment Year, two and one-half (2 ½) days for each
month worked up to a maximum of twenty-five (25) days.
   (d)   Vacation leave cannot be accumulated and must be taken during the
calendar year after the year in which it was earned. The Mayor may give written
permission to carry over vacation leave because of scheduling or because work
by the City makes it impractical for the employee to use all of their vacation
time in that calendar year.
   (e)   Vacation pay shall be paid at the rate of pay in effect at the time
the leave is taken.
   (f)   An employee who is discharged shall forfeit all unused vacation leave
earned. An employee who dies, becomes permanently disabled or voluntarily
terminates employment after giving thirty (30) days’ written notice shall

provided in the current general classification and compensation ordinance. Such
compensation shall be in addition to the regular compensation provided in the
current general classification and compensation ordinance, and shall be payable
in a lump sum to each eligible employee on December 15 of each year, based upon
the following schedule:
 
Full Years         Average Salary Paid
of Service to December 1   Within Calendar Year (%)
   After 5 years         2
   After 10 years         3
   After 15 years         4
   After 20 years         6
 
   For full-time employees who are compensated on an hourly basis, the average
salary shall be the base pay computed on 2,080 hours per year, not including
overtime, except that the average salary of full-time employees who are
compensated on an hourly basis and who regularly work less than forty hours per
week shall be computed by multiplying their hourly rate times the hours
actually worked in their last full year of service to December 1. For salaried
employees, the average salary shall be the rate in effect on December 1 for
that month multiplied by twelve. Employees shall be considered full-time when
they regularly perform twenty-five hours or more service weekly.
   Longevity pay shall not be paid to elected officials or employees who render
part-time, seasonal or intermittent service.
   Time served by an employee during any probationary period shall be included
in computing longevity pay. Any interruption in the service of an employee,
except for allowed vacations, holidays, sick leave and authorized leaves of
absence, shall be deemed a termination of such employee’s tenure in office for
the purpose of determining his or her eligibility for longevity pay.
   If an employee retires, the employee shall be paid longevity compensation
for the year in which the employee retires in an amount prorated to the date of
retirement.

      (Ord. 2007-61. Passed 7-18-07.)
250.11 COMPENSATION OF POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES INJURED WHILE

(Ord. 2001-57. Passed 12-19-01.)
250.13 PICK-UP OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM
AND POLICE AND FIREMEN'S DISABILITY AND PENSION FUND.
   The City's method of payment of salary and the provision of fringe benefits
to all employees of the City who are members of the Public Employees Retirement
System (PERS) and the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund (PFDPF),
are hereby modified as set forth below, in order to provide for a salary
reduction pickup of employee contributions to the PERS and PFDPF, in accordance
with Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(hereinafter referred to as "the Code") and the rulings thereunder.
   (a)    The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each employee
shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contract of such
employee and applicable City policies. Such total annual salary and salary per
pay period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: deferred
salary and cash salary. An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that
percentage of said employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period
which is required, from time to time, by the PERS or PFDPF on behalf of said
employee as a pick-up and in lieu of the PERS or PFDPF employee contribution
otherwise payable by said employee. An employee's cash salary shall be equal to
said employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period less the amount of
the pick-up for said employee, and shall be payable, subject to all applicable
payroll deductions, to said employee. The City shall compute and remit its
employer contributions to the PERS or PFDPF based upon each employee's total
annual salary or salary per pay period, including the aforesaid pick-up. The
City's total combined expenditures for its employees' total salaries otherwise
payable under such employees' contracts and applicable City policies (including
pickup amounts), and its employer contributions to the PERS or PFDPF, shall not
be greater than the amounts the City would have paid for those items had this
provision not been in effect.
   (b)    The pick-up shall be included in each employee's total annual salary
for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence or for any similar purpose.
   (c)    The pick-up by the City of each employee's contribution to the PERS
or PFDPF shall be mandatory for each such employee. No such employee shall have
the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of
having them paid by the City to the PERS or PFDPF.
   (d)    The City specifically acknowledges that the contributions, although

similar.
(ORC 4510.05)
408.04 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,

      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:

officer’s law enforcement agency;

414.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected in place.
 
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
408.04 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
   Penalty - see Sections
408.01 and

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)    All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals are erected at all
intersections with such through highways, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and
no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation, that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes the stop sign under this subsection, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)    Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or highway, or
portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic control
signals at the entrances-of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be a Municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on such street or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the Municipality
may, by ordinance, designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to
be a through street or highway, and thereafter the affected residence district
shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or more
through highways designated under this subsection intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authority, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)    Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way or merge with all traffic proceeding
on the through street or highway.
   (d)    Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
414.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
     The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
414.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in

      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified

the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or

finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
 
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
 
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on

electronic wireless communications device.
 
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
 
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has safely and
appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any recommendations of
the physician, nurse, or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Police Chief. If the Police Chief
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after- hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left

When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated

structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

this section by a bicycle operator, electric bicycle operator, or motor vehicle
operator when the trier of fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle
operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of this
Traffic Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any

strict liability offenses and strict liability is a culpable mental state for
purposes of R.C. § 2901.20. The designation of these offenses as strict
liability offenses shall not be construed to imply that any other offense, for
which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict liability
offense.

606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
 
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
 
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
 
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization may be prosecuted for
an offense committed by such organization if he or she acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)

      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in

benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed

commission of a theft offense.

other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

the department, agency or institution with which the public official is

misdemeanor of the second degree.

606.21 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.

actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary

abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was

misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under

      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.21.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

all related provisions of law, a person arrested for a violation of this
division shall be considered to be under arrest for operating a vehicle while

charge of the violation of division (c) of this section, the offender also
shall be sentenced in accordance with R.C. § 4511.19, or a substantially

      (2)   “Organization.” Includes a national or international organization
with which a fraternity or sorority is affiliated.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall recklessly participate in the hazing of another.

alumnus, or volunteer of any organization, including any primary, secondary, or
post-secondary school or any other educational institution, public or private,
shall recklessly permit the hazing of any person associated with the
organization.
   (c)   (1)   No person shall recklessly participate in the hazing of another
when the hazing includes coerced consumption of alcohol or drugs of abuse
resulting in serious physical harm to the other person.
      (2)   No administrator, employee, faculty member, teacher, consultant,
alumnus, or volunteer of any organization, including any primary, secondary, or
post-secondary school or any other educational institution, public or private,
shall recklessly permit the hazing of any person associated with the
organization when the hazing includes coerced consumption of alcohol or drugs
of abuse resulting in serious physical harm to that person.
   (d)   Whoever violates divisions (b) or (c) of this section is guilty of
hazing. A violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the second degree. A violation of division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of
this section is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

who is acting in an official and professional capacity shall recklessly fail to
immediately report the knowledge of hazing to a law enforcement agency in the

      (1)   Any person who is subjected to hazing, as defined in division (a)
hereof, may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and

brought against any participants in the hazing, any organization whose local or
national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.
If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary or post-secondary
school, university, college or any other educational institution, an action may
also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other
educational institution. If an administrator, employee or faculty member is
found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2743, the school, university, college or other educational institution
that employed the administrator, employee or faculty member may also be held
liable.
      (2)   The negligence or consent of the plaintiff or any assumption of the
risk by the plaintiff is not a defense to an action brought pursuant to this
section. In an action against a school, university, college or other
educational institution, it is an affirmative defense that the school,
university, college or other institution was actively enforcing a policy
against hazing at the time the cause of action arose.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

642.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.05,

642.08,
642.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.15 or
642.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
642.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
 642.05 or
642.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.05,
 642.06 or
642.08, Section
642.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.15 or

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If

involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
 
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.

exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
642.24(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
642.24(d), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

         (ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
R.C. § 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this
division (a) and, if the offender is being sentenced for a criminal offense as
defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall sentence the offender to make restitution
pursuant to this division (a) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its
discretion or as required by this division (a), imposes one or more financial
sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this
division (a) include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Restitution.
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.    All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.    All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
 
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a
court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on
the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.02(b). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary
burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. § 2929.21.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(a) and R.C. §§ 2929.25 to 2929.27. A court may impose the longest jail
term authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
         (R.C. § 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section
698.02 hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $ 5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
      (3)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C)
or 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term or sentence of imprisonment
shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term or sentence
of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the state, another
state or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this

served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for

following Customer Service Standards effective ninety days after written notice
of their adoption is given to the provider:
   (a)    Subscriber Complaint Practices.
      (1)    The provider shall maintain a local office which shall be open
during normal business hours at least nine hours per weekday and four hours on
Saturdays. This office shall accept payments, handle adjustments to subscriber
bills and respond to installation, repair, and/or maintenance requests and
other service calls. The provider shall have a publicly-listed toll-free
telephone number and be so operated as to receive subscriber complaints and
requests on a twenty-four hour-a-day, seven days-a-week basis. At least ninety

p.m. on Saturday; 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Sunday; and 10:00 a.m. to 8:00

shall maintain written or computer-generated records demonstrating, to the
satisfaction of the City, its ability to meet the standards in this section. A
written log shall be maintained listing all complaints and their dispositions.
A copy of the written log shall be provided monthly for the Cable Television
Advisory Commission's review at the Commission's periodic meetings.

vintage shall display programming available on the local cable system, allowing
subscribers to view a properly received cable picture.

occur during periods of minimum use of the system. A written log available for
City inspection shall be maintained for all service interruptions.
      (4)    The provider shall maintain adequate telephone lines and trained
personnel to respond in a timely manner to schedule service calls and answer
subscriber complaints or inquiries as required by this section.
      (5)    Work on subscriber requests for maintenance or repairs received
prior to 12:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, shall be commenced the same day.

subscriber.

service interruption which is governed by paragraphs (a)(10) and (11) hereof)
within twenty-four hours after the provider receives notification of a service
problem, the provider shall credit one-fifteenth of the monthly charge for the
affected tier or premium channel to the subscriber for each twenty-four hours
or fraction thereof after the first twenty-four hours during which a subscriber
is with reduced service. The credit shall be made automatically by the provider
without requiring a subscriber request. The provider shall, as part of the
complaint log to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) hereof, inform the
Cable Television Advisory Commission, on a monthly basis, regarding the
disposition of all credits provided by the provider to subscribers pursuant to
paragraph (a)(9) hereof.
      (10)    The provider shall respond within two hours to all service
interruption reports affecting at least one channel for five percent or more of
the system's subscribers.

subscribers affected by the service interruption for each twelve hours or
fraction thereof after the first twelve hours during which the subscriber is
with reduced service.
   (b)    Installation.

subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the
subscriber shall be contacted. The appointment shall be rescheduled, as
necessary, at a time which is convenient to the subscriber.
      (2)    Unless otherwise required by law, only those homes which require
drops in excess of 125 feet shall be required to pay for the provider's
materials and time at the rate per foot. All other installations shall be
performed at the advertised installation rate. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the term "drop" shall mean the shortest linear distance from the
distribution line to the nearest point of the home.
   (c)    Subscriber Information. The provider shall provide to the City and
all new subscribers and, at least once a year, to existing subscribers, written

delinquency; availability of credits for service outages; procedures to be
followed to request service deletions, including the notice period a subscriber
must give to avoid liability for such services; and procedures to be followed
in the event of a billing dispute.
      (2)    The provider shall notify all affected subscribers not less than
thirty days prior to any change in the billing practices and such notice shall
include a description of the changed practice.
      (3)    The subscriber bill shall contain the following information,
presented in plain language and format and in conspicuous print:

         B.    The period of time over which each chargeable service is billed,
including prorated periods as a result of the establishment and termination of

of late charges on subscribers:

unless subscriber is delinquent, the provider has given the subscriber written
notice of the delinquency in a clear and conspicuous manner, and the subscriber

pay the balance due.
         B.    The total late charge for any delinquent bill should not exceed
five percent of the amount of the delinquent bill.
         C.    No late charge may be assessed on the amount of a bill in
dispute if found in favor of the subscriber.
         D.    Any charge for returned checks shall be reasonably related to
the costs incurred by the provider in processing such checks.
      (5)    In the event the provider provides bills, statements, invoices, or
notices to subscribers which separately itemize the portion or portions of the
provider's charges which are attributed to any tax or fee, the itemization
format first shall be reviewed by the City. At a minimum, if the provider
itemizes any tax or fee on a subscriber's bill, the provider shall itemize all
of its taxes or fees in a like manner. In no event shall any such itemization
by the provider be inconsistent with applicable law.
      (6)    Service to subscribers with delinquent accounts may be terminated

all subscribers who wish to be able to delete any objectionable programming
from the able service entering the subscriber's home.
   (f)    Charges for Disconnection or Downgrading of Service. 
      (1)    The provider may impose a charge reasonably related to the
provider's actual cost incurred for a downgrade of service, except that no such
charge may be imposed when:
         A.    A subscriber requests total disconnection from the system; or
         B.    A subscriber requests the downgrade within a thirty-day period
following any rate increase relative to the service in question.
      (2)    If a subscriber requests disconnection from service prior to the
effective date of an increase in rates, the subscriber shall not be charged the
increased rate if the provider fails to disconnect service prior to the
effective date. Any subscriber who has paid in advance for the next billing
period and who requests disconnection from service shall receive a prorated
refund of any amounts paid in advance.
   (g)    Orders and Penalties. The Cable Television Advisory Commission may
make orders and assess monetary penalties against the provider for violation of
any of the Customer Service Standards set forth herein. The order may require
the provider to undertake an activity which the provider is required to
undertake pursuant to these Customer Service Standards and may assess a penalty
not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) per day for each day that the
provider fails to comply with the order.
      (Ord. 1997-45. Passed 12-17-97.)

programming services, as defined by the 1992 Cable Act and applicable FCC
regulations, shall, to the extent permissible, be subject to regulation by the
City in a manner provided by this section.
   (b)    Procedure for Establishing Initial Rates and Approving Rate Changes. 
      (1)    The City hereby adopts and shall follow the rules relating to
cable rate regulation promulgated by the FCC at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart
N. Prior to approving or disapproving any rates, the City shall provide an
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.
      (2)    Within thirty days after receipt of a notice from the City of the
City's certification by the FCC to regulate rates, the provider shall have
thirty days to respond with rate and benchmark information to justify its
initial benchmark rate and any subsequent increases that took place leading to
the rate current at the time of the City's certification utilizing the
appropriate official FCC form(s).
      (3)    The provider shall file all rate justifications subsequent to the
City's certification within the time frames provided by FCC regulations for the
given type of FCC filing or cost of service showing submitted by the provider.
      (4)    The initial rate and/or subsequent rate increases that are
determined to be within the FCC's standards may take effect pursuant to the
time frames provided for in the FCC's regulations.
      (5)    The City shall conduct its evaluation of whether the proposed rate
at issue is appropriate pursuant to FCC regulations and may avail itself of
whatever additional periods of time are permitted by the FCC and are necessary
to complete that evaluation.
      (6)    The City shall, in all cases, issue a written decision to approve
the proposed rates and charges, disapprove the proposed rates and charges or
continue its review pursuant to FCC regulations.
      (7)    If any rate and/or charge is in excess of the FCC's standards, the
City may order that such rate and/or charge be reduced and the City may order a
refund of the amounts collected in excess of the permitted rate pursuant to
applicable FCC regulations.
      (8)    After the City determines that the initial rate, or current rate
at the time of the City's certification, is appropriate pursuant to FCC
regulations, the provider shall, in conjunction with each change in the rate
and charges applicable to basic cable service, conform to the standards of the
FCC. Before any rate change is effective, the provider shall notify the City of
its proposed rate change pursuant to FCC regulations.
      (9)    To the extent specifically permitted by Federal law and applicable
FCC rules, the provider may appeal to the FCC for a review of the decision of
the City.
   (c)    Rate Consultant: Review of Rates. 
      (1)    The City may utilize a rate consultant to advise it on proposed
rate changes and to assist it in the procedures and standards for review
adopted by the FCC. A rate consultant may be any person who has sufficient
background and experience, in the sole opinion of the City, to properly
evaluate and analyze rates and charges.
      (2)    All costs for the review of initial rates or rate changes shall be
paid by the provider upon demand of the City, unless contrary to applicable
rules of the FCC governing these procedures or unless otherwise specifically
preempted by State or Federal law. The costs shall include, but not be limited
to, rate consultants, attorney's fees and the reasonable value of services (as
determined by the City) rendered by the City or any City employees, agents, or
representatives of the City.

820.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and gas
wells within the municipality. Toward that end, this ordinance has been adopted
to supplement any state issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil
and gas well within the municipality. The provisions of this ordinance are
based upon local conditions which may not have been known to the state at the
time such drilling was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the
municipality to exercise its local police authority, authorized under Article
XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by
law for the protection of the municipality’s residents and all emergency
personnel who may be called upon to respond to an incident at an oil and gas
well.

820.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.

Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Fire Chief at least forty-eight (48)

Building Inspector or Fire Chief, as designated herein), shall provide written
notice to the owner of the property and the Permit Holder within forty-eight
(48) hours of the discovery of such failure to comply. Such service shall be

the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to Municipality.

(Ord. 2005-15. Passed 2-16-05.)
890.05 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)    Method of Determination.
      (1)    The portion of the entire net profit of a taxpayer to be allocated
as having been derived from within the City, shall be determined as follows:
Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
         A.    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City, during the taxable period, to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer, and the value of such property shall be determined
by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City, to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City, to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)    In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not
produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted so as to produce such result.
If the Tax Administrator approves the use of books and records as a substitute
method, the following shall apply:
         A.   The net profits allocable to the Municipality from business,
professional or other activities conducted in the Municipality by corporations
or unincorporated entities (whether resident or nonresident) may be determined
from the records of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is
attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the Municipality.
         B.   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis
for apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining
the manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable
the Tax Administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the
Municipality are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
         C.   In determining the income allocable to the Municipality from the
books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution
made to the production of such income by headquarters activities of the
taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the Municipality.
   (b)    Definition of Sales Made in the City. As used in paragraph (a)(1)C.
hereof, “sales” made in the City means:
      (1)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the City.
      (2)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside of the City, regardless of where
title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)    Total Allocation. Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with paragraphs (a)(l)A., B. and C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total
so obtained by the number of percentages used in deriving said total in order
to obtain the business allocation percentage referred to in subsection (a)
hereof A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside of the City.
   (d)    Rentals.
      (1)    Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
890.03(g) to (k) only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)    Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax, provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, and provided, further, that in the case of farm property, the owner
shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts
derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds said two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, and provided, further, that the person who
operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
      (3)    The taxpayers subject to the provisions of this section shall
submit or cause to be submitted to the Tax Administrator a list of names and
addresses of all persons occupying, leasing, renting or otherwise using any
premises belonging to the taxpayer within this City in such a manner as to
produce economic benefit to the taxpayer, whether or not such benefit is
collected as “rent” and whether or not such benefit results in a profit or
loss. The required list shall be prepared as of December 31 of each year and
submitted on or before January 31 of the following year and at such other times
as may be prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (e)    Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1972, allocable to the City, may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years, allocable to the City, until
exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)    The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or some other method, or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, he or she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate
to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.

      (1)    The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon.
However, where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, where any portion
of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (c) hereof, or where an income tax has been paid on the same income
to another municipality, credit for the amount so deducted or paid, or credit
to the extent provided for in Section
890.14, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled, under the provisions of this chapter, may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election,
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof), shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (b)    Collection at Source.

within the City, and any income earned outside of the City will be fully taxed
at the same or a higher rate of tax in another municipality. If the estimated
tax for the current year, less the tax to be withheld and less such tax credit,

estimated tax is required.

assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit,

all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal

         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable

deferred compensation plan.

plan.

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business

shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

 891.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
891.12 (A).
          (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 891.04 of this Chapter.

Withholding provisions.
 
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
 891.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
891.01 of this Chapter, of one percent (1.0%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
 
    (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.00.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Municipal Income Tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
          (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
       (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
         (d)   "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services in
a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.
         (e)    "Professional entertainer" means a person who performs services

events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
          (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does
not include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), and (6) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the City if the
employee performed such services in the City on twenty (20) or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20)
days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer
to last more than twenty (20) days" if either of the following applies at the
time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty (20) days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the City and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
 891.04. 
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order
to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property
that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in
that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City
for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
891.02, the employer shall withhold City income tax on all of the employee's
qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the City,
regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
891.04. (Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
 891.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
 
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
 
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
 
   (G)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each individual
income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be completed
and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed
for the filing of state individual income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08
(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality's income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023,
the extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time
to file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of aa Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a Tax Administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
 
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
 891.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
 
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
891.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
 
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
 
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and any of the City's ordinances, resolutions, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
 
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
 
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file a City
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
       (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
 
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
 
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty(180) days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide
such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
 
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred eighty-first
(181st) day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5) year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
 
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
 
    (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 891.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 891.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
891.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
891.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
 
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
891.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
 
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
 
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net
profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the
LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR the tax rate imposed under
this Chapter.
 
   (B)    The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
 
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
 
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

891.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
 
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for

considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.

declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
 
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45%) percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth (9th) month

891.05.
 
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
891.05 for that year.
       (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first (1st) day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first (1st) day of the taxable year.

other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:

whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.21. 
 
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
 
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
891.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on refunds.
 
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by Municipality. If
the City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
 
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
 
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a

return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
 
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
891.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
 
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ($10.00) ten dollars,
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section 891.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
 
   (D)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City income tax return showing income
subject to City income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten ($10.00) dollars.

not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the

shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
 
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
 
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
 
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
 
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-25.
Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
 
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
 
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
 
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty (20%) percent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
 
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
 
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
 
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
 
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
 
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
 
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
 
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
 
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 2015-25. Passed
10-28-15.)

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

891.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
 
Authority.
 
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of

provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
           (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

period of six (6) years following the end of the taxable year to which the
records or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents
to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
 
Identification information.
 
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying

to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
891.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
891.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
 891.19 within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
891.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
 891.99 for a violation of Section
 891.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

subject to appeal. (Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)

the City at any time during their term or in the five (5) years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One (1) member shall be appointed by the
Mayor of the City. This member may be an employee of the City, but may not be

       (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the

the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person

exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
 
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the

appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
 
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax

within sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
 
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the first (1st) day of the hearing unless the parties agree
otherwise.
 
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal
within fifteen (15) days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or
the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination
as provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
 
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2015-25. Passed 10-28-15.)
 
891.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
City, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the administrator
by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed

or be inconsistent with any provision of this Chapter. Taxpayers are hereby
required to comply not only with the requirements of this chapter, but also to

892.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege
to enter into a place. If such charge includes rental of property or services,
it shall be deemed to be an admission charge if so designated, unless the
charge is for rental or services and persons who do not use such property or
services are admitted free. If a lesser charge is made to persons who do not
desire to use the property or services offered, the lesser charge shall
constitute the admission charge. The designation of the charge as a rental or
service charge shall not be construed to avoid the application of the tax if it
is in effect a charge for admission.
   (b)    "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm,
copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
   (c)    "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls,
amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields, baseball
and athletic parks, circuses, side shows, swimming pools, outdoor amusement
parks and such attractions as merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels, dodge’ems, roller
coasters and observation towers.
   (d)    "Treasurer" means the City Treasurer.
892.02 AMOUNTS TO BE LEVIED.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who pays an admission
charge to any place:
   (a)    A tax of three percent on the amounts paid for admission to any
place, including admission by season ticket or subscription. The tax shall
apply to every admission within the City for which a charge is made,
notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right of
admission thereto is made outside of the City;
   (b)   A tax of three percent on the excess of the amounts paid for tickets
or cards of admission to theaters, operas and other places of amusement, sold
at newsstands, hotels and places other than the ticket offices of such
theaters, operas or other places of amusement, over and above the amounts
representing the established price therefor at such ticket offices, such tax to
be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
892.04 by the person selling the ticket;
   (c)    A tax of three percent on the amount paid for admission to any public
performance for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar
entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form of a service
charge, cover charge or other similar charge;
   (d)    A tax of three percent on the amount paid as annual membership dues
by every club or organization maintaining a golf course, and a tax of three
percent on greens fees paid to golf courses either under club or private
ownership.
      (Ord. 1947-41. Passed 9-24-47.)
892.03 ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.
   No tax shall be levied under the provisions of this chapter with respect to
any admission all the proceeds of which inure:
   (a)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
institutions, societies or organizations for the prevention of cruelty to
children or animals, or societies or organizations conducted for the sole
purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving substantial support
from voluntary contributions, or of improving any municipal corporation, or of
maintaining a cooperative or community center moving picture theater, or
swimming pool, if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the benefit of
any private stockholder or individual;
   (b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State, and if no part of their net
earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;
   (c)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military
or naval forces of the United States and are in need;
   (d)    Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire
department of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such
members;
   (e)    Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases where the
admission price is fifty-one cents or more.
   The exemption from tax provided by this section shall, however, not be
allowed in case of admissions to the following, unless exclusively for the
benefit of those organizations set forth in subsection (b) hereof: wrestling
matches; prize fights; boxing, sparring or other pugilistic matches or
exhibitions; any athletic game or exhibition the proceeds of which inure wholly
or partly to the benefit of any high school, academy, preparatory or other
school; cases where the admission price is fifty-one cents or more; or wholly
or partly to the benefit of any college or university. Immediately after the
event for which an exemption from admission tax has been allowed, the treasurer
of the institution, society or organization for whose benefit such event was
held shall file an itemized statement with the Treasurer setting forth the
amount of money actually received by the treasurer together with the expenses
of promoting and conducting such event. Such statement shall be used as a basis
of subsequent requests for exemption from admissions tax for the benefit of
such institution, society or organization, and if such statement shows a
disproportionate expenditure for promoting and conducting such event, in
relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption shal1 thereafter be allowed
to such institution, society or organization. The exemption from tax provided
in this section shall not be allowed to any institution, society or
organization which does not control the sale of admissions to the event for
which the exemption is requested, nor shall any exemption be allowed where
talent, services or other items are compensated for on a percentage basis if
such percentage results in a payment in excess of the flat rate ordinarily
charged for the same talent, services or other items.
892.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under the
provisions of this chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the
person making the admission payment. The tax required to be collected under the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person
required to collect the same until paid to the Treasurer as herein provided.
Any person required to collect the tax imposed under the provisions of this
chapter who fails to collect the same, or having collected the same, fails to
remit the same to the Treasurer in the manner prescribed by this chapter,
whether such failure is the result of his or her own act or the result of acts
or conditions beyond his or her control, shall nevertheless be personally
liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and shall, unless the remittance
is made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of this chapter. The tax
imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission charge is paid
by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be reported and remitted
by the person receiving the tax to the Treasurer in monthly installments and
remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day of the month next
succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is collected or
received, provided that the first return and remittance under this chapter
shall be made on or before November 30, 1947, and shall cover the period from
and including October 1 to and including October 31, or a four or five week
policy month period as the case may be. Payment or remittance of the tax
collected may be made by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise
required by the Treasurer, but payment by check shall not relieve the person
collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the
Treasurer unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount.
The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon
such forms and setting forth such information as the Treasurer may require,
showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he or she is liable for
the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the
Treasurer with a remittance for the amount. However, the Treasurer may, in his
or her discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving
admission payments setting forth such additional information as he or she may
deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement
makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Treasurer shall be
the judge, the Treasurer may require the report and remittance of the admission
tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of the
performance or exhibition, at the conclusion of the series of performances or
exhibitions, or at such other times as the Treasurer shall determine. Failure
to comply with any requirement of the Treasurer as to report and remittance of
the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter. The books, records
and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied shall, as to
admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject to
examination and audit by the Treasurer. If the tax imposed by this chapter is
not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the
rate of one percent per month from the time when the tax became due until paid.
892.05 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION REQUIRED; FEE.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Treasurer, make
application to and procure from the Treasurer a Certificate of Registration,
the fee for which shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00), which Certificate
shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the Certificate is
issued. The Certificate of Registration, or duplicate original copies thereof
to be issued by the Treasurer without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.
892.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
892.04 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted
and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Treasurer of the
issuance of the Certificate and the joint liability for collection and
remittance of such tax.
892.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Treasurer shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the admissions tax. A copy of such rules
and regulations shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in
the City at least once before they shall become effective and copies shall be
printed and made available in the office of the Treasurer. Failure or refusal
to comply with any such rules and regulations shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter.
   Until such time as rules and regulations are promulgated under this section,
the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation, State of Ohio,
relating to admission taxes in effect on August 31, 1947, except as the same
may conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed to be the
rules and regulations hereunder.
892.08 APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Treasurer shall be made to Council, and
Council shall have authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling
appealed from, in conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
892.09 CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS.
   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter, and coming into the possession of
the Treasurer or his or her agents and employees, shall be held confidential.
No disclosures thereof shall be made unless ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction, except, however, that the Treasurer may furnish the Federal
Internal Revenue Service with copies of returns filed.
892.10 MONEYS PAID TO GENERAL FUND.
   All moneys received by the City from the admissions tax levied by the City
shall be paid into the General Fund.
(Ord. 1951-9. Passed 4-4-51.)
892.11 SEPARABILITY.
   The sections of this chapter, and each part of such sections, are hereby
declared to be independent sections or parts of sections, and notwithstanding
any other evidence of legislative intent it is hereby declared to be the
controlling legislative intent that if any provision of such sections or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provision
to any persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held
invalid, shall not be affected thereby. It is hereby declared that this chapter
would have been adopted independently of such section, sections or parts of a
section so held to be invalid.
(Ord. 1947-41. Passed 9-24-47.)
892.12 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax herein levied and imposed shall be collected and paid on and after
October 1, 1947. (Ord. 1947-41. Passed 9-24-47.)
892.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever, being a person charged by this chapter with the duty of
collecting or paying the taxes imposed by this chapter, willfully fails or
refuses to charge and collect or to pay such taxes or to make return to the
Treasurer as required by this chapter, or to permit the Treasurer or his or her
duly authorized agent to examine his or her books and other records in or upon
any premises where the same are kept, to the extent necessary to verify any
return made or to ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if no
return was made, or to maintain and keep for three years or such lesser or
greater time as may be permitted or required by the Treasurer, shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two

606.08 and

1242.01 MODIFICATIONS.
   Where the City Planning Commission finds that the land involved in a
subdivision is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitations,
or is affected by such topographical conditions, or is to be devoted to such
usage, that it is impossible or impracticable in the particular proposal for
the developer to conform fully to a provision of these Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations, the Commission may accept such modification as may be
reasonable if it is within the general intent and purpose of these Regulations.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1242.02 APPEALS.
   A developer aggrieved by any action of the City Planning Commission and
Council in regard to refusal to approve a subdivision may, within sixty days
after such final refusal, appeal to the appropriate court to correct errors of
law or questions of fact.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1242.03 PLATTING OF UNSUBDIVIDED OR IMPROPERLY SUBDIVIDED AREAS; ISSUANCE OF
BUILDING PERMITS.
   The City Planning Commission may, pursuant to the authority of Ohio R.C.
Chapters 713 and 735, prepare plans of unsubdivided or improperly subdivided
areas showing a pattern of future streets and public open spaces. After the
proper public hearing, such plans or parts thereof may be adopted by the
Commission and recorded, and thereafter no subdivision may be approved and no
street may be accepted or improved unless it conforms substantially to such
recorded plan. No application for a permit to construct a building on land
shown within the right of way of a planned street shall be issued until such
land has been acquired or reserved for street purposes, but such permit may not
be withheld for a period exceeding ninety days.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1242.04 SCHEDULE OF FEES AND DEPOSITS.
   (a)    Plan and Plat Approval. At the time of filing the application for
approval of any plat or development plan, and at the time when plans and
specifications for any improvements are submitted to the Planning Commission
for approval, there shall be paid to the Treasurer a filing fee and a deposit
of money, as hereinafter set forth, to ensure the payment by the applicant of
all expenses incurred by the City in the processing of the application and all
pertinent papers connected therewith.
   The cost and expense of any investigation which may be necessary by the City
Engineer, the Law Director and other City officials, to determine whether or
not such proposed subdivision or development plan is in accordance with law,
and whether or not its improvements, if any, have been made or are being made
in accordance with the requirements of the City, the cost of any and all
notices required, and all other necessary expenses, shall be paid from the
deposit.
   In the event that the actual expenditures exceed such deposit, the excess
shall be paid by the applicant upon demand of the Treasurer. If such
expenditures are less than the required deposit, the balance shall be refunded
to the applicant upon the completion of all administrative proceedings involved
in connection with the plat. No filing fee shall be refunded or returned. No
building permits shall be issued until any excess required to be paid by the
applicant has been deposited. The fees of the Engineer shall be based upon the
ordinance governing fees and rates of compensation for the City Engineer.
   (b)    Recording Expenses. Any person desiring to improve or develop land in
the City shall prepare, execute and deliver to the Clerk of Council the
instruments necessary to carry out the improvements, as required by the rules,
regulations and ordinances of the City, at the cost and expense of the
developer.
   At the time the application for the approval of such improvements is
requested, the applicant shall also deposit funds to pay the cost and expense
of recording the documents necessary for such improvements, as follows:
 
Plats                $50.00
Deeds, easements and other
similar instruments referring
to an interest in land       2.00 per page
 
   The funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the
General Fund of the City.
(Ord. 1972-61. Passed 11-15-72.)
1242.05 IMPROVEMENTS TO BE INSTALLED; LAND TRANSFER BEFORE RECORDING;
FORFEITURE.
   (a)   Required Improvements to be Installed. The public utilities and other
required improvements deemed necessary in the public interest and essential for
appropriate services and access to the lot shall be installed or their
installation guaranteed, in conformance with the provisions of this chapter,
before the issuance of a permit to construct a building upon a lot and before
the sale or lease of a lot.
   (b)    Transfer of Land Before Recording. Whoever, being the owner or agent
of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of these Subdivision
and Land Development Regulations, willfully transfers any lot or parcel of such
land from or in accordance with any plat of a subdivision before such plat has
been recorded, shall forfeit and pay a sum of not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each lot or parcel
of land sold. The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the
deed of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the forfeiture
herein provided. The City may enjoin such sale or agreement by a civil action
in any court of competent jurisdiction.
   The sale of lots or parcels from a plat of a subdivision on which any and
all areas indicated as streets or as open ground are expressly indicated as for
the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such subdivision and not
as public streets, ways or grounds, shall not serve to exempt the seller from
the requirements of these Regulations or from the forfeiture herein provided.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1242.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of these Subdivision and Land Development
Regulations, or fails to comply with any order issued pursuant thereto, shall
be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than one thousand dollars

1244.01 INTENT.
   The procedures established in these Regulations are intended to define the
steps by which a developer may design, make an application, record plats and
construct improvements, and by which the City Planning Commission and Council
may review, make recommendations, approve the plans and otherwise administer
these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1244.02 PRE-APPLICATION.
   The City shall make available to developers copies of these Subdivision and
Land Development Regulations, the Zoning Code and other adopted plans, street
maps and information which may affect the development of the property under
consideration. Applications for approval of a subdivision shall be in
accordance with these Regulations, other codes and plans as adopted and
information furnished.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1244.03 PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)    Application. A written application for approval and three black-on-
white prints of a preliminary plan and profiles of all streets, plotted on a
topographic map, complying with the requirements set forth in Section
1252.02, shall be submitted to Council for each proposed subdivision. The
purposes of the preliminary plan are to explore the best design for the
subdivision and the best relationship to adjoining subdivisions or undeveloped
land, to outline a program of improvements and obtain the advice, suggestions
and requirements of the departments of the City and the City Planning
Commission before the plan becomes rigid as in a detailed drawing. The
submittal of alternative plans is recommended.
   (b)    Council Action. 
      (1)    Council shall examine the preliminary plans at the next regular
meeting of Council, giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard and to
explain any questions concerning the plan.
      (2)    Thereafter, the Clerk of Council shall forward one print of the
preliminary plan and profiles to the City Engineer who will check the same
against all requirements provided for in these Subdivision and Land Development
Regulations and all other ordinances of the City. The Engineer shall, within
two weeks, return the print to the Clerk of Council together with his or her
comments and recommendations.
      (3)    Council shall then have an opportunity to re-examine the plan,
together with the report of the Engineer thereon, and it may then refer the
plan to the Planning Commission.
         (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
   (c)    Planning Commission Action. 
      (1)    When the Secretary of the Planning Commission receives an
application for approval of a preliminary plan from Council, together with the
report of the Engineer thereon, and any recommendations concerning the plan
which Council may make, the Secretary shall give public notice by one
publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the City not less than
one week nor more than six weeks before the meeting of the date at which the
preliminary plan and profiles of the proposed subdivision shall be considered
by the Commission so that all interested parties may attend the meeting.
         (Ord. 1968-59. Passed 9-18-68.)
      (2)    For all subdivisions which are of such scope or at such locations
as to affect the design of an integrated neighborhood street pattern or
extensions to adjoining unsubdivided land, as to include public sites or as to
involve topographic or other unusual conditions, the Commission may request
Council to obtain an analysis and recommendation from a professional land
planner, civil engineer or landscape architect who is experienced in planning
the type of subdivision under consideration, and who has no interest in the
proposed subdivision. If Council approves the request and obtains such
professional advice, the Commission shall review the aforesaid analysis and
recommendations and determine if the preliminary plan embraces all the
applicable planning principles and other provisions of these Regulations as
well as other ordinances of the City.
      (3)    If the Commission finds that the proposal is the best plan
possible under the circumstances and acts favorably, the Chairperson and
Secretary shall affx their signatures to two copies of the preliminary plan and
profiles with a notation that the same have received approval, along with any
special conditions. The Secretary shall then deliver one of the copies to the
Clerk of Council and retain the other copy.
      (4)    If the Commission acts unfavorably, it shall state in writing the
conditions to be complied with before approval may be given, or it may redesign
and recommend an alternative plan to the developer. The Commission shall act
within one month from the date of the meeting at which the application and all
required maps, plans and data were received, or within a mutually agreed upon
extension; otherwise the preliminary plan and profiles shall be deemed to have
been approved.
   (d)    Further Council Action. 
      (1)    If the vote of the Commission is to approve the preliminary plan
and profiles, the Secretary of the Commission shall deliver the plan and
profiles to Council with a written report of its action. If the vote of the
Commission is to disapprove, its action is final unless the owner elects to
appeal the adverse report to Council within twenty days after the decision of
the Commission.
      (2)    If the report of the Commission is favorable, Council may, by
record vote, approve or disapprove the plan by majority vote. If the vote of
the Commission is not to approve the plan, Council can only approve the plan by
a three-fourths vote. All actions by both the Commission and Council shall be
made a matter of their minutes of that meeting.
   (e)    Effect of Approval. The approval of the preliminary plan by the
Planning Commission and Council shall assure the developer for a one-year
period from the date of approval:
      (1)    That the general layout of streets, lots and other features is
approved and has been established as the basis for the preparation of the final
plat;
      (2)    That the general terms and any special conditions under which the
approval of the plan was granted will not be changed unless additional
information or data are received in the meantime that would indicate that
changes should be effected; and
      (3)    That the developer may submit drawings and specifications for
improvements and a final plat for the whole or part of the subdivision.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1244.04 FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Application. An application for approval of a final plat shall be
submitted in writing to the Clerk of Council. The application shall include the
original tracing of the final plat, the original tracing of the drawings for
the required improvements, three black-on-white prints of each tracing, three
sets of specifications and profiles and other maps, data and certificates as
set forth in Section
1252.03.
   The developer may obtain conditional approval of the plat and install the
required improvements before applying for approval of the final plat, or,
alternatively, he or she may apply for approval of the final plat and drawings
and specifications of required improvements concurrently and furnish
performance guarantees that he or she will install the improvements thereafter.
And, if approved, the developer may construct parts of the improvements before
approval of the final plat and furnish performance guarantees for the
construction of the remaining improvements.
   The developer may apply for final plat approval of only that section of an
approved preliminary plan of a subdivision which he or she proposed to develop
and/or record as the first stage. However, the preliminary approval of any
section shall become null and void if an application for final approval of the
plat is not submitted within one year after approval of the preliminary plan,
unless an extension of time is granted by the City Planning Commission.
   (b)    Review by City Engineer. The Clerk of Council shall transmit three
prints of each drawing and the specifications to the Engineer for determination
if:
      (1)    The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plans and any
special conditions or modification stipulated, and mathematical data and
computations are correct; and
      (2)    The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on
the drawings, profiles and specifications are in conformance with any master
plan for streets and utilities and the construction standards in effect in the
City.
   One copy of each set of prints and specifcations shall be returned to
Council by its next regular meeting indicating the Engineer's determinations.
   (c)    Council Action on Final Plat. If the Engineer finds the final plat,
drawings, profiles and specifications are satisfactory in regard to the
aforesaid provisions, and if the subdivision complies with all other applicable
provisions of these Subdivision and Land Development Regulations, Council shall
approve it. Action shall be taken within sixty days after the meeting at which
the application for approval and all required plats, maps and data were
submitted to Council or within a mutually agreed upon extension; otherwise the
plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
   Council shall act upon the final plat, drawings, profiles and
specifications, either separately or concurrently, but in no event shall it
approve the final plat for recording until the improvements are constructed or
their construction guaranteed.
   (d)    Form of Approval. The approval of the final plat shall be indicated
by a certification to that effect on the original tracing of the plat with the
signature of the Secretary of the Commission and the City Engineer. Such final
plat shall also be approved by resolution of Council and such approval shall be
endorsed thereon by the Clerk indicating the number of the resolution and the
date of passage before approval by the City shall be effective. The Commission
shall obtain one duplicate tracing thereof at the developer's expense before
returning the tracing to him or her. The reason for disapproval of a plat shall
be stated in the records of the Commission.
   The approval of the drawings, profiles and specifications for the required
improvements shall be indicated by a certificate to that effect on the original
drawings and specifcations with the signature of the Engineer. Approval of the
improvements as constructed shall likewise be certified by the Engineer.
   (e)    Recording. The developer shall file the approved final plat in the
office of the County Recorder. Approval by the City shall expire within sixty
days after the final action by Council unless within that period the plat shall
have been duly filed and recorded and the Commission so notified by the
developer. If the final plat is revised in any manner after approval, the
approval shall be null and void.
   (f)    Effect of Approval and Recording. If drawings, profiles and
specifications for improvements are approved, the construction of the same may
be started. After satisfactory construction the final plat may be approved and
recorded, building permits may be issued and lots may be sold, leased or
transferred.
   If drawings and specifications for improvements are approved and
construction guaranteed, the final plat may be approved for record purposes
only and recorded, construction of improvements may be started, building
permits may be issued and lots may be sold, leased or transferred.
   Occupancy permits for a building shall not be issued until streets and
utilities are accepted by the City for public use.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1244.05 LANDS FOR PUBLIC USE; OTHER DEVELOPMENTS; TITLE INSURANCE.
   (a)   Dedication for Public Use. If the final plat indicates land for public
use, Council shall also act upon the acceptance of dedication of any public
land and acceptance of any easement before it is recorded. The acceptance of
any street or utility for public use and maintenance shall be by separate
action of Council and shall not be taken until all improvements have been
constructed to the full satisfaction of Council and the City Engineer.
   As soon as all improvements have been so constructed, the owner shall file
with the Law Director a certificate of title insurance in the amount of at
least one thousand dollars ($1,000), meeting with the approval of the Law
Director, showing title to the street, streets or other public land in the
subdivision good in the City for the appropriate purposes and uses, which title
is to be free and clear of all encumbrances whatsoever. Council shall then
approve the plat for dedicating the street areas, accept the streets as public
highways and release all bonds.
   (b)    Land Reserved for Public Use. The City may request, by resolution, a
developer to set aside, reserve or offer for sale, land for streets, parks,
playgrounds or other public uses shown upon a duly approved thoroughfare, park
and recreation or comprehensive plan for a period of ninety days after the
application for approval of a preliminary plan, or for a longer period as may
be mutually agreed, to allow the City time to acquire such land.
   During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees or topsoil shall
be removed or destroyed, no grading shall be done, and no land so reserved
shall be put to any use whatsoever, except on written approval of the City
Planning Commission.
   (c)    Other Developments. An application and preliminary plan shall be
submitted by the developer to Council for all proposals for other developments
or subdivisions involving open spaces for common use or extension of public
facilities. All procedures, maps, plans, profiles and other data required by
Chapter
1252 for preliminary plans, and set forth in Section
1252.02 shall be complied with and furnished if determined applicable by
Council.
   Where streets or other areas are to be used by the public and public
utilities are to be constructed, all procedures, maps and other data required
by Chapter
1252 for final plats, as set forth in Section
1252.03, shall be complied with and furnished if determined applicable by
Council.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1244.06 RESUBDIVIDING OR VACATION.
   An application for resubdividing, replatting or vacation of a subdivision
shall be made by the owner or owners thereof to Council in the same form as for
an original subdivision along with all required maps and other information. The
original lots shall be shown by dotted lines and lot numbers and other
references made to the previously recorded subdivision. If approved by the
City, replatting and vacation actions required by Ohio R.C. 711.17 to 711.31,
inclusive, shall be submitted to the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)

1246.01 INTENT.
   The planning principles established in this chapter are intended to be
fundamental principles to be applied with professional skill in the planning of
land so as to produce attractive and harmonious neighborhoods, convenient and
safe streets and economical layouts of residential and other land development.
   Since these provisions are principles instead of specific regulations as set
forth in other sections, and being inclusive, it may not be possible to
incorporate all the principles in each subdivision, especially small
developments. However, the City Planning Commission shall determine if certain
principles are not applicable. Alternative designs should be thoroughly studied
to obtain the best plan to assure stable and high value neighborhoods.
   If a comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan or plan for the parks and other
open areas has been adopted, the streets, school sites, public parks and all
other land uses shown thereon shall be incorporated in the subdivision plans.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1246.02 TOPOGRAPHY.
   Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the
land in order to utilize the natural contours and economize in the construction
of drainage facilities, reduce the amount of grading and minimize destruction
of trees and topsoil. The natural features and other distinctive
characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create
functional variations in the neighborhoods. Topographic maps shall be utilized
in the land planning.
   (a)   Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat or of very
gentle slopes shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage
courses, and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade. On more
irregular topography, streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts and
fills and follow the ridges, or planned approximately parallel to contour
lines, adjusted, however, so that lots on one side of the street will not be
excessively below the street grade. Where it may be necessary, because of
limitations of site dimensions to plan streets approximately perpendicular to
the contour lines, more extensive grading shall be required.
   (b)    Natural Drainage. Subdivisions shall be designed, particularly on
land of very gentle slopes, to take every advantage of natural grades so that
all the land can be drained without excessive grading. Unless watercourses or
drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines
are approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only
where such a plan is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an
open drainage course. Easements for drainage ways and low-lying land which is
subject to flooding may not be included in calculating the required lot area or
width.
   (c)    Natural Features. Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, lakes, hilltops and other focal points within the site, and distant
views outside the subdivision, shall be integrated in the design to obtain
natural variations and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive
building sites. Trees, topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved
and utilized in the development of the subdivision.
      (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1246.03 STREET PLANNING.
   In addition to relating streets to topography as suggested in Section
1246.02, streets shall be designed according to the function served, the use of
abutting land and standards of width, intersections, maximum grades and
curvatures, as set forth in the following subsections.
   (a)    Major streets function primarily for the movement of fast traffic
between points of heavy traffic generation and, unless shown otherwise on the
Thoroughfare Plan, they shall be planned for continuation of existing streets
in the system at the same width or greater width in accordance with adopted
Municipal standards. Major streets shall contain as few intersections as
possible. Where a subdivision of one- family dwellings adjoins a major street,
the City Planning Commission may require the developer to prepare sketches and
estimates of a plan based on marginal access streets or such treatment as the
fronting of lots on perpendicular local streets in order to protect the
residential property from the movement of heavy traffic and eliminate driveways
cutting into a major street. The Commission may require a plan wherein lots do
not have direct access onto the major street or require a setback of such depth
that marginal streets can be constructed in the future.
   (b)    Secondary streets function for collecting traffic from local streets
and distributing it onto major streets. They will normally contain a relatively
large number of intersections with local streets and few with main streets.
Secondary streets shall be planned for continuity and to lead more or less
directly to one or more focal points or centers of traffic generation.
   (c)    Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot. They
shall be planned for convenient circulation toward the principal directions of
travel, bus routes, schools and playgrounds. The layout shall be related to the
topography and natural features. The street pattern shall be indirect and yet
continuous to prevent through traffic; formed of straight, moderately curved,
loop, angular or ell streets. Tee- intersections shall predominate, cross-
intersections shall be avoided. There shall be an underlying systematic
neighborhood pattern, except that gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns
shall be avoided. The street pattern shall include extensions to the boundaries
of the development to provide circulation between adjoining neighborhoods.
   (d)    Pedestrian ways of not less than twenty-five feet right of way, and
in a straight line, may be required across blocks exceeding 1,500 feet in
length or at the end of cul-de-sac streets for access to schools, playgrounds,
bus stops or other public facilities where convenient pedestrian circulation
has not been provided by streets.
   (e)    Street extensions shall be planned where a subdivision adjoins
unsubdivided land. Certain streets shall extend to the boundary lines so that
all parcels may be subdivided and a coordinated street system obtained. A
temporary turnaround or background shall be provided for each street extension
if it is more than 200 feet in length and if lots front thereon. Provision
shall be made for future extension of the street and utilities and such
provision shall be noted on the final plat.
   (f)    Reserve strips adjoining streets, or other provisions to control
access or extensions to pavement and/or utilities to a nearby property, shall
not be permitted except where the control and disposal of land comprising such
strips has been assigned to the City under conditions approved by the
Commission.
   (g)    Intersections of streets shall be designed to be as nearly at ninety
degrees as possible, and no street shall intersect another at less than sixty
degrees. The intersection of more than two streets at a point or with center
line offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. Property lines at
street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of not less than thirty
feet for major streets and twenty feet for secondary streets and for local
streets.
   (h)    Right-of-way widths shall be as follows.
      (1)    Local streets. Right-of-way widths shall not be less than the
following:
         A.    Non-through streets, less than 1,500 feet in length: sixty-foot
right of way.
         B.    Through streets or non-through streets longer than 1,500 feet,
and where extra width is necessary for grading or placement of utilities:
sixty-foot right of way.
         C.    Cul-de-sac, less than 500 feet in length: sixty-foot right of
way; more than 500 feet but less than 1,000 feet in length: sixty-foot right of
way. Turnaround: pavement outside diameter-ninety feet; property line diameter-
130 feet; or such larger diameters as may be required by the City Engineer
based upon the proposed usage.
      (2)    Secondary streets. The right of way shall be in accordance with
the thoroughfare plans and standards and may vary from sixty to eighty feet.
      (3)    Major streets. The right of way shall be in accordance with State
highway or County or Municipal thoroughfare plans and standards, and may vary
from eighty to 120 feet.
   (i)    Grades of streets in vertical alignment shall not exceed ten percent
for local streets, seven percent for secondary streets and six percent for
major streets. Street grades shall be not less than one-half percent in order
to provide adequate surface drainage.
   All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves, and the rate of
change of grade shall not exceed four percent per 100 feet. Streets shall level
off to a grade not exceeding three percent for a distance of not less than
seventy-five feet from each side of an intersection.
   (j)    Angles in the alignment of street lines, horizontal alignment, shall
be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not less than 200
feet for local streets.
   (k)    Street names shall be selected which will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in Cuyahoga County irrespective of
modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. Streets that are or
will eventually be continuations of existing or platted streets shall be named
the same as such streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
Council.
      (Ord. 1975-26. Passed 4-2-75.)
1246.04 LOT DESIGN.
   Each lot shall form a good site for the type of building to be developed,
and the lot lines shall not be considered as merely forming a geometric shape
which encloses the minimum area permitted. The lots shall be more or less
rectangular in form; triangular lots or lots with acute angles, broken
boundaries or other shapes that restrict the use of a lot as a building site
shall be avoided.
   (a)    The area and width of lots shall be not less than required by the
Zoning Code and shall be appropriate for the neighborhood and type of
development proposed. Easements for drainage ways and land subject to flooding
shall not be included in the determination of lot area or width.
   (b)    Corner lots shall have extra width to obtain the required side yards,
building setback and appropriate orientation to both streets and as may be
required by the Zoning Code. Lots abutting a pedestrian way or easement shall
have extra width.
   (c)    Side lot lines shall be designed to be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines, except that such lines may be
modified to accommodate topography or natural features. At a tee-intersection,
the side lot lines shall be adjusted so that a dwelling site will not be
directly on the projected line of the street which terminates.

chapter and other codes of the City. They shall be installed before the final
plat is approved, or in lieu thereof agreements to install shall be approved
concurrent with the approval of the final plat.
   The developer shall dedicate all land required for rights of way within the
subdivision and furnish and install all improvements to provide a complete and
coordinated system of streets and utilities for the neighborhood, in accordance
with the thoroughfare, water and sewer plans adopted.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.02 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Land for the right of way for the opening or extension of any street
within or on the boundary of the subdivision shall be dedicated by the
developer, and all easements for the extensions of utilities shall be provided.
   (b)    Improvements, such as utilities, pavements, walks and other land
improvements as required by this section, shall be designed, furnished and
installed as hereinafter set forth or required by other codes of the City. The
improvements shall be of such sizes and capacities as are required for the
development of the proposed subdivision and of extra sizes as may be necessary
to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or
drainage areas.
   The developer shall be required to extend the improvements to serve
adjoining subdivided land. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Inspector of Buildings may require the
developer to construct off-site extensions of the improvements.
   (c)    Improvements for the proposed subdivision shall be provided and
installed by the developer as follows:
      (1)    Grading of streets;
      (2)    Drainage facilities for the sewerage system;

      (6)    Monuments.
         (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.03 GRADING.
   The grading of the street shall extend the full width of the right of way.
The City Planning Commission may require that topsoil shall be stripped from
the roadway and construction areas, piled separately but not removed from the
site or used as spoil. It may also require that as many trees as can be
reasonably utilized in the final development plan be retained, and that the
grading be adjusted to the existing grade at the trees.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.04 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot as
follows:
   (a)    An enclosed storm sewer system shall be provided where a tile inlet
or an outlet with a capacity to receive the discharge is available within 2,000
feet of the subdivision or where it is determined by the Planning Commission
that storm sewers shall be provided and connected to a drainage ditch or other
waterway. The system shall have a capacity to serve the subdivision and
drainage area of which it is a part. The system shall include pipes, culverts,
manholes, catch basins, drain inlets and a connection for each lot.
   (b)    The developer may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an
easement to the City for a drainage channel not less in width than required by
a plan or standards adopted by the City, or by the existing topography along
the watercourse. The developer may rechannel any watercourse through his or her
property in order to contain the storm drain flow within a lesser width. The
developer shall be responsible for clearing the drainage way of all debris as a
condition of acceptance.
   (c)    The drainage system shall be designed in accordance with standards of
the City. The developer shall construct and pay for all sewers.
      (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.05 SANITARY FACILITIES.
   Sanitary facilities shall be designed and constructed by the developer for
the proper disposal of wastes for each lot, as follows:
   (a)    Public System. A public sanitary sewer system and a house connection
shall be provided for each lot where the land has access to a sanitary sewage
disposal plant and appropriate connecting mains.
   (b)    Design Standards. The sanitary sewer system shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the standards of the City or as otherwise
provided by law. The developer shall construct and pay for all sanitary sewers.
      (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.06 WATER SUPPLY.
   A water system shall be designed and constructed by the developer and a
supply provided for each lot, as follows:
   (a)    Public Supply. A public water system shall be provided for fire
protection and a house connection for domestic use to serve each lot where the
land has access to connecting water mains.
   (b)    Design Standards. A public water system shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the standards and plans of the City of Cleveland
Water Department and the City.
      (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.07 TELEPHONE SERVICE; GAS MAINS.
   The developer shall make arrangements to have telephone service lines and
gas mains installed and submit drawings to the City Planning Commission for
approval.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.08 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   The developer shall design and furnish pavements and curbs of the sizes and
types set forth in the following schedule:
 
Improvements       One-Family Districts
LOCAL STREET
Pavement width       24 feet
Type             6 inch reinforced concrete with
             integral mountable curbs
SECONDARY STREET
Pavement width       32 feet
Type             7 inch reinforced concrete with
             integral mountable curbs
 
   (a)    Pavements. The width of the pavement shall be measured between the
outside edges of rolled curbs. The Planning Commission may require higher
standards and/or greater widths than set forth above, because of extraordinary
traffic loads or unusual soil conditions in specific locations.
   The preparation of subgrade, the materials and construction of pavement
shall be in accordance with the State of Ohio Department of Transportation
Construction and Material Specifications.
   After the underground utilities and house connections are installed, and
rough grading completed, the roadway subgrade shall be shaped, rolled and
compacted. The developer may construct the final pavement of the reinforced
concrete with integral curbs or may request permission to construct a temporary
pavement of slag or stone for use during the building construction period and
furnish a bond, in the amount required, guaranteeing that all pavements shall
be maintained in a passable and reasonable condition, without expense to the
City, until acceptance of final pavement for maintenance and use by the City.
   (b)    Curbs and Gutters. Mountable concrete curbs and gutters integral with
the pavement shall be provided. Curbs shall be not less than twelve inches wide
and not more than four inches high and shall be formed with a smooth reverse
curve.
   (c)    Driveways. Driveways shall be located in accordance with the
development plan of the block, on the left side of the lot. Generally they
shall be located not less than three feet from the side lot line of another and
shall be not more than sixteen feet wide. The flare for driveways shall be at
least three feet wider than the pavement on each side, the grade of the apron
shall not exceed five percent for a distance of twenty feet from the edge of
the street pavement and the maximum grade of the driveway shall not exceed
fourteen percent.
      (Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.09 MONUMENTS.
   A monument shall be accurately placed at each corner and at changes in
direction of the boundary, at each street intersection, at points of curves of
streets and at intermediate points as may be required by the City Engineer. The
monuments shall be concrete six by six by thirty inches long with an iron pin
in the center or metal monuments as approved by the Engineer. The top of the
monument shall be set at the finished grade upon the completion of the grading
of the streets and the lots.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.10 STREET TREES.
   Street trees, of species which have been determined by the City Planning
Commission to be adaptable to local conditions, resistant to damage and disease
and which cause the least interference with underground utilities and street
lighting, shall be used. At least one tree shall be required for each seventy-
five feet on each side of the street, and if the tree lawn is at least six feet
wide, the tree may be permitted in the tree lawn. Otherwise, it shall be
planted outside the street right of way, at a distance not to exceed three
feet. The minimum size of such street trees shall be at least one and one-half
inches in diameter at six inches above ground level.
   The species of trees shall follow the master street plan of the City, except
where the street plan does not cover the particular street proposed. Trees
recommended for such locations are red maple, Norway maple, sugar maple, red
oak, white oak, thornless honey locust, London plane tree, amur cork tree and
sweet gum.
   Trees which have undesirable characteristics, such as excessively thick
foliage, low branches, unpleasant odors, susceptibility to disease or attack by
insects or large root systems, such as poplar, willow, cottonwood, American
elm, nut and fruit trees, ailanthus, mountain ash and Oregon maple, are
prohibited in tree lawns. Poplar, willow and cottonwood trees, if planted on
private property in the City, shall be located not less than 100 feet from any
public sewer.
   Such trees as are herein provided for in the public rights of way shall be
planted by the City. Prior to the construction of a street by a developer, the
developer shall pay the City seventy- five dollars ($75.00) cash per tree. The
trees shall be planted when the City determines that they will not likely be
injured by further construction work and during such season as will be most
likely to promote their longevity.
(Ord. 1974-7. Passed 4-17-74.)
1248.11 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the owner of the
subdivision if a new street is planned. The letters and numerals shall be
either three or four inches high, set on a reflecting material. The signs shall
be mounted at a height of approximately seven feet above the top of the curb.
Metal posts are desired. Placement of signs shall be in accordance with the
Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways and
placed on diagonally opposite corners, on the far right-hand side of the
intersection for traffic on the more important street, and as close to the
corner as possible.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.12 EXTENSION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    Extensions to Boundaries. The developer shall be required to extend
the improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining
unsubdivided land. However, where the City Planning Commission determines that
a connecting street is necessary for the future subdivision of adjoining land,
but that the present construction of pavement and/or utilities therein is not
warranted, the Commission may require the dedication of land, the construction
of pavement intersections, the extension of utilities at least five feet beyond
the pavement, and provision and availability of connections for future
extension by other developers.
   (b)    Off-Site Extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the City may require, as a condition
precedent to approval of a preliminary plan and final plat, assurances that
such improvement extensions shall be provided. If the Commission finds that
extensions across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special
assessment to the intervening properties or as a Municipal expense until some
future time, the developer may be required, if he or she wishes to proceed with
the development, to obtain necessary easements or rights of way and construct
and pay for extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by
developers of adjoining land.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.13 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The design of the water system, the storm and sanitary sewerage systems and
roadways shall be in accordance with the various standards and requirements
described in Sections
1248.04 through
1248.06 and
1248.08. Drawings and specifications for the improvements shall be reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer, and the installation shall be subject to his or
her continuous inspection.
   At the completion of the construction and before acceptance, the developer
shall furnish the City a set of record or "as-built" tracings showing the
locations, sizes and elevations of all underground utilities.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.14 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION.
   (a)   Type of Guarantees. The developer may execute and file with the City
financial guarantees, in lieu of actual installation or completion of the
required improvements, concurrently with the application for approval of the
final plat. Such guarantees may be in the form of a performance or surety bond,
a certified check or any other type of surety approved by the City.
   (b)    Terms of Guarantees. The terms shall be determined by the Planning
Commission. However, they shall not be for a longer period than eighteen months
unless Council, by resolution, extends the time. Bonds shall be executed by the
applicant as principal with a surety company authorized in the State and shall
be in a form satisfactory to the Director of Law.
   (c)    Amount of Guarantee. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total cost of materials, labor and engineering required
to install or construct the improvements, plus ten percent for contingencies.
Such costs shall be determined by the City Engineer. When any portion of an
improvement has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily completed, a
reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the estimated
costs of such completed improvements may be authorized.
   (d)    Progressive Installation. The developer may apply for final approval
and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such a
progressive unit development procedure, the installation of required
improvements and the sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of
the subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.15 STREET MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   Upon acceptance and as a condition thereof, the developer shall guarantee
the construction and materials of the street improvements and shall maintain
the street improvements for a period of four years from their acceptance and
the posting of the maintenance bond herein required with the City, in a form
approved by the Law Director. The bond shall be in an amount of twenty percent
of the financial guarantees required under Section
1248.14 for the improvements.
(Ord. 1980-7. Passed 4-16-80.)
1248.16 INSURANCE.
   The developer shall indemnify and save harmless the City against and from
any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and expense on account of damage to
property of, or injury to or death of, the parties hereto or a third person,
caused by, growing out of, or in any way whatsoever attributable to, the
construction of the improvements and the use of the street delineated on the
subdivision plat during the construction.
   The developer shall also, but without limiting his or her liability,
indemnify the City by carrying comprehensive general liability insurance
contracts with a reliable insurance company covering the period of construction
in the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) all- occurrence coverage
and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) property damage, which insurance contracts
shall include the City as a named insured. The developer shall maintain on file
with the City during the period of construction, certificates or memoranda of
insurance evidencing that such insurance contracts are in force.
(Ord. 1975-28. Passed 4-2-75.)
1248.17 FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS.
   In the event the developer fails to complete the installation of all land
improvements according to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the City,
upon proper notice, may complete the same and appropriate such portion of money
or bonds posted for the faithful performance of such work as is necessary to
completely reimburse the City for all expenses incurred in connection with such
work.
(Ord. 1962-8. Passed 2-21-62.)
1248.18 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY.
   A building permit may be issued and construction started when all
improvements are completed and accepted.

1262.01 INSPECTOR OF BUILDINGS.
   (a)    The Inspector of Buildings shall cause examination to be made of
every application for a building permit and shall issue no permit for any
building or structure to be built, altered or repaired in violation of this
Zoning Code. No building or structure shall be built, altered or repaired
except after the issuance of such permit, or otherwise than in conformity with

and premises as he or she may find necessary or proper to be inspected in the

structure is being done in violation of this Zoning Code, it shall be unlawful
to proceed further upon such work, and such work shall be suspended forthwith.
   (d)    When any building, structure or premises is being used or occupied in
violation of this Zoning Code, it shall be unlawful to continue such use or
occupancy, and such use or occupancy shall be suspended forthwith.
   (e)    It shall be the duty of the Inspector to notify the owner, or his or
her agent, of such unlawful work, use or occupancy, and to cause a written or
printed notice of the suspension thereof to be posted conspicuously and as near
as practicable to the scene of the unlawful work, use or occupancy. No person
shall remove, deface, cover or conceal such notice or do any further work on
such building or structure, or continue the use or occupancy of such building,
structure or premises, until such notice has been rescinded by the Inspector or
the Planning Commission, provided that the Inspector may direct such covering
or protection to be made as the public safety may require and the person
performing the suspended work, use or occupancy shall immediately make such
covering and protection as directed.
   (f)   Prior to entering any dwelling, multifamily dwelling, building,
structure, or premises within the City to perform any duty imposed on him or
her by law, the Building Inspector, or his or her authorized agents, shall

(Ord. 2017-34. Passed 12-20-17.)

   There are hereby delegated to the City Planning Commission all powers now or
hereafter authorized by law to be delegated to any administrative board with
respect to the enforcement of this Zoning Code, including, without prejudice to
the generality of this delegation, the following powers:
   (a)   The Commission shall hear and determine all appeals from any decision
or action of the Inspector of Buildings in the administration or enforcement of
this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The Commission may, in individual cases, after public notice and
hearing set forth herein and subject to such conditions and safeguards as it
may establish, permit exceptions to and variations from the district
regulations established by this Zoning Code as provided in Section
1262.03 hereof.
   (c)   Permit in a use district as a conditional use, any use determined by
the Commission to be generally in keeping with the uses authorized in such
district. In granting a conditional use the Commission may attach such
stipulations, restrictions, and conditions as it deems necessary and
appropriate to ensure the compatibility of said use in the district.
      (Ord. 2013-13. Passed 9-25-13.)
1262.03 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Application. An application for variance shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission along with the appropriate scheduled fee. The applicant
shall, upon the request of the Building Inspector, submit evidence that the
applicant controls the property by ownership, option or lease. Applicable
plans, drawings, and description of use and the proposed site shall accompany
the application.
 
   (b)   Notice. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on each application
for a variance and shall give at least fourteen (14) days’ notice of the time
and place thereof by electronic mail to individuals and organizations who have
filed a request for such notices with the Clerk of Council and by any two (2)
of the following methods:
      (1)   Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City;
      (2)   Posting on the City website;
      (3)   Posting on the bulletin board at City Hall.
   During such fourteen (14) days, the application, together with any maps,
plans and reports submitted to the Planning Commission, shall be on file for
public examination in the office of the Clerk of Council or in such office as
is designated by the Planning Commission.
   For each variance request, written notice of the hearing shall also be
mailed by the Planning Commission by first class mail at least ten (10) days
before the date of the public hearing to owners of property contiguous to and
directly across the street from the parcel or parcels which are the subject of
such request. Such notice shall be sent to the addresses of owners appearing on
the County’s current tax list or mailing list and to such other list or lists
as may be specified by the Planning Commission. The failure of delivery of such
notice shall not invalidate any such variance.
 
   (c)   Authority. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to:
      (1)   Permit the extension of a building or use into a more restricted
district immediately adjacent thereto, but not more than fifty feet beyond the
boundary line of the district in which such building or use is authorized;
      (2)   Permit the substitution or extension of a non-conforming use or
building upon the lot occupied by such use or building at the time of the
passage of this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Permit such modification of the yard or lo area of width
regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a
parcel of land that is too small to be appropriate improved without such
modification, which parcel was separately owned at the time of passage of this
Zoning Code or is adjacent to buildings that do not conform to the general
restrictions applicable to their location;
      (4)   Permit the erection, in any height district, of a building or
portion of buildings, covering not over twenty-five percent of the area of the
lot, to a height in excess of the limits prescribed in this Zoning Code.
      (5)   Authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, such area variances from
the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where, owing to special conditions or unique circumstances, a literal
enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code will result
in practical difficulty and so that the spirit of this Zoning Code shall be
observed and substantial justice done.
 
   (d)   Findings. The Planning Commission shall consider the following when
making positive findings of fact as to whether or not a practical difficulty
exists for the approval of a variance request:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return and
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial.
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be
substantially altered and whether adjoining properties will suffer interference
with their proper future development and rights as a result of the variance.
      (4)   Whether the variance will adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e. water, sewer, garbage, fire, police or other).
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
      (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament can be obviated through
some other method other than a variance.
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent of the Zoning Code will be observed
and substantial justice done by the granting of the variance.
      (8)   Whether the granting of the variance will be contrary to the
general purpose, intent and objective of the district.
      (9)   Whether the variance request arises from a condition or
circumstance which is unique to the subject site and which is not generally
shared by other properties in the same zoning district or general vicinity;
      (10)   Whether the practical difficulty is created by the Zoning Code and
not by any action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
      (11)   Whether the variance desired will adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
      (12)   Whether the variance requested is the minimum variance necessary
to afford relief to the property owner.
 
   (e)   Action. Actions by the Planning Commission on appeals and variances
shall be made in accordance with Section
1220.02(b).
 
   (f)   Time Limit. Variances shall become null and void if the use is not
established or the building is not completed within one (1) year of the date
the Planning Commission’s action becomes final or such other time frame as the
Planning Commission may establish.
(Ord. 2013-13. Passed 9-25-13.)
1262.99 PENALTY.
   The owner of any building or premises or part thereof where anything in
violation of this Zoning Code is placed or exists, and any architect, builder

   (f)   Planning Commission Review Of Final Development Plans. The Planning
Commission shall review a final development plan to determine if such
application complies with the review criteria set forth below. The Planning
Commission shall take into consideration the comments and recommendation of
staff, consultants end the Architectural Review Board when reviewing the
application. In order to approve a final development plan, the Planning
Commission shall determine that:
      (1)    The plan conforms in all respects to the approved or provisionally
approved general development plan and the applicable regulations of the
Codified Ordinances of Pepper Pike provided, however, that the Planning
Commission may authorize minor changes in the plans as specified in subsection
(j).
      (2)    The design of buildings, location of garages and use of exterior
materials are compatible with the character and quality of the typical single-
family homes currently being approved in Pepper Pike.
(3)    Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property.
      (4)    The development will have adequate public services.
      (5)    The development will provide adequate lighting for safe and
convenient use of the streets, walkways, driveways, and parking areas.
      (6)    The landscape plan will adequately:
         A.    Enhance the proposed dwelling units and site;
         B.    Maintain existing trees to the extent possible;
         C.    Buffer adjacent uses; and
         D.    Provide appropriate plant materials considering the ultimate
mature size and shape of plants relative to the buildings and site, and the
climate of the area, including typical weather conditions.
      (7)    Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and
throughout the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal
swells, watercourses and drainage areas, and shall comply with the applicable
regulations in this Planning and Zoning Code and any other design criteria
established by the City or any other governmental entity which may have
jurisdiction over such matters.
      (8)    The maximum possible privacy for adjacent residential properties
shall be provided through good design and use of the proper building materials
and landscaping.
      (9)    Adequate provisions are made in the final covenants and
restrictions to be imposed upon the development relating to the following:
         A.    The use and development of accessory structures and uses
associated with individual dwelling units; and
         B.    The maintenance of the land, including any common areas, common
drives and sidewalks.
   (g)    Request For Additional Information. In their review of an
application, the Planning Commission may request that the applicant supply
additional information that the Commission deems necessary to adequately review
and evaluate the proposed development.
   (h)    Simultaneous Plat Approval. If the proposed development includes the
subdivision of land, the development shall be subject to the requirements of
the plat approval process in accordance with the Subdivision and Land
Development Regulations. General development plan approval and subdivision plat
approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
   (i)    Action By Planning Commission.
      (1)    For a general or fina1 development plan, the Planning Commission
shall either:
         A.    Approve the development plan as submitted; or
         B.    Approve the plan subject to specific conditions not included in
the plan as submitted to further protect and improve the proposed and
surrounding development; or
         C.    Deny the development plan when the application does not
demonstrate that the required standards have been met.
      (2)    If the Planning Commission fails to act within 90 days from the
date of the Planning Commission meeting after the development plan submitted to
the Planning Commission by the Building Inspector was determined complete, or
an extended period as maybe agreed upon, then the applicant may deem the
development plan denied.
   (j)   Equivalency Considerations. In reviewing the application, the Planning
Commission may find that a final development plan which does not strictly
comply with one or more numerical requirements or one of more of the material
regulations of this Chapter is equivalent to requirements of this Chapter. The
maximum density of Section
1267.04(a) shall not be altered.
      (1)    In making such finding, the Planning Commission may determine that
the elements of a final development plan are equivalent to a numerical
requirement:
         A.   When the proposed final development plan substantially complies
with all specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic
objectives of this Chapter;
         B.    When through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement
of buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, as
disclosed by the application, the proposal results in a development of
equivalent or higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict
application of such standards and requirements; and
         C.    When the development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact
upon the surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare
of the community.
      (2)    When evaluating the application with respect to this section, the
Planning Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in writing which
explains how and why the proposal has satisfied the above criteria. When making
such finding, the Commission may approve the proposed application, including
waivers from the numerical standards herein, as if the application were in
strict compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter, except
that the maximum density of Section
1267.04(a) shall not be altered.
   (k)   Review by Council. When the Planning Commission recommends approval of
a general or final development plan, the recommendation, along with the
application, shall be submitted within 20 days to Council for review.
      (1)    The purpose of Council's review shall be to confirm or deny the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      (2)    Council shall act on the application according to the following:
         A.    Council may, by a majority vote, confirm the recommendation of
the Planning Commission or modification thereof; or
         B.    Council may, by a majority vote, refer the development plan
application back to the Planning Commission for further study and review. Any
additional review shall comply with the time frame allotted in subsection (i)
(2); or
         C.    Council may, by a majority vote of its membership, approve a
modification of the recommendation of the Planning Commission; or
         D.    Council may, by a majority vote of its membership, reject the
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Failure of Council to act within 60 days from the date Planning
Commission makes a recommendation shall be deemed a rejection of the Planning
Commission's recommendation.
   (l)   Significance Of An Approved Plan; Plan Revisions. An approved final
development plan shall become for the proposed development a binding commitment
of the specific elements approved for development. The approved development
plan may be transferred to another person, corporation, or group of individuals
or corporations prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such a transfer
shall occur only upon approval of the Planning Commission and Council. A
request for such a transfer or change of ownership shall be presented to the
Planning Commission and Council and granted only if the new ownership entity
satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all other performance
guarantees approved with the original development plan. All construction and
development under any building permit shall be in accordance with the approved
plan. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the permit.
Any changes in an approved plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (m)    Expiration Of Development Plan Approval. An approved development plan
shall remain valid for a period of 12 months following the date of its
approval, unless the Planning Commission or Council authorizes a longer period
at the time of approval.
      (1)    General development plan. If, at the end of that time, a final
development plan has not been submitted to the Inspector of Buildings, then
approval of the general development plan shall expire and shall be of no effect
unless resubmitted and reapproved in accordance with this Chapter.
      (2)    Final development plan. If, at the end of that time, construction
of the development has not begun, then approval of such final development plan
shall expire and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and reapproved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Chapter. Construction is
deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings of one
or more principal buildings included in the plan have been completed.
   (n)    Revisions To Association Documents Approved By Law Director. Whenever
a homeowners ' association, community association, condominium association or
similar legal entity amends those portions of their recorded instrument, bylaws
or code of regulations that pertain to maintenance obligations or access to
common areas within a townhouse development, such amendment shall be submitted
to the City's Law Director for review and approval. Failure to obtain approval
of such amendment shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2002-38. Passed 8-21-02.)
1267.11 PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE TOWNHOUSE DISTRICT.
   Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
Chapter and those of other sections of this Planning and Zoning Code, the
provisions set forth in chapter prevail.

1268.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of uses,
structures, and lots lawfully established prior to the enactment of this Zoning
Code and amendments hereto but which do not conform to the existing provisions
of this Zoning Code. Such lawfully established uses, structures, and lots may
be continued, despite their nonconforming conditions, subject to the provisions
of this Zoning Code which provide for their completion and continued use, but
also provide for reasonable regulation of their restoration, reconstruction,
extension, and substitution. While it is the intent of this Zoning Code to
permit such nonconforming conditions to continue until abandoned, removed or
abated, a nonconformity is deemed incompatible with currently permitted uses
and requirements in the zoning district and should be discouraged, especially
where such nonconformity constitutes a nuisance or hazard.
(Ord. 2013-11. Passed 9-25-13.)
 
1268.02 NONCONFORMING USE.
   (a)   A use of property that is lawful at the time of the passage of this
Zoning Code (Ord. 1963-59, passed November 20, 1963) or at the time of any
subsequent amendment thereto may be continued, and any building may be used to
the extent that it was designed, arranged and constructed, at the time of the
Code’s passage or amendment, for a non-conforming use.
 
   (b)   A nonconforming use shall not be extended or expanded.
 
   (c)   A nonconforming use shall not be changed, except to a more restricted
use, as defined and established in Chapter
1266, or as provided in this section. This provision is intended to include the
prohibition of a return to a nonconforming use after its change to a more
restricted use.
 
   (d)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of one
(1) year or more, such discontinuance shall be considered conclusive evidence
of an intention to legally abandon the nonconforming use. At the end of the one
(1) year period of abandonment, the nonconforming use shall not be re-
established, and any further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2013-11. Passed 9-25-13.)
 
1268.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE.
   (a)   No building or structure that does not conform with the requirements
of this Zoning Code shall hereafter be extended, structurally altered or
rebuilt, unless the building is changed to make the building more conforming
with the Zoning Code.
 
   (b)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the reconstruction,
repairing, rebuilding, and continued use of any nonconforming building or
structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, acts of God or other casualty,
subsequent to the date of this Zoning Code, provided that not more than fifty
percent (50%) of the value of the building or structure was lost in such damage
event and provided such reconstruction or repair does not extend the
nonconformity and further provided that such replacement or repair occurs
within one (1) year of the date of damage. When more than fifty percent (50%)
of the value of the structure is lost in such damage event, the structure and
use shall not be reconstructed except in a manner conforming with this Zoning
Code.
 
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall prevent routine repairs and maintenance
or the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any lawful authority or officer.
 
   (d)   Notwithstanding division (a) of this section, a building which is
nonconforming solely because of a nonconforming setback may be altered and/or
expanded provided that such alteration and/or expansion does not increase the
area of the nonconformity nor result in a greater nonconformity of setbacks.
(Ord. 2014-30. Passed 6-17-15.)
 
1268.04 NONCONFORMING LOT.
   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all applicable
provisions of this Zoning Code, except that the area of the lot is
nonconforming, then the lot may be used as if its area were conforming. When
conforming use of a nonconforming lot cannot reasonably be established due to
the setback requirements of the district in which it is located, the Planning
Commission may grant variances to setback requirements as necessary to
establish a permitted use of the district, provided that there is no contiguous
land in common ownership with the subject lot which could be used to reduce or
eliminate the nonconformity and the variance meets all other variance standards
of this Zoning Code. (Ord. 2013-11. Passed 9-25-13.)

1269.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these sign regulations is to promote the public health,
safety, and welfare through the provision of size, type, placement, design,
brightness, operation, maintenance, and other standards for existing and
proposed signs as set forth herein and more specifically to:
   (a)   Maintain and enhance the quality of life and property values by
protecting the aesthetic character and visual appearance of the community by
reducing and preventing sign distraction, confusion, clutter and proliferation.
   (b)   Promote the safety of persons and property and maintain a safe and
orderly vehicular and pedestrian environment by eliminating the hazards to
drivers and pedestrians caused by signs that are distracting, confusing,
illegible, or which obstruct sight lines.
   (c)   Recognize that signs are as much subject to control as noise, odors,
debris, and other similar characteristics of land use that, if not regulated,
can become a nuisance to and depreciate the value of adjacent properties or the
community in general. It is further declared that the regulations contained in
this chapter are the minimum regulation necessary to achieve the purposes of
this chapter.
   (d)   Provide review procedures that enable the City to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of a sign to the site, building, and surroundings.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 5-25-16; Ord. 2024-18. Passed 8-21-24.)
 
1269.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning
herein indicated.
   (a)    Sign- means any visual communication including letters, words,
designs, colors, symbols, images, pictures, emblems, drawings, illustrations,
banners, placards, flags, posters, fixtures or other similar item which is
affixed to or integrated into a building, structure or land, or otherwise
situated on a lot, and which is intended to identify, describe, direct or
attract attention to announce, or promote a product, place, activity, person,
idea, institution, entity or business.
   (b)    Wall Sign- means any sign attached to, painted on, or integrated into
the wall of any building and located in a plane parallel to the wall and
supported by the building. Wall signs shall also include signs on awning or
canopies.
   (c)    Free-standing Sign- means a sign that is supported from the ground by
means of a free-standing wall, monument, poles, or other structural support
system and not attached to any building
   (d)    Window Sign - means a sign, that is attached or affixed to, painted
on, or located within two (2) feet inside of a window or door of a building and
which is legible more than five (5) feet beyond the face of the window or door
on which such sign is located.
   (e)    Temporary Sign- means a sign constructed of cloth, paper, wood,
fabric, or other temporary material, with or without a structural frame, and
which is intended or designed for a limited period of display and removable
without special handling.
   (f)    Sign Structure- means the sign face(s) and walls, foundations, poles,
pillars, brackets, framing, and other materials supporting, adjacent to or
above the sign face(s).
   (g)    Changeable Copy Sign- means a sign designed to display multiple or
changing messages whether by manual, mechanical or electronic means. Such signs
are characterized by changeable letters, symbols or numerals that are not
permanently affixed to the structure, framing or background allowing the
letters, characters, or graphics to be modified from time to time manually or
by electronic or mechanical devices. Electronically changed signs may include
either electronic message boards or digital displays.
   (h)    Permanent Sign - means a sign permanently affixed or attached to the
ground or a structure and which cannot be removed without special handling,
such as removing or dismantling a foundation, fasteners, adhesives or similar
materials providing support or structural integrity for the sign.

pictures, colors, images, symbols, and emblems displayed as, on or by a sign.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 5-25-16; Ord. 2024-18. Passed 8-21-24.)
 
1269.03 MEASUREMENT DETERMINATIONS.
   The following shall be the basis for determining sign area, sign height, and
building or tenant frontage.
   (a)    Sign Area or Dimension. Sign area shall include the entire face of
the sign from edge to edge, including any sign structure, provided however that
a proportional base, framing or similar structure that is adjacent to the sign
face and does not display any message may be excluded by the Architectural
Review Board in calculating the sign area.
      (1)    For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregular shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than
three (3) adjacent regular geometric shapes that encompasses the perimeter of
all the elements in the display. Regular geometric shapes are squares,
rectangles, circles, ovals, triangles, and trapezoids.
      (2)    When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but
the elements are separated by open space, the area of the sign shall include
the space between the elements.
      (3)    For free-standing signs:
         A.   The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of
the faces when two (2) identical display faces are joined, are parallel or are
within 30 degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point separated
by a distance that exceeds two feet.
         B.    No more than two display faces shall be permitted.
         C.    The portion of a solid sign base, up to a maximum height of two
(2) feet, may be excluded from the calculated sign area provided such base is
adequately screened by landscaping as determined by the Architectural Review
Board.
      (4)    Air between a projecting sign and the wall to which it is
attached, and detached lighting fixtures and associated brackets shall not be
included in the calculation of sign area.
   (b)    Sign Height. The height of a free-standing sign shall be measured
from the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support structure to
the tallest element of the sign structure. A free-standing sign on a man-made
base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the average site
grade prior to any grade change in the area of a sign.
   (c)    Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of these sign
regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public street other
than a limited access highway or that contains a public entrance to the uses
therein shall be considered the building frontage.
      (1)    The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)    In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)    A building is considered to have two frontages whenever the lot
fronts on two or more streets, or the building has a public entrance on a wall
other than the wall that faces the street. The property owner shall determine
which wall shall be the primary building frontage and which wall shall be the
secondary building frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be
considered its primary frontage and only one additional wall considered its
secondary frontage.
      (4)    For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 5-25-16; Ord. 2024-18. Passed 8-21-24.)
 
1269.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    All signs shall be of substantial construction so as to withstand
weather conditions, such as rain, snow, wind, and freezing and thawing, without
deterioration of the sign or its structure. Cloth, paper, or any other
temporary materials shall not be permitted on permanent signs.
   (b)   No signs, except as herein provided, shall be permitted.
   (c)    No sign shall be audible or emit sounds of any type.
   (d)    No sign shall have flashing, moving, intermittent, blinking, or
changing lights or other illumination, or any moving parts.
   (e)   All signs, including temporary signs, shall at all times be maintained
in good condition and repair and be operated in accordance with this chapter.
Upon determination that a sign is not being maintained or is in poor condition
or repair or is not being operated in accordance with this chapter, the
Building Inspector or his or her designated agent may order such sign to be
brought into compliance or removed within a specified time period. Should the
property owner fail to bring the sign into compliance as directed, the Building
Inspector may institute injunction, mandamus, abatement, or any other
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove such
violation.
   (f)   Where illuminated signs are permitted, signs may be internally or
externally illuminated as follows:
      (1)   Signs may be internally illuminated with LED's or similar
technology inside or incorporated into the sign face provided that the sign
shall be factory set so that the luminance of the sign shall not exceed a
maximum of three foot candles measured ten feet from the sign's face at maximum
brightness. Internally illuminated signs shall be equipped with a device
activated by photocell, timer or other method that automatically reduces the
sign's light intensity when there is less natural ambient light.
      (2)   External illumination of signs is limited to a white (color
temperature between 3200 to 5600 Kelvin) stationary light directed solely at
the sign and shall be designed and shielded so as to prevent glare and minimize
light trespass onto adjacent properties and to prevent view of the light source
from any property other than that on which the sign is located. In no instance
shall the intensity of the light exceed twenty foot candles at any point on the
sign face.
      (3)   Signs may use back lighting or halo lighting where the
Architectural Board of Review approves the use of such techniques.
      (4)   Temporary signs shall not be illuminated.
      (5)   All illumination of free standing signs, whether internal,
external, or changeable copy, shall be turned off between the hours of 11:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
   (g)   Electronic changeable copy signs are prohibited.
   (h)   The following signs shall be exempt from these regulations:
      (1)   Any public purpose/safety sign and any other notice or warning
required by a valid and applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or
resolution.
      (2)   Any sign inside a building, including those attached or near
windows except as regulated in Section 1269.09(e).
      (3)   Signs which are not visible from off the premises.
   (i)   Any sign which was legally in existence prior to the effective date of
any provision of this chapter or any amendment to this chapter which prohibits
such sign, but which does not conform to this chapter shall be considered a
legally nonconforming sign provided such sign complies with all safety
regulations and is operated and maintained as required by this chapter. Normal
maintenance and repairs, repainting, and/or the replacement of tenant panels
and electronic component upgrades and replacements shall be permitted. Any
alteration to the size, structure, or location of a legally nonconforming sign,
the removal of such sign, or the loss or damage of more than fifty percent of
the value of such sign shall cause the sign to lose its legally nonconforming
status.
   (j)   Free-standing signs greater than twelve square feet in area shall be:
      (1)   Placed on a full continuous masonry wall or foundation of a full
continuous monument base; or,
      (2)   Have a full continuous enclosure between the bottom of the sign and
finished grade.
   (k)   All signs shall be erected entirely on private property with no part
of said sign extending over the public street or right-of-way.
   (l)   Temporary signs shall not be displayed for longer than either sixty
days or for the period during which the activity, event, or function to which
the sign refers is occurring, whichever time period is shorter.
   (m)   Buildings that are contiguous shall constitute a single building.
(Ord. 2015-34. Passed 5-25-16; Ord. 2024-18. Passed 8-21-24.)
1269.05 SIGNS PERMITTED IN U-1 SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICTS.
   (a)    One permanent free-standing sign not more than two (2) square feet in
area nor four ( 4) feet in height.
   (b)    Two permanent free-standing signs, neither of which shall be more
than one (1) square foot in area nor three (3) feet in height.
   (c)    One temporary free-standing sign not exceeding six (6) square feet in

   (e)    No sign permitted by this section shall be illuminated.
   (f)    No sign shall be erected closer than twenty (20) feet from the
pavement of a street or within six (6) feet of any property line. If, due to
the topography, existing foliage or other similar conditions existing as to a
particular property, conformance with the setback requirement herein would
impair the visibility of the sign, the Building Inspector may permit an
exception to the set-back requirement. (Ord. 2015-34. Passed 5-25-16.)
1269.06 SIGNS PERMITTED IN U-1A TOWNHOUSE DISTRICTS.

(Ord. 2017-14. Passed 8-16-17.)
1269.07 SIGNS PERMITTED IN U-2 PUBLIC BUILDING DISTRICTS.
   (a)    The total area of wall signs shall not be greater than one square
foot in area for each two lineal feet of building frontage.
   (b)   Each building shall be permitted one permanent free-standing sign not
to exceed twenty-four square feet in area nor six feet in height. Each

When reviewing the appropriateness of such deviation from the regulations
herein, the Planning Commission shall approve such sign only when it determines
that:
      (1)    The sign is of such size and scale to be appropriate for the size
of the building and the portion of the building (panel, fascia, wall, etc.) on
which the sign will be placed.
      (2)    The proposed sign is the minimum necessary to assure it is legible
to the intended viewers which are typically the passing motorists.
      (3)    The additional sign, the additional sign area, the alternative
location that is proposed, and/or the design of the proposed sign will not
adversely impact the adjacent residential areas or, otherwise, compromise any
other public interests.
 
   (e)    In advance of a specific sign application being submitted, an overall
sign plan may be submitted by a property owner to the Planning Commission. Such
overall sign plan shall be considered by the Planning Commission utilizing the
criteria in subsection (b) above. Once a sign plan has been approved for a
property, then individual signs for such property, whether new or replacement
signs, may be approved administratively when the Inspector of Buildings
determines that the proposed new or replacement sign and its installation is in
compliance with the approved overall plan and this Chapter.
 
   (f)   City Council shall establish fees for sign permits and may adjust such
fees from time to time as Council determines to be appropriate.

   (a)    Every building erected in a U-1 District shall have a side yard along
each lot line other than a street line or rear line. Each single-family
dwelling and each multiple-family dwelling shall be deemed a separate building
and shall have side yards as above prescribed. The least dimension of the side
yards in a U-1 District shall not be less than ten feet plus one-half the
height of the building. For the purpose of this measurement, the height of the
building shall be taken on the wall nearest the side line, measuring from the
natural grade to the highest point of the coping of the wall for flat roofs, to
the deck line for mansard roofs, and to the mean height between eaves and ridge
for gable, gambrel or hip roofs.
   (b)   Buildings and structures, including accessory structures and uses, in
U-2 Districts shall be setback from side lot lines such distance as shall be
approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site development plan
approval based upon their massing, scale, level and hours of activity, noise
and light generation, and similar factors, but in no case shall the side yard
setback be less than the height of the building or structure. The Planning
Commission may require buffering of adjacent properties as it deems necessary
to mitigate potential impacts from such factors. Buffers may include, but are
not limited to, strips of land, mounding, fencing, and vegetative screening as
determined by the Planning Commission.

U-2 District, no building, unless it is located fifty feet or more back from
the street line, shall stand within ten feet of such adjoining Class U-1 or U-
2 District.
   (e)   The side yards herein provided for shall be open for their full
required dimensions from the ground to the sky, unobstructed except for the
ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, cornices and other
ornamental features, to the extent of not over six inches, except that within
five feet of the street wall a cornice may project not over three feet into
such yard, provided that if the building is not more than two and one-half
stories in height, the cornice may project not over three and one-half feet
into such yard.
(Ord. 2020-25. Passed 12-23-20.)
1270.08 REAR YARDS.
   (a)    In a U-1 District, and on lots in U-4 Districts, the rear line of
which adjoins a U-1 or U-2 District or on which a multiple-family dwelling is
erected, every main and accessory building erected shall have a rear yard
extending the full width of the lot. The least dimension of such rear yard for
the main building shall be at least the sum of twenty percent of the depth of
the lot plus one-half the height of the building. The least dimension of such
rear yard for an accessory building shall be fifteen feet, except that the rear
yard setback for an accessory building that has a wall greater than twenty-five
feet in length facing an adjoining property, shall be increased by an
additional one foot for every three feet of accessory building wall length
greater than twenty-five feet. No accessory building shall be erected closer to
any street line than the main building.
   (b)   In a U-2 District buildings and structures, including accessory
structures, shall be setback from rear lot lines such distance as shall be
approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site development plan
approval based upon their massing, scale, level and hours of activity, noise
and light generation, and similar factors, but in no case shall such rear
setback be less than the height of the building or structure. The Planning
Commission may require buffering of adjacent properties as it deems necessary
to mitigate potential impacts from such factors. Buffers may include, but are
not limited to, strips of land, mounding, fencing, and vegetative screening as
determined by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   In a U-3 District, every building erected shall have a rear yard
extending the full width of the lot. The least dimension of such rear yard
shall be at least twenty percent of the depth of the lot and at least one-half
the height of the building.
   (d)   The rear yards herein provided for shall be open for their full
required dimensions from the ground, or other level permitted by this section,
to the sky unobstructed, except for the ordinary projections of window sills,
belt courses, cornices and other ornamental fixtures, or eaves, not more than
two feet wide.
(Ord. 2020-25. Passed 12-23-20.)
1270.09 REQUIRED HOUSE SIZES.

1444.01 PERMITS TO BE APPLIED FOR AND OBTAINED; GUARANTEES; EXCAVATIONS;
DRIVEWAYS.
     (a)    Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building or other structure, a permit shall first be
obtained by the owner or his or her agent from the Inspector of Buildings. The
application shall be made in writing and upon printed forms furnished by the
Inspector. It shall, except for removals, be accompanied by a complete set of
specifications and by a complete set of plans and working drawings made to a
scale of not less than one-quarter of an inch to the foot, and on paper or
cloth, in ink or by a process which will not fade or be obliterated. When the
plans, drawings and specifications are found to conform to the requirements of
this chapter, the Inspector shall issue a permit and affix to the plans,
drawings and specifications an official stamp of approval. The plans, drawings
and specifications shall then be returned to the applicant. One copy thereof
shall be filed with the Inspector before commencing the construction and shall
remain on file until the completion of such building or structure, when the
same will be returned to the owner or his or her agent if request for such
return is made in writing at the time the copy is filed with the Inspector. If
no such request for return of plans and specifications is made, the Inspector
may destroy them after the completion of the work. One copy of the plans,
drawings and specifications having the stamp of the Inspector is to be kept at
the site of the work until such work is completed.
   (b)    Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building or other structure, if it is desired or may
be necessary to drive across the curb, tree lawn or sidewalk during the
construction, the owner shall construct and maintain a driveway, according to
the provisions of subsection (d) hereof, across and over such curb, tree lawn
or sidewalk, so that the same shall not be injured or damaged.
   (c)    Before opening or excavating in any public street or road in the
City, a permit shall first be obtained from the Inspector by the person, firm
or corporation desiring to open the street. At the time of securing such
permit, the applicant shall deposit with the Inspector the sum of three hundred
dollars ($300.00). All resurfacing of openings in streets authorized by this
chapter shall be done by the proper officers and employees of the City, and the
cost of such resurfacing shall be charged to the applicant for the permit under
which the openings were made. Such part of the deposit of three hundred dollars
($300.00) as may remain after deducting the cost of resurfacing shall be
returned to the applicant upon the completion of resurfacing to the approval of
the Service Director. If the cost of such resurfacing is more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00), such excess shall be collected from the applicant.
Applicants for and persons doing work under permits authorized by this
subsection shall replace the earth removed in such work and shall puddle or
tamp such earth to the satisfaction of the Service Director. Such persons shall
maintain such guards and warning devices or lights around such work as may be
provided by ordinance or directed by the Service Director. No person shall be
allowed in any way to obstruct any street or railroad track or tracks by
excavation between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon.
   (d)    No work in connection with the construction of any new dwelling,
building or other structure under any permit which has been obtained pursuant
to this chapter shall be undertaken or commenced unless a driveway of at least
nine feet in width has been constructed from the street pavement to the
building site of slag, stone or other material satisfactory to the Inspector in
order to provide a base and bearing sufficient to support material trucks and
other vehicles necessary in the construction of such dwelling, building or
other structure and to prevent dirt, mud and other debris from being dropped,
spread or scattered on the public streets. Where such driveways must be
constructed over or across any street drainage ditch which is adjacent to the
pavement of the street, a culvert shall be constructed in such ditch, in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1020 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code, in order that the flow
of water therein will not be obstructed and the usefulness of the drainage
ditch will not be impaired. Before proceeding with any such work, the sum of
six hundred dollars ($600.00) shall be deposited with the Inspector, as a
guarantee that the street, pavement, tree lawn, curb, sidewalk or ditch will
not be damaged or injured in any way whatsoever. At the completion of the
construction of any such dwelling, building or other structure, such sum of six
hundred dollars ($600.00) shall be returned, provided that no damage or injury
to the street, or to the pavement, tree lawn, curb, sidewalk, drainage ditch,
sewer or drain therein, has been caused or allowed to remain. It shall be a
further condition of the return of the deposit of six hundred dollars ($600.00)
that the following requirements with respect to open drainage ditches, sewers
or drains located in the street abutting the premises on which such building,
dwelling or other structure is located shall be met:
      (1)    Any open ditch shown and described on the original plans and
specifications for the improvement of the street by grading, draining, curbing
and paving the same, shall be replaced and constructed to conform with such
plans and specifications.
      (2)    The flow line of any such open ditch shall in no case be less than
fifteen inches below the elevation of the edge of the road and the outlet
lowered to insure drainage.
      (3)    The construction or restoration of all such open ditches shall be
completed immediately and prior to the construction of any building, dwelling
or other structure on the premises and such ditches shall be kept open at all
times.
      (4)    Grass seed shall be sown immediately in the open ditches and
adjacent tree lawns in order to prevent erosion.
   If any damage or injury to the street, or to the pavement, tree lawn, curb,
drainage ditch, sewer or drain therein, has been caused, exists or has been
allowed to remain in connection with the improvement of the premises abutting
on the street where the building, dwelling or other structure is located, or if
the open ditches have not been restored or constructed as required above after
notice from the Inspector, the City may cause such work to be done and the
amount deducted from the sum of six hundred dollars ($600.00) so deposited and
the balance returned. The Inspector shall be authorized to stop all
construction under any permit which has been obtained pursuant to this chapter
if the provisions of this subsection are not complied with.
   (e)    Before proceeding with the installation or repair of a water line
requiring connection on the opposite side of the street, a permit shall first
be obtained by the owner or his or her agent from the Inspector of Buildings
and a deposit of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) made with the
Inspector, as a guarantee that the improvements, including any sod in the right
of way, will be restored to their former condition satisfactorily to the
Inspector of Buildings upon inspection. If there is any damage or injury to the
improvements in the right of way which have not been properly restored after
notice from the Inspector, the City may cause such work to be done and the
amount deducted from the sum of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) so
deposited and the balance returned. Where, in the judgment of the Inspector,
sowing grass seed would not be satisfactory to restore the ground to its prior
condition, he or she may require that it be resodded.
1444.02 PERMITS TO ERECT PART OF BUILDING.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the Inspector of
Buildings from issuing a permit for the erection of any part of a building or
structure, where plans and detailed statements have been presented for the same
before the entire plans and detailed statements of the building or structure
have been submitted, provided that a complete set of all such plans and
specifications as prescribed in Section
1444.01 shall be placed on file before the foundation wall is brought to grade,
or to a height to receive the first tier of beams, girder or joists. If any
owner permits his or her agent to put in foundations or work provided for in
this section which may not be in keeping with the final plans and which may be
contrary to the requirements of this Building Code, the Inspector will not be
bound by the work already done from incomplete drawings, and the owner shall
proceed with such work as is authorized by this section entirely at his or her
own risk.
(Ord. 1929-54. Passed 7-10-29.)
1444.03 PERMITS FOR SUPERSTRUCTURE.
   No permit shall be issued for the erection of the superstructure of any
building above the foundation or basement wall until all approved plans,
specifications and details required by the provisions of this chapter are
placed on file with the Inspector of Buildings.
(Ord. 1929-54. Passed 7-10-29.)

sewerage and water supply.

1444.05 PERMITS NOT REQUIRED.
   No permit shall be required for minor interior repairs or for alterations to
or in buildings which do not involve any change in their supporting walls,
members or structural parts, or in their stairways, elevators, fire escapes or
other means of communication, ingress or egress, or light and ventilation.
(Ord. 1929-54. Passed 7-10-29.)
1444.06 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF PERMITS.
   (a)    If, after a permit has been issued, the operation called for by it is
not commenced within six months of the date thereof, such permit shall be void,
and before such operation can commence, a new permit shall be taken out by the
owner or by his or her agent or architect and fees as hereafter fixed for the
original permit in Section
1446.01 shall be paid therefor.
   (b)    On each permit, the Building Inspector shall establish a time period
within which the construction, including final grading and landscaping,
pursuant to said permit, must be completed, which time period shall be no
longer than one year after the issuance of the permit for construction, nine
months for landscaping and nine months for additions or remodeling. No owner or
contractor shall fail to comply with the established time period for completion
of construction.
(Ord. 1997-43. Passed 12-17-97.)
1444.07 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   When the work for which any building permit was issued is not being
performed in conformity with the detailed statement, plans or specifications
upon which such permit was issued, it shall be the duty of the Inspector of
Buildings to notify the owner or owners or his, her or their agent, in writing,
by posting a notice on the building for which the permit is issued, which
notice shall state that the work is being constructed in violation of the
permit and that such work must be suspended until a permit for such deviation
from the detailed statement, plans or specifications is obtained, or that such
work shall be made to conform to the detailed statement, plans or
specifications upon which a permit therefor was issued. If the owner or owners,
or his, her or their agent, fails to comply with the notice on the posting
thereof, it shall be the further duty of the Inspector to revoke the permit.
Written notice of such revocation, signed by the Inspector, shall be
immediately served upon the owner, agent, superintendent or contractor in
charge of the work, or shall be posted on such premises, and no person shall
perform any work in or about the structure, building or premises after the

property across the street from the property upon which the project will be
constructed. All such meetings shall be held in the City Hall, except that the

   (a)    No building permit shall be issued for a project which erects,

which materially affects the exterior appearance, design, or size of the
building or other structure unless the Board has granted final approval.

or otherwise alter a building in a fashion which is in any way inconsistent

1450.08 PROCEDURES: REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF DESIGN; ENDORSEMENT OF PLANS; APPEAL
   (a)    Preliminary Review; Suggestions; Preliminary Approval.
      (1)    Any person who seeks to construct or alter a structure within the
City which materially changes the exterior appearance or size of said structure
may obtain a preliminary review of the proposed design before an application
for final approval is presented for review. The recommendations of the
Architectural Board of Review are intended to assure that high quality of
exterior design excellence and landscape harmony are preserved in the city.
      (2)    The preliminary review may be made of conceptual sketches and
sketch plans which convey the general nature of the architectural floor plans;
the site plan indicating the topography, existing tree cover, and related
access roadways; the context and/or visual relationship to adjacent residences
and properties; and the visual massing and appearance of all sides of the
proposed structure. A new house may be designed in any style, but its exterior
size, shape, materials, color and texture should be compatible with existing
houses and it should fit into its site and its scenic surroundings so as to be
complementary and unobtrusive.
      (3)    All applicants proposing new construction or alterations to
existing buildings are strongly encouraged to present their conceptual designs
as early as possible and prior to making major design commitments to their
architect or contractor, so that the Architectural Board of Review may offer
timely and appropriate guidance to such applicants.
      (4)    The Board may make suggestions regarding the proposed design, and
indicate any problems the applicant is likely to encounter if final plans are
presented in conformance with the preliminary plans.
      (5)    The Board shall grant preliminary approval if the Board determines
that the proposed design presented in the preliminary plans is sufficient to
warrant final plans. If the Board does not grant preliminary approval, it shall
advise the applicant of the reasons preliminary approval was not granted.
 
   (b)    Preliminary Approval.  Preliminary approval shall be marked upon the
conceptual drawings of the residence or other structure(s). Preliminary
approval shall be evidence that the concepts presented are acceptable to the
Architectural Board of Review, and the project should proceed to final
drawings.
 
   (c)    Final Review. Each application for final approval by the
Architectural Board of Review shall have scale drawings including:
      (1)   A site plan showing the proposed building location, property
boundary lines, topography and any prominent ground or site features;
      (2)   Floor plans;
      (3)   Building elevations;
      (4)   Transverse and longitudinal sections; and written specifications,
that, taken together, provide a detailed description of the site placement,
size, volume and appearance of the proposed building; and
      (5)   A plan of any landscape features to be installed as a part of the
proposed project.
 
   (d)    Approval; Disapproval. If the Architectural Board of Review finds,
upon final review, that the plot plan and exterior design and accompanying
documents conform to the requirements of the standards and criteria set forth
in this chapter, it may approve the application. If such design and documents
do not conform, it may conditionally approve them by specifying modifications,
which would make the same acceptable. If the Board finds the exterior design
for a building or structure would produce harmful effects within the City, or
otherwise not comply with the standards and criteria of this chapter, the Board
shall disapprove the application, design and accompanying documents. In the
event the Board fails to act upon the plans within one hundred twenty (120)
days of the filing date of the application, the application will be deemed to
be approved.
 
   (e)    Final Approval. Final approval or disapproval of the plot plan and of
the exterior design and accompanying documents shall be endorsed thereon by the
Board by its Chairman, or by the Building Inspector in the event of action by
the Planning Commission, as described in Section
 1450.06(f). In the event the Board or Commission issues conditional approval,
the conditions shall be noted in writing upon the appropriate plans to which
the conditions apply. The Building Inspector shall not issue any building
permit for any application, which has not received final approval, nor shall
any building permit be issued for any application which has granted conditional
approval, unless and until the conditions noted on the plans have been
satisfied.
 
   (f)    Appeal to Planning Commission.
      (1)    If the Board disapproves any application or makes any
determination adverse to the applicant, the applicant shall have twenty (20)
days after the meeting at which the announcement of the decision is made to
file a notice of appeal to the Planning Commission of the adverse decision.
Such notice shall be filed with the Building Inspector.
      (2)    The Planning Commission shall place the matter for hearing on the
agenda for the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission following the
filing of the notice of appeal, provided that the notice of appeal is filed at
least fourteen (14) days prior to the next Planning Commission meeting;
otherwise the Planning Commission shall place the appeal on the agenda of the
subsequent regular meeting.
      (3)    The Planning Commission shall decide the appeal within ninety (90)
days of the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the applicant requests
additional time for decision. A failure by the Planning Commission to decide
the matter within ninety (90) days of the notice of appeal shall be deemed to
be an affirmance of the decision of the Board. The decision of the Planning
Commission shall be final within the City. In the event the Planning Commission
reverses or modifies the decision of the Board, the Building Inspector shall
endorse the approval or modification, ordered by the Planning Commission, and
issue the appropriate building permits.
         (Ord. 2014-31. Passed 6-17-15.)
 
1450.09 EVALUATION STANDARDS.
   (a)    Excessive Dissimilarity. The exterior design and size of a building
or structure, its orientation on the site, and its landscape treatment shall
not be excessively dissimilar to any other existing building, structure, site
plan or landscape plan in the neighborhood. For the purposes of this section, a
building, structure, site plan or landscape plan shall be deemed to be
"existing" if a valid permit has been issued for its construction.
 
   (b)    Excessive Similarity. The exterior design and size of a building or
structure shall not be excessively similar in relation to any other building or
structure, existing or for which a permit has been issued, on a lot located
such that the buildings may be viewed simultaneously, particularly any of the
following features of exterior design:
      (1)    Facade. An elevation shall not be apparently identical, including
the size and arrangement of either doors, windows, porches, or other openings
or breaks in the facade, nor shall there be a directly reverse arrangement;
      (2)    Other significant features.  Architectural features, including but
not limited to materials, colors, roofline, or other design elements shall not
be apparently identical.
 
   (c)    Inappropriate Design. If, based upon evidence in the record, the
Board determines that a building, structure, addition, site plan or landscape
plan is inconsistent with the predominant architectural style of the residence,
or residences in the neighborhood, or is otherwise inconsistent with other
elements of the design of the building, structure, site plan or landscape plan,
the Board may make a finding that the design is inappropriate.
 
   (d)    Harmful Effects of Design. In order to make a valid determination of
excessively similar, dissimilar or inappropriate design, the Board must also
issue a finding or findings, based upon the evidence in the record, that such
similarity, dissimilarity or inappropriateness will produce one or more harmful
effects on one or more properties in the neighborhood and identify what the
potential harmful effect( s) will be.
(Ord. 2014-31. Passed 6-17-15.)
 
1450.10 EVALUATION CRITERIA.
   The following criteria are established to guide the Architectural Review
Board in its review of proposals and in applying the evaluation standards set
forth in Section
1450.08:
   Materials shall be appropriate for the use of the building, and for their
relationship to other materials, including those used on adjacent buildings.
   The design of any building shall be judged in reference to its site and the
character of its surroundings, not as an independent object.
   The gross floor area for a residence shall be in character with the
surrounding neighborhood and not be excessively large relative to the site or
in comparison to adjacent residences;
   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of the
building, and for their relationship to the site and adjacent buildings. Colors
shall be harmonious and shall use only compatible accents.
   Architectural details and ornaments shall be meaningful to the overall
design and appropriate for the size and scale of the building.
   Buildings should be sited to minimize grade changes and to take advantage of
natural features, including mature trees. Buildings shall be set at proper
grades and otherwise in proper relation to the proposed surroundings.
   Mechanical equipment shall be considered as it affects rooftop appearance,
sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke and other nuisance aspects.
   Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be considered as they affect the
appearance from the street and from the site as well. The relationship of
paving to the building shall be appropriate considered factors such as safety,
drainage and landscaping.
   Landscaping shall be appropriate for the size and use of the area, and for
its relationship to the building, street, parking areas, walks and adjacent
buildings.
   Lighting shall be considered for the appropriateness of nighttime
illumination of the grounds, drives, walks, parking areas and the building, and
its effect upon surrounding areas.
   Signs shall be considered for the appropriateness of size, scale, shape,
color and illumination in relation to the building site and neighboring sites.
(Ord. 2014-31. Passed 6-17-15.)
 
1450.11 SPECIFIC DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The City has certain existing standards with which new construction should
comply, when feasible, so as to not adversely impact the value of existing
properties. These standards include:
   (a)    Basement ventilator-type windows shall be kept below grade. They
shall be set in window wells or other similar devices;
   (b)    Roofs shall be constructed of high quality materials, and the look of
a dimensional shingle is preferred for asphalt shingle roofs;
   (c)    Fireplace chimneys and furnace flues shall be clad with brick or
stone;
   (d)    Flue pipes and utility services shall, to the extent possible, be
blocked from the views of neighbors and from public rights of way by
architectural features and/or appropriate landscaping.
      (Ord. 2014-31. Passed 6-17-15.)
 
1450.12 PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
   In addition to the duties of the Architectural Board of Review established
in other provisions of Chapter
1450, the Mayor may request from time to time one or more of the Architect
Advisors of the Architectural Board of Review to perform, at the discretion of
the Mayor, architectural consulting services in relation to the construction
and/or renovation of public buildings. The compensation for consulting services

1462.01 PERMIT; BOND; DEPOSIT; MINOR WORK.
   (a)    Inasmuch as the removal of topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam,
sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from land results
in noise and the creation of large quantities of dust, which prove to be
obnoxious to inhabitants in the vicinity thereof; creates erosion and drainage
problems, swamps and lakes, frequently results in damage to adjoining
properties by disturbing the substructure thereof, tends to have a disrupting
effect on ground water supplies, and creates other similar dangers to public
health and safety; results in unsightly and blighted areas unfit for other and
useful purposes, thus retarding or preventing the development of desirable
residential, commercial and industrial areas, depressing property and other
values in the neighborhood and permanently destroying the land, leaving it
almost valueless for any purpose; creates highway hazards due to the presence
of heavy trucks and other equipment on the roads, and due to the scattering of
earth and debris thereon; and, unless properly planned, regulated and
supervised, has an adverse effect upon the public peace, health, safety and
general welfare; therefore, any person, firm, corporation or other entity
wishing to change the contours of land by grading, excavating or filling, or
desiring to remove topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand, gravel,
rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from land located in any area or
place within the City, shall first, prior to commencing or continuing any such
operation, file with the Inspector of Buildings a written application for
permission to carry on such operations, which application shall contain the
following information:
      (1)    The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of
the owner of the land if it is different from that of the name and address of
the applicant.
      (2)    The description of the land, with boundaries, upon which such
operations are proposed to take place. A map of the land, showing its location
and dimensions and indicating on what part or parts thereof it is desired to
conduct grading, excavating, filling or removal operations, shall accompany the
application.
      (3)    The method of operation to be employed; the time within which such
work is to be commenced and completed; the existing and proposed topography of
the land and its ultimate proposed use; and the type and nature of refilling,
reseeding or replanting proposed. Such application shall also contain a
statement that the applicant and the owner of the land shall furnish a cash
performance bond in a sum not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
residential lot included in the permit, if granted, for changing the contours
of the land by grading, excavating or filling, or for the removal of topsoil or
loam, or for other removals in accordance with these Codified Ordinances.
      (4)    The name and address of any person, firm, corporation or other
entity who or which, it is contemplated, will do the actual work of grading,
excavating, filling or removal. If an agreement, contract, lease or other
arrangement for such work is in writing, a copy thereof must be attached to the
application; if such is not in writing, the information must be included in the
application.
      (5)    Where deemed appropriate by the Inspector of Buildings, any or all
of the following additional information:
         A.    The areas of the described premises that will be exposed at any
one time;
         B.    The type of permanent and final vegetation and structures that
will be planted and installed on the described premises and the time within
which such vegetation and structures are to be planted and installed; and
         C.    A description of the type of soil comprising the described
premises.
   (b)    The Engineer may request a report from the Cuyahoga Soil and Water
Conservation District, stating its recommendations for adequate erosion and
sediment control measures for the proposed grading, excavating, filling or
removal operation. After securing all such information as it deems necessary,
the Planning Commission shall set the matter down for a public hearing and mail
notice thereof to the applicant and owner of the land at the addresses given in
the application not less than three days prior to the public hearing, excluding
the day of the mailing and including the day of the public hearing. If, after
such hearing, the Inspector of Buildings determines that the granting of the
application will not adversely affect the public welfare, peace, health, safety
and convenience, he or she shall grant the application with such conditions
relating to the method of grading, excavating, filling or removal of the land
or area on which the operations are to be conducted, the terms of the permit,
the amount of topsoil or loam to be respread on the land, the amount of the
removal which may be permitted on the land, the refilling, reseeding or
replanting of the land, the drainage after removal and such other conditions
which the Inspector may deem necessary for the protection of the public health,
safety, peace, convenience and welfare, which conditions shall be made a part
of the permit and constitute limitations thereon.
   (c)    In the event the application is denied, notice thereof shall be
mailed forthwith to the applicant and the owner of the land at the addresses
given in the application.
   (d)    If the Inspector of Buildings denies the application, the applicant
or owner may appeal to Council by filing a written notice of such appeal with
the Clerk within thirty days from the date of the mailing of the communication
sent by the Inspector to the applicant and owner, as provided in subsection (c)
hereof. The Clerk shall then obtain from the Inspector the application,
reports, recommendations, documents and minutes, or copies thereof, relating to
the application and the action taken thereon by the Inspector and submit the
same to Council. Council, by majority vote, may act to move upon the
application, subject to the limitations and provisions applicable to the
Planning Commission.
   (e)    If the application is granted, either by the Inspector of Buildings
or by Council, the Inspector shall issue a permit containing the restrictions
imposed, if any, upon the posting of a cash bond, running in favor of the City
and conditioned upon performance in accordance with the terms of the permit, in
an amount fixed by the approving body.
   (f)    The provisions of this section shall not be deemed or construed to
apply to any excavation or removal for a basement or foundation for any
proposed building for which a building permit has been issued and is in force
and effect. However, if such building is not commenced and carried forward, any
excavation or removal made preparatory thereto for a basement or foundation
shall be filled up and replanted.
   (g)    At the time of submission of the written application, the applicant
shall deposit with the Treasurer an amount of money as determined by the
Inspector of Buildings, but not less than four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00),
to cover the cost and expense of such investigation as may be necessary to
fully review such application and any accompanying maps, and to report upon the
same to the Inspector. The cost and expense of such investigation shall be
deducted from such deposit. If such expenditure exceeds the deposit, the excess
shall be paid into the Treasury by the applicant upon request of the Clerk. If
such deposit exceeds the expenditure, the balance shall be refunded to the
applicant.
   If the application is granted, the applicant shall reimburse the Treasurer
for any expenses incurred in connection with City supervision or inspection of
the operations as outlined in the permit. Statements for expenses shall be
submitted to the permit holder by the Clerk and shall be subject to payment
within thirty days of receipt. Failure to pay such statements shall constitute
grounds for the revocation of the permit.
   (h)    All applications for grading and filling which are determined by the
Inspector to be so minor, desirable and without potential harm to adjacent
landowners and the public health, safety and general welfare, shall be
permitted by him or her, in writing, subject to such conditions as he or she
may require in the public interest. The permittee shall notify the Inspector of
the completion of the work, which shall then be inspected by the Inspector. The
fee for the permit and the inspection shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00). Such
applications need only contain so much information as the Inspector may
require, and no bond shall be required. However, the penalty provisions of
Section
1462.99 shall apply to any violation of any such permit that the Inspector
issues.
(Ord. 1973-81. Passed 12-19-73.)
1462.02 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall change the contours of land, or assist in doing the same, by
grading, excavating or filling, or by removing topsoil, trees and other
vegetation, loam, sand, gravel, rock, stone, clay or other similar substances
from land, without first obtaining a permit as required herein, or in violation
of the terms of any permit granted as provided herein. A separate offense shall
be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues
after notification thereof.

1472.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Pepper Pike has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-
15-10.)
 
1472.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety

1472.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)
 
1472.04 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Pepper Pike as identified in Section
1472.05, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City
of Pepper Pike. (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)
 
1472.05 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps
are adopted:

(Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)
 
1472.10 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s

equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:     Special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Pepper Pike
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 17, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Pepper Pike flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1472.05 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1472.12(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1472.11(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1472.11(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Pepper Pike, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Pepper Pike have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Pepper Pike Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Pepper
Pike boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City
of Pepper Pike suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Pepper Pike has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
 
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1472.13, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
 
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1472.11(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;

actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1472.12(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Pepper Pike specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1472.11(j)(1)A.3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)
 
1472.13 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Pepper Pike Planning Commission is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 28000 Shaker Boulevard, Pepper Pike, Ohio.
 
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1472.13(d) of these regulations.
 
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
 
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Pepper Pike.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1472.13(d)(2)A. to K., have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Procedure at Hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
      (6)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         (Ord. 2010-44. Passed 9-15-10.)

1488.05 REVOCATION OF LICENSE TO OPERATE; APPEALS.
   Any license to operate a swimming pool, granted by the Inspector of
Buildings, may be revoked by him or her for failure to comply with any of the
provisions of this chapter or whenever, in the determination of the Inspector,
further operation under such license creates a menace to the safety or health
of the users of the swimming pool. The holder of any license which has been
revoked may appeal from such revocation in writing within thirty days thereof
to Council and Council shall, at its next regular meeting, determine the
legality and the reasonableness of the revocation of the license. No appeal
under this section, however, shall entitle the license holder to continue
operation of the swimming pool pending action by Council.

1492.01 PURPOSE AND EFFECT.
   This chapter, governing wireless telecommunication facilities, is
established to provide for the construction, erection, maintenance, extension
and removal of such facilities only when such facilities are either
specifically permitted in the zoning district in which they are to be located
or by permission of the City Planning Commission through the granting of a
variance or other special permit as may be authorized by the Zoning Code. The
purpose of this chapter is to balance the competing interests created by the
Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) and the interests
of the City in regulating wireless telecommunication towers and related
facilities for the following reasons:
   (a)    To provide for orderly development within the City,
   (b)    To protect property values;
   (c)    To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the City, including its
residential character and unobstructed open spaces;
   (d)    To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the residents of the City.
   (e)    To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and the
nonintensive commercial zoning districts which are characteristic of the City
from the adverse effects of towers and related facilities; and
   (f)    To promote collocation of wireless telecommunication facilities in
order to decrease the total number of towers and related facilities in the
City.

1510.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Pepper Pike:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners/applicants who develop or re-develop
their property within the City of Pepper Pike to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Pepper Pike's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; clearing; grading; and all other uses that are
not specifically exempted in Section
1510.01 .
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
City of Pepper Pike shall comply with this regulation for linear projects
within public rights-of-way (e.g. roadway and sidewalk projects).
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize the
number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear construction
projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter 1520  Erosion and Sediment Control.

person (e.g., P.E., CESSWI, CPESC), as approved by the City Engineer, for
annual stormwater inspections.
         B.   The Stormwater Inspector shall use the SCM inspection form
available from the City Engineer.
         C.   It is deemed a violation of this section if the City does not
receive the annual inspection report before August 1 of each year. In such an
event, the City has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct any
inspections as necessary to verify that the SCMs are being operated and
maintained in accordance with this chapter and charge the responsible party
accordingly. Any accounts that are over thirty days delinquent may be certified
to the County Auditor, who shall then place the same on the tax duplicate of
the county, with interest as allowed by law, to be collected as taxes are
collected.

the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the landowner(s)
or organization responsible for maintenance does not make the required
corrections in the specified time period. In addition to any other penalty
provided for in this chapter, the City shall be reimbursed by the landowner(s)
or organization responsible for maintenance for all expenses incurred within
ten days of receipt of invoice from the City.
      (12)   Inspection and maintenance plan: This plan will meet the
requirements of the Construction General Permit and will be developed by the
owner/applicant and reviewed by the City Engineer. Maintenance requirements of
each SCM during and after construction should be included. Once the inspection
and maintenance plan is approved, a recorded copy of the plan must be provided
to the property owner or association that will be responsible for the long term
operation and maintenance of the BMP and submitted to the City Engineer as part
of the final inspections. The plan will also include the following:

incorporated. The maintenance plan will include a detailed drawing of each SCM
and outlet structures with the parts of the outlet structure labeled. This
schedule may include additional standards, as required by the City of Pepper
Pike Engineer, to ensure continued performance of SCMs permitted to be located
in, or within 50 feet of, water resources. The location and documentation of
all access and maintenance easements on the property. Alteration or termination
of these stipulations is prohibited.
      (13)   Required calculations: The owner/applicant shall submit
calculations for projected stormwater runoff flows, volumes, and timing into

completed for both pre- and post-development land use conditions and shall
include the underlying assumptions and hydrologic and hydraulic methods and
parameters used for these calculations. The owner/applicant shall also include
critical storm determination and demonstrate that the runoff from offsite areas
have been considered in the calculations. For each SCM, identify the drainage
area and size in acres, percent impervious cover within the drainage area,
volumetric runoff coefficient, peak discharge, and the time of concentration
for each subwatershed. Pervious and impervious areas should be treated as
separate subwatersheds unless allowed at the discretion of the City Engineer.

(Ord. 2024-37. Passed 10-23-24.)
 
1510.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)    General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and comply with Chapter
1540 Riparian Setbacks.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels. SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and
additional criteria required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this
regulation.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual or another design
manual acceptable for use by the City of Pepper Pike and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   SCMs designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve the
stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with the
proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Section
1240.07(b)(11), shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls
for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for
lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year,
24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development
runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the owner/
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1510.07  of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1520  and Chapter
1540 , all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the owner/applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and
alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a
safe design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1510.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
1510.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Pepper Pike,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Pepper Pike. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining un concentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream's physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a the wetland in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod,
and wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. If the owner/applicant proposes to discharge to natural
wetlands, a hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the
proposed discharge matches the predevelopment hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
 
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the owner/
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1510.07  of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Section
1520  and Section
1540 , all as determined by the City Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the owner's/applicant’s development site shall be
conveyed through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development
site at its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows
shall be diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is
not possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat
the off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be
approved until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that
off-site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. Flow shall be
directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs from areas too long
and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with landscaped
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open Drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City of Pepper Pike zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer.
The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when
necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Pepper Pike:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict the rise
in headwater elevation upstream of the culvert to on more than one (1) foot
during the 100-yr 24-hr storm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Pepper Pike
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City of Pepper Pike, reductions in
volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of
the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCM’s that meet the criteria in the Construction General
Permit.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Use the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States,
NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3) for rainfall depth data for stormwater design.
            6.   Temporal distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use. Curve numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1 and 9-5.
            8.   Time of concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 feet.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual or a
hydrologic model acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems.
         C.   From the volume determined in Section 1510.09(d)(3)A., determine
the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the
percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table 1.
Table 1: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas: SCM's on
previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the Construction General
Permit.
(Ord. 2024-37. Passed 10-23-24.)
 
1510.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the City of Pepper Pike determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The City
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed.
(Ord. 2024-37. Passed 10-23-24.)
 
1510.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Pepper Pike prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga Auditor and on
all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an additional 25-foot
wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; the planting of trees, shrubbery, or other woody growth
within the easement; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City of Pepper Pike. Any
re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be
removed by the City of Pepper Pike at the property owners' expense. Grading
and/or obstructions that is/are removed may not be returned to original
condition or configurations if determined by the City to be an obstruction to
the operation and maintenance of the stormwater facility.
(Ord. 2024-37. Passed 10-23-24.)
 
1510.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the owner and provided to the City
Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the City Engineer and per the
approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan approved
by the City Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the City Engineer may
require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if he/she determines
that the design was altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the location,
dimensions, and bearing of such SCMs and include the entity responsible for
long-term maintenance as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance Plan
and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement as specified in Section
1510.08  must be provided to the City Engineer.

(Ord. 2024-40. Passed 12-18-24.)
 
1520.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
stage of construction operation and the owner/applicant must implement such
controls. BMP selection and design must meet the criteria established within
the current Construction General Permit. BMP's must be designed, constructed,
and installed to meet the specifications in the Rainwater and Land Development
Manual or another design manual acceptable to the City of Pepper Pike. The
approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented, and maintained
according to the requirements in the Construction General Permit. Site
operators must conduct site inspections as described in the Construction
General Permit.
   (a)   MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All SCMs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The owner/applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
      When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation
of erosion and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures shall be
followed:
      (1)   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by the City
Engineer or his/her designated inspector.
      (3)   When SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the SCM must be implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the
inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned SCM is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the SCM is
not needed.
   (b)   FINAL STABLIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
owner/applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.
   (c)   DISPOSITION OF TEMPORARY PRACTICES. All temporary and permanent
erosion and sediment control practices shall be disposed of within thirty days
after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are
no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the City Engineering
Department. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized or removed to
prevent further erosion.
(Ord. 2024-40. Passed 12-18-24.)

      (8)   Areas requiring temporary and/or permanent stabilization
   (d)   The Abbreviated SWP3 at a minimum shall incorporate the following SCMs
as site conditions warrant. The City of Pepper Pike may require other SCMs as
site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development Manual.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw or hay
bales around an inlet are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Pepper Pike shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in the Construction
General Permit.
      (7)   Temporary sediment traps. Where site conditions exceed the
capabilities of silt fence, sediment traps shall be implemented as the primary
means of sediment control along the perimeter of disturbed areas. Temporary
diversions shall be used as necessary to route sediment-laden runoff to the
trap.
      (8)   Temporary Mulching. Due to its ease of implementation, relatively
low-cost, and high-effectiveness at abating erosion, periodic applications of
straw mulch or equivalent materials, should be planned for on every site.
      (9)   Rock check dams. Check dams shall be utilized in areas of
concentrated flow during active construction periods so as to minimize scouring
of the bottom of swales and ditches.
      (10)   Erosion control matting. Matting shall be used in areas of
concentrated flow (e.g. ditches, side and rear yard swales, etc.) where flow
will exceed 3.5 fps for a 10-year, 24-hour storm. It shall only be utilized at
the time of final stabilization.
      (11)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When SCMs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (12)   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization shall be determined by
the City Engineer.

   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges.  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Pepper Pike to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Pepper Pike as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging
treated sewage effluent in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29-02
(6) until such time as the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES
permitting mechanism for residential 1, 2, or 3 family dwellings. These
discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public
health nuisance by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
In compliance with the City of Pepper Pike Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit
coverage is available, discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage
treatment systems will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
 
   (b)    Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.

1540.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the City of Pepper Pike contributes to the health,
safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City of Pepper Pike. The
specific purpose and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses and
developments within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian
areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the City of Pepper Pike by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and
threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic
beauty and environment of the City of Pepper Pike, and thereby preserving the
character of the City of Pepper Pike, the quality of life of the residents of
the City of Pepper Pike, and corresponding property values.
 
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect and enhance these
functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing

   (a)   The Planning Commission may grant a variance to this regulation as
provided herein in conformance with the procedures set forth in Section
1262.03. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is an unnecessary hardship with
respect to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to
maintaining the riparian setback established in this regulation, such as to
justify the granting of a variance, the Planning Commission shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
      (2)   Variance shall be void if not implemented within one (1) year of
the date of issuance.
 
   (b)   In making a determination under Section
1540.09(a) of this regulation, the Planning Commission shall consider the
following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-yr. floodplain. The criteria of Chapter
1472, Flood Damage Prevention, may be used as guidance when granting variances
in the 100-yr. floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of the property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives of the proposed structure or
use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include procedures necessary to minimize erosion and control
sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation,
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the City of Pepper Pike. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or
concrete paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel
driveways when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
City of Pepper Pike, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
 
   (c)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Planning Commission,
for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate to
maintain the purposes of this regulation and to mitigate any necessary impacts
in the riparian setbacks permitted by variance. In determining appropriate
mitigation, the Planning Commission may consult with the City Engineer or other
agencies including Cuyahoga SWCD.
(Ord. 2013-17. Passed 9-25-13.)
 
1540.12 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   The identification of riparian setbacks shall be inspected by the City of
Pepper Pike:
   (a)   Prior to soil disturbing activities authorized under this regulation.
The applicant shall provide the City of Pepper Pike with at least two (2)
working days written notice prior to starting such soil disturbing activities.
   (b)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the City of Pepper
Pike that uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to
violate the provisions of this regulation.
      (Ord. 2008-16. Passed 5-21-08.)
 
1540.13 FEES.
   At the time of submission of the application the applicant shall deposit
with the City of Pepper Pike Treasurer an amount of funds as determined by the
City of Pepper Pike Engineer, not less than three hundred ($300.00), to cover
the cost and expense of such review of the Application and prepare a report for
the Planning Commission. The cost and expense of such investigation shall be
deducted from such deposit. If such expenditure exceeds the deposit, such
excess shall be paid to the City of Pepper Pike by the Applicant. If such
deposit exceeds such expenditure, the balance shall be refunded to the
applicant.
(Ord. 2008-16. Passed 5-21-08.)
 
1540.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person who shall violate any section of this regulation shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of first degree and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
subject to punishment as provided in Chapter
1540 and shall be required to restore the riparian setback through a
restoration plan approved by the Planning Commission.
 
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the City of Pepper Pike from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a Court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful
development, or to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require
compliance with the provisions of this regulation or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders of the City of Pepper Pike
