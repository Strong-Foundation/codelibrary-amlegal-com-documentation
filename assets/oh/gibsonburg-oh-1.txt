of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before

hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Gibsonburg,
Ohio.
2.    That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in Section 4
of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted
prior to March 4, 1984, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor.
For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in full force
notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:

existing prior to March 4, 1984, shall be deemed to amend, replace or affect
the analogous or comparable section of the Codified Ordinances as reflected in
the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as otherwise indicated by the
content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
4.    That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety

that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number . 99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061,575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

amends the resolution. Committed fund balance also incorporates obligations to
the extent that existing resources in the fund have been specifically committed
to satisfy contractual requirements.
      (4)   “Assigned” - Assigned fund balances are intended for specific
purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or
committed. Governmental funds other than the general fund report all fund
balances as assigned unless they are restricted or committed. In the general
fund, assigned amounts represent intended uses established by Village Council
or a Village official delegated that authority by resolution, or by State
Statute.
      (5)   “Unassigned” - Unassigned fund balance is the residual
classification for the general fund and includes amounts not included in the
other classifications. In other governmental funds, the unassigned
classification is used only to report a deficit balance.
   (b)   Process. The Village applies restricted resources first when
expenditures are incurred for purposes for which either restricted or
unrestricted (committed, assigned, and unassigned) amounts are available.
Similarly, within unrestricted fund balance, committed amounts are reduced
first followed by assigned, and then unassigned amounts when expenditures are
incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of the unrestricted fund balance
classifications could be used.
(Ord. 11-2012. Passed 11-1-12.)
135.10  AUTHORITY TO SIGN ANY WARRANTS/CHECKS/DRAFTS.
   (a)   The Mayor, Fiscal Officer, and President Pro Tempore hereby have the
express authority to sign any warrants/checks, or drafts from any depository
institution designated as depository for the Village.
 
   (b)   With this authority, at least two (2) of the three (3) above named
individuals in these positions must sign each warrant/check/or draft. (Ord. 12-
2015. Passed 6-18-15.)
135.11 EFT, ACH, OBG, AND ON-LINE BANKING POLICY.
   The following guidelines should be used whenever EFT (Electronic Funds
Transfer), ACH (Automated Clearing House), OBG (Ohio Business Gateway) or on-
line banking is initiated or received:
   (a)   Only the Village Fiscal Officer or the Assistant Fiscal Officer may
initiate or record any electronic transactions. Electronic transactions may
include, but are not limited to, recurring receipts from the State of Ohio or
the County Auditor, payment of payroll, payroll withholdings, recurring charges
such as monthly health insurance premiums (currently thru Anthem), BWC and
ODJFS fees, bank charges and fees, and automatic payment (deduction) of
resident monthly utility bills.
   (b)   All electronic transactions will be reviewed and approved by the
Finance Committee at least monthly. Reconcilement of electronic transactions
will be performed by the Fiscal Officer or the Assistant Fiscal Officer at
least monthly. After reconcilement, the Finance Committee and full Council will
review and approve all payments and reconcilement reports.
   (c)   On-line Banking: On-line transactions consisting of transfer of funds
between accounts at the same depository institution are acceptable. An example
would be transferring funds from the Village of Gibsonburg checking account to
a Village of Gibsonburg savings account or vice versa.
   (d)   The Village will accept receipt of funds by direct deposit when
required by the payer. Example of this include funds received from the Office
of Budget and Management, Sandusky County Auditor, Ohio Business Gateway, and
resident’s utility bill and tax credit card payments.
   (e)   All non-payroll EFT transactions should be reviewed and approved by
the Finance Committee prior to set-up and starting any automatic payment or
automatic deduction.
   (f)   Receiving billing notices or statements by e-mail do not require prior
approval unless they are also being set up for automatic payment. E-mailed
notices must still be approved by the initiator of the transaction regardless
of type of payment.
      (Ord. 17-2017. Passed 11-2-17.)
 
135.12  PETTY CASH POLICY.
   Effective with the approval of this policy (Ordinance 20-2018, November 15,
2018), the Village of Gibsonburg will require that the Village Administrator,
Fiscal Officer, Tax Commissioner, and Utility Clerk should adhere to the
adopted petty cash policy.
(Ord. 20-2018. Passed 11-15-18.)

   (a)   The Village of Gibsonburg maintains the following credit cards for use
in day to day operations of the Village:
   Old Fort Banking Company - Visa - Maximum credit limit =$4,000
(4798510065471340)
   The following employees have a specific card issued with their name:
      Marc Glotzbecker, Administrator
      Dan Collins, Police Chief
      Barb Wildermuth, Assistant Fiscal Officer
      Jennifer Cox, Utility Clerk
      Paul Clark
      Robert Helle
   Marathon Fleet card - Maximum credit limit = $5,000 (7560001134915)
   The following cards are listed by department and are kept in the specific
vehicles used by each department:
      Police
      Water department
      Sewer department
      Street department
   Dollar General - Maximum credit limit = $400 (138038270660)
   Staples - Maximum credit limit - $10,000 (6035517820140241)
   Lowes - Maximum credit limit = $10,000 (489001083383099)
   Tractor Supply - Maximum credit limit = $10,000 (6035301203279326)
   (b)   The above cards, except for the Marathon Cards, are kept in a secured
location maintained by the Fiscal Officer. Whenever a Village employee requires
a credit card to make a purchase for Village use, they must request a card from
the Fiscal Officer and state what purchase will be made with the card. Each
time a card is requested from the Fiscal Officer, the employee must sign their
name, date, card name, and estimated usage amount on a form prepared by the
Fiscal Officer. The card may be used for an online purchase or an in store
purchase, but must be returned to the Fiscal Officer immediately after use. If
the card will be kept overnight due to lateness of the day, the card will be
returned as soon as possible the next business day.
   (c)   When the card is returned to the Fiscal Officer, the itemized receipt
and purchase order must be included showing date, item(s) purchased,
department, and employees signature. The Fiscal Officer will notate receipt of
the returned credit card. If these requirements are not adhered to, the
employee who made the purchase in question may be required to reimburse or pay
for that purchase from their own personal funds.
   (d)   In regards to the Marathon Card, each employee who purchases fuel for
a Village vehicle, must sign and date the receipt and provide it to the Fiscal
Officer as soon as practical. The receipt should also provide the department
and to which vehicle the purchase was made.
   (e)   The Village of Gibsonburg Council has authority to grant an officer,
employee, or staff member the authority to use a credit card account to
purchase Village work related goods and services incurred on behalf of the
Village. The work related goods and services include, but are not limited to,
gasoline for Village vehicles, and equipment or services purchased on behalf of
the Village project in which the authorized user is directly involved. No
purchase may exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000) unless prior notification is
provided to the Fiscal Officer of the need to exceed the two thousand dollars
($2,000) limit. In the event of an emergency, documentation must be provided to
the Fiscal Officer no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the transaction.
   (f)   Any and all transactions will be subject to the maximum credit limit
allowed for that specific credit card.
   (g)   At least quarterly, preferably monthly, the Fiscal Officer will
provide the Finance Committee with a breakdown of the credit card transactions
made. The Finance Committee will review and make a recommendation to the
Village Council to accept those transactions.
   (h)   Each month, when the Fiscal Officer receives the statement of all
invoices for the month, for each credit card, the statement must be reconciled
with all transactions entered into UAN for that period.
   (i)   The use of a credit card account for expenses beyond those authorized
by the Village of Gibsonburg may constitute misuse of a credit card account.
Any officer, or employee, or public servant of the Village of Gibsonburg who
knowingly misuses a credit card account held by the Village of Gibsonburg
violates section 2913.21 of the Ohio Revised Code, which is a misdemeanor of
the first degree and would be held personally liable for any unauthorized
transactions.
   (j)   All requests to obtain a credit card from a new vendor, must be
approved by the Village Council. The request must include the name of the
vendor, who will use the card(s), purpose of the cards, and what limit is
requested for total monthly purchases.
   (k)   Anytime a credit card is not used for a reasonable period, the card
may be cancelled and notification should be provided to the Village Council. If
any person has knowledge that a Village credit card has been compromised,
whether by fraud or misuse, or the card is lost or stolen, the Fiscal Officer
must immediately be notified and the vendor contacted to cancel the card. Any
transactions not authorized by a Village officer or employee, must be disputed,
notification must be given to the vendor, and notification provided to Council.
Council may then approve and authorize re-issuance of the card if the prior
procedures have been followed and the vendor is able to reissue the card within
safe guidelines.
   (l)   The Fiscal Officer will prepare a report annually to the Village
Council which states any and all rewards received, based on the use of the
Village of Gibsonburg credit card accounts.
   (m)   The Village of Gibsonburg no longer uses any credit card(s) issued
thru Fifth Third Bank.
   (n)   The Village of Gibsonburg does not currently use or have any debit
card(s).
   (o)   Any issues related to the Village of Gibsonburg's credit card policy
which are not stated above, may be addressed in HB312.

   (b)   The Commission members shall elect a President, Vice-President, and a
Secretary who shall service without pay. Election of officers shall be held
annually.
   (c)   The members of the Commission shall meet at least once a month.
   (d)    The purpose of the Commission shall be to gather input from the many
different areas of the community for the purpose of revitalization of our
community Recreation Programming, Activities and Facilities.
   (e)   The Advisory Commission has no legal powers and can only recommend.
Its function as its name implies, is simply advisory. Its recommendations may
be accepted and implemented, or they can be disregarded. It has no power to
enforce its determinations. The Advisory Committee provides municipal
authorities with a community sounding board through the participation of
representative local citizens.
   (f)   Policy developments and implementation in these municipalities become
the responsibility of the Village Administrator with the approval of Village
Council. The Advisory Board is valued for its ability to interpret community
needs and desires as well as to interpret official municipal actions to the
various community constituencies represented by advisory committee
members.Citizen input is critical on the Recreation Advisory Committee, for
example, some such citizens have specialized professional knowledge that is
very valuable; others provide general interpretation of citizen needs and
reactions, which is essential to sounding planning. Manpower for data
collection and other elements of the planning process also frequently depends
on the cooperation and support of individual citizens and groups they
represent. Neighborhoods and community committees also form other leisure
services concerns; holiday and special events programs; studies of fees and
charges, concession policies, and related fiscal issues; and facility
development and design. All these require effective citizen involvement in
support of board or commission policy determinations.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor’s Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R. C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R. C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto. "
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made nausrtpu to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. "
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.”
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

171.01 TERMlNATION; REACTIVATION.
   (a)    The Mayor's Court of the Village shall cease operation for a period
of 180 days and shall thereafter remain inactive unless Council, by ordinance
reactivates the Mayor's Court.
   (b)    Upon termination of Mayor's Court activities, all cases originating
in the Village shall be filed with the Sandusky County Court or such other
court as the legislature may designate as the successor court to the present
county court system.
   (c)    The Mayor and Clerk-Treasurer are hereby authorized and directed to
execute the necessary documents required by the Sandusky County Court and/or
the Sandusky County Clerk of Courts to facilitate the transfer of the Mayor's
Court functions to the Sandusky County Court and to arrange for the payment of
costs and the distribution of the moneys received by such Court.
(Ord. 20-84. Passed 8-6-84.)
171.02 SPECIAL SESSION FOR INCOME TAX VIOLATIONS.
   (a)    Council has determined that it is in the public interest and welfare
to establish a special Mayor's Court session for enforcement of income tax
violations filed by the Gibsonburg Income Tax Administrator.
   (b)    A special Mayor's Court session be and hereby is authorized and
established to enforce violations of the various income tax ordinances and
provisions of the Village including but not limited to, failure to file a
return, filing of a false or fraudulent return, failure or neglect to pay the
income tax, failure to withhold taxes and providing false information.
   (c)    Mayor's Court sessions are to be considered special as there are no
regular Mayor's Court sessions in the Village and shall be limited to municipal
income tax violations. In all cases where a plea of not guilty is made in
Mayor's Court requiring a trial, such cases shall be transferred to the
jurisdiction of the Sandusky County Court, District #2, Woodville, Ohio, as the
Mayor would have a conflict of interest from hearing such cases in that they
affect the Village collection of funds. Only contested cases such as those
shall the Mayor be considered to have such a conflict of interest, all other
cases shall be capable of proceeding under the Mayor in Mayor's Court special
session as established herein.

191.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required.
   If a term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is
not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title
LVII of the Ohio Revised Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)    Division (1 )(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250

the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

of this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1 , 2017.
      The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit
that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal
taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating
loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years
than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1 )(H)

available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.
         (v)    Nothing in division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a

not fully utilized by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1 )(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.

made the election described in division (47)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(23)(D) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (1) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (2)    (A)    "ASSESSMENT" means any of the following:

equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
191.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following

to make payments under division (B)( 1 )(b) of this section of taxes required
to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars.
      Payment under division (8)(1)(b) of this section shall be made so that
the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days
after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
191.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)    (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

         (b)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
191.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
191.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax
Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the manner in
which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
191.051 of this Chapter.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
      
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.

         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.

for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
   
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
191.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and returns
required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)    "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)    "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)    "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined
in Section
191.03(23).
         (ii)    "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

      (2)    "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
191.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)    "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

191.062 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
Businesses.
   (A)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (A)(2) and (B) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.052;
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
191.19(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
191.19(A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (A)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (A)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (A)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (A)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (B) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Village from a
location outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (A)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Left intentionally blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (B)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Chapter
191 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (B)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (B)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (B)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (A)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Chapter
191.
         (Ord. 28-2023. Passed 12-21-23.)
191.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   
   (B)    (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)    The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)    A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   
   (E)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
191.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
191.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

payment, or credit from another taxable year.
   (B)    (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)    A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under section 718.031 of the Ohio Revised Code are deemed to be paid to the
municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes
are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
191.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)    (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
191.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
191.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

191.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
191.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
191.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121 (v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)    (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)    (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71 , or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
191.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
191.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
191.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
191.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)    (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
191.051 (C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)    (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041 , form 1065, form 1120, form

refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)    A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)    (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         (c)    In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
191.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
191.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 191.092 of this Chapter
prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (C) of Section
191.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim , statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)    (1)    As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
191.052 of this chapter.
      (2)    A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules ." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)    (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

this division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)    (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the

the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided

state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due

forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
191.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including

documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.18 of this Chapter.

ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
191.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
191.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of th is
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
191.15 of this Chapter; and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or

does not include ordinary
correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts
or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
191.15 of this Chapter,
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed ail information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)    (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11 (A)( 4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board,
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 22-2015. Passed 12-17-15.)
191.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)    (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
191.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
191.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
191.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
191.30  to

remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator

prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as

(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.31 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
191.30  to
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
191.03  of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in Sections
191.30  to
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
191.30  to
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
191.32  of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of Section
191.03  of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
191.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
191.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (L)(2) of Section
191.03  of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (D)(5) of Section
191.03  of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
191.03 (47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
191.30  to
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
191.30  to
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.

191.32 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.051  of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Business, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A) of Section
191.03  of the Codified Ordinances by the Village to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to the Village any amount other than the amount upon which
the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

         (Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.34 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return

calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
191.31 (E),
191.32 , and, if applicable,
191.36  of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the

manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding
for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial
election unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law.
The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period
unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (B)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section

taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section 718.81 of the
Revised Code to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.32  of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
191.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
191.32  of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is

having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.

      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made

payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.39 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
191.15  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.40 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 718.91 of the Revised Code, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.41 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.42 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
191.30  of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in Section
191.19  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 5-3-18.)
191.43 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under Section
191.30  through
191.45  of the Codified Ordinances or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane

is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
       REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)

unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

      (6)   The applicant shall have thirty days following notification of
permit denial by the Police Chief to request, in writing, a formal hearing
before Village Council, for the purpose of showing cause as to why the permit

imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.04. The Parking Violations Bureau shall
be within the Gibsonburg Police Department. The Parking Violations Bureau has
jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the territory of
the Village of Gibsonburg. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, each parking infraction that occurs within the jurisdiction of the
Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of each such parking infraction
shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)    The operating costs of the Parking Violations Bureau shall be paid by
the Village of Gibsonburg. The Mayor and/or Village Administrator shall appoint
the Violations Clerk, necessary clerical employees and hearing examiners. No
person shall be employed as a hearing examiner unless such person is an
attorney admitted to the practice of law in the State of Ohio or is a former
law enforcement officer.
   (c)    The fines, penalties, fees, and costs established for a parking

hearing examiners as prescribed in this chapter, or the ultimate responsibility
of the Violations Clerk to collect, retain, and disburse fines, penalties,
fees, and costs for parking infractions and monies paid in satisfaction of
judgments and default judgments entered pursuant to this chapter. All contracts
entered into by the Mayor and/or Village Administrator shall be authorized by
Village of Gibsonburg Council. (Ord. 2-14. Passed 2-20-14.)
352.04  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE, AND LIABILITY.
   (a)    The parking ticket adopted in Section 352.10 hereof shall be used by
law enforcement officers in all cases in which a person is charged with
committing a parking infraction within the Village of Gibsonburg. The parking
ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of this chapter.
   (b)    A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction
charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator
in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Constructive service
of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by affixation as provided in
this Division, or by the procedure described in Division (d) of this Section,
has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects both the owner and the
operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and costs for
failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the
parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)    The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this Section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the Village of Gibsonburg and of the law enforcement agency whose
officer issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)    An operator of a vehicle, who is not the owner of the vehicle, but
who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the
agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this Section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this Section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle, whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction, shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement.
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
352.09 hereof.
   (e)    Except as provided in Section
352.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is
served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle, whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued,
and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different,
are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle, who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter, may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle,
whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction.
(Ord. 2-14. Passed 2-20-14.)
352.05 ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)    A person, who is personally or constructively served with a parking

by appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail. An
answer shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of the infraction and
shall be in one of the following forms:
      (1)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction,
with an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)    A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the
presence at the hearing of the law enforcement officer, who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction,
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination. If the Parking
Violations Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates the fact that the
person committed the parking infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall
eliminate or reduce the amount of the fine arising out of the parking
infraction. If the fine is eliminated or reduced and the person has previously
paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the revised fine shall be returned
to the person; if the fine is eliminated or reduced and the person has not
previously paid the fine, the person shall pay only the amount of the revised
fine. If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation does not
mitigate the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the person
owes the entire amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction, and
if the person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay the entire
amount of the fine. If a person admits that he committed a parking infraction
with explanation and the person fails to pay the amount of the fine due within
ten (10) days after receiving notice of the Parking Violations Bureau's
determination, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the Parking
Violations Bureau's determination and the amount of the fine due shall be
considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a judgment rendered
subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b) of Section
352.07 hereof.
      (3)    A person, who denies that he committed a parking infraction, shall
be granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
352.07 hereof.
   (c)    If a person, who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, fails to timely
answer the charge, as provided in subsection (a) of this Section, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant
to Section
352.06 hereof, and proceed according to that Section. Failure to answer the
charge within the ten (10) day period provided by subsection (a) of this
Section, shall result in the imposition of an additional penalty of fifteen
dollars ($15.00).
   (d)    The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

352.07 HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)    If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives a
notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each
hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner considers
appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
   At the hearing, the Village of Gibsonburg has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being
conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in his answer,
denied that he committed the parking infraction and requested the presence at
the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the
officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner
determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the officer's
presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable to attend
the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may
grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is being
conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing. The
person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary evidence
to the hearing examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
   The Village of Gibsonburg shall submit the original parking ticket that was
personally or constructively served on the person or a true copy of that
ticket, and information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the
owner of the vehicle. The ticket and the information in proper form is prima-
facie evidence that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who
committed the parking infraction. The Village of Gibsonburg may present
additional evidence and testimony at the hearing. The Village of Gibsonburg
does not have to be represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   (1)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) of this Section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits
evidence in accordance with that division, the hearing examiner shall consider
all evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the Village of
Gibsonburg has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person
committed the parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines that the
person committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a
judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate
fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) of this Section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that Division, the hearing examiner shall,
if he determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A default
judgment entered under this Division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)    If a person, who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
352.06 hereof, does not timely answer, as provided in subsection (c) of that
Section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)    If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsection (b )
(1), (2), or (3) of this Section committed the parking infraction, the hearing
examiner shall enter judgment against the Village of Gibsonburg, shall dismiss
the charge of the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)    A default judgment entered under this Section may be vacated by
the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one ( 1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
         B.    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose;
         C.    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)    Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this Section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten (1 0) days of
the date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default
judgment shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the Village of
Gibsonburg and the Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the
money and its disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If
payment is not made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment
may be filed with the office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so
filed, shall have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil
action rendered in the Court.
      (1)   As required by Division (C) of Ohio R.C. 4521.08, judgments and
default judgments filed with the Sandusky County Court #2, office of the Clerk
of Court, Civil Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment
roll from other judgments rendered in that Court.
      (2)   Computer printouts, microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or other
similar data recording techniques may be utilized to record such judgments.
When a judgment or default judgment is filed with the Court, execution may be
levied, and such other measures may be taken for its collection as are
authorized for the collection of an unpaid money judgment in a civil action
rendered in that Court. The Court may assess additional costs against the
judgment debtor, in an amount not exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) for each
parking infraction, to be paid upon satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)    Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is entered
pursuant to this Section and the Village of Gibsonburg if judgment is entered
against the Village of Gibsonburg pursuant to this Section may appeal the
judgment or default judgment to the ## County Municipal Court by filing notices
of appeal with the Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within
fifteen (15) days of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of
such reasonable costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the
Court shall schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time,
and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance
with the rules of the Court. Service of a notice of appeal under this Division
by a person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default
judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files
the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the
judgment, plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of the
Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the Parking Violations
Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Court may be taken.
   (e)    A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this Section may
be filed with the Sandusky County Court #2, office of the Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, under Division (c) of this Section at any time within three (3) years
after the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose. This Division applies to any ticket
issued for an offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the
effective date of this Section, if the ticket was issued within three (3) years
prior to the effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued
and served on the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or

Municipality for purposes of this section.

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. (ORC 2909.03)

involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

treatment process.
         (Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.03 USE AND REQUIREMENTS OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)    Prohibition on Unpolluted Water. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged any unpolluted surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, storm
water, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any existing roof drain
connections to sanitary or combined sewers shall be connected into an available
storm sewer or shall be disconnected above ground in an appropriate manner
approved by Council. Discharges from roof drains emptying onto the ground
surface shall be at least three feet from adjacent property line and shall in
no way be directed to flood or otherwise cause damage to adjoining property.
The owner of any building(s) situated within the Village is required at his
expense to disconnect all existing roof drains from sanitary and combined
sewers in accordance with the provisions of this section within 180 days after
the date of official notice to do so. Discharge units connecting to a Village
sanitary sewer or combination sewer shall be free of all storm water. It is
prohibited that any new construction of discharge units shall have any storm
water connections of roof drains, footer and foundation tiles or any other
connection to a sanitary sewer or combination sewer.
   (b)    Allowable Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically
designated as acceptable combined sewers or storm sewers or to a natural outlet
approved by Council and other regulatory agencies.
   (c)    Wastewater Discharge. Discharge units having sanitary water shall be
connected to a Village sanitary sewer, if one is within 200 feet of any of the
lot or property lines of that discharge unit. If a sanitary sewer is not
available within 200 feet of the lot or property line, the discharge unit shall
be connected to a combined sewer or an approvable individual sewage treatment
system. In either such event, the connection shall be watertight from the
discharge unit to the sewer.
   (d)    No new connections or alterations to existing connections shall be
made to any of the sewer systems of the Village without prior permission of the
Village Council or its authorized representative, nor shall the Village allow
any new connections unless there is sufficient downstream sewer capacity and
sufficient treatment capacity.
   (e)    Fees for connection to Village sewers shall be in accordance with a
schedule adopted by Council. (Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.04 CONTROL OF PROHIBITED WAST ES.
   (a)    Regulatory Actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described
in Section
929.02 are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
Village or to any sewer system tributory thereto, the Superintendent or Village
Legal Advisor may take any action necessary to:
      (1)    Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      (2)    Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications
will control, reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in
conformity with this chapter. This may include control over the quantities and
rates of discharge.
      (3)    Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization, necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable
characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate these
rules and regulations.
      (4)    Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to
pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the Village for handling and
treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      (5)    Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable
or necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter.
   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major contributing
industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment standards or best
practical control technology currently available for incompatible pollutants as
published in the latest Federal Regulations, unless the Village is committed,
in its NPDES permit to remove a specified precentage of the incompatible
pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment standards may be
correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the Engineer, or his duly
authorized representative or State regulatory agencies.
   Special Conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment.
Any industrial concern may appeal to the Council and determination made by the
Engineer in the enforcement of this chapter.
   After passage of this chapter, each person whose operation entails the
discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with
the Engineer a written statement setting forth the nature of the operation
contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of water required
for use, the proposed point of discharge of such wastes into the wastewater
collection system of the Village, subject to possible payment therefor by the
industrial concern for subsequent treatment, the estimated amount to be so
discharged and a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial, physical,
chemical and other known characteristics of such wastes. Within a reasonable
time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of the Village to make
an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the judgment of the Engineer
may be necessary. Any industrial concern may appeal to Council any
determination made by the Engineer in the enforcement of this chapter designed
to adequately guard against unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater system.
   (b)    Submission of Plans.
      (1)    Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to
discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is required, plans,
specifications, other pertinent data or information, including installation of
facilities and equipment relating to such pretreatment or flow-control
facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent.
Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities from compliance
with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such
pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to
and prior approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)    Grease and oil interceptors. For grease, oil and inorganic
material such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when in the
opinion of the Engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
Section
929.02 (d)(2), or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for private nlvlI quarters
or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Engineer, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s)
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent. Any removal and
hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner(s) personnel must
be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (c)    Pretreatment Facilities Operations. If pretreatment of control of
waste flows is required, such facilities shall be continuously maintained in
good working order and operated as effectively and efficiently as possible by
the owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements
of these rules and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances and
laws.
   (d)    Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the
purposes of these rules and regulations, the Superintendent, upon the
presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at
reasonable times for the purpose of copying any records required to be kept
under the provisions of this chapter, inspecting any monitoring equipment or
methods, and sampling any discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. The
Superintendent may enter upon the property at any hour under emergency
circumstances.
   (e)    Protection from Accidental Discharge.  Each industrial user shall
provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or
operator's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Superintendent for review, and shall be approved by him before construction of
the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility
as necessary to meet the tnemeriu,eqr of this chapter.
   (f)    Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility
does not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or
limitations in this chapter, the facility responsible for such discharge shall
immediately notify the Superintendent so that corrective action may be taken to
protect the treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to the
Superintendent detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge,
the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken
to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial
facility within five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.05 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)    Discharge Reports.
      (1)    Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge
report at such intervals as are designated by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing
to discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      (2)    The discharge report shall include, but, in the discretion of the
Superin- tendent, shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of
flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to
the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they
are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Superintendent may require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
   (b)    Records and Monitoring.
      (1)    All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)    Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial
user's compliance with this chapter shall be prepared as requested and
submitted to the Superintendent.
      (3)    The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (4)    Wastewater volume determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption of
the person as shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by the
Village except as herein provided in this paragraph.
   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the Village water
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the person
shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved by
the Engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
those other sources. Access to these meters shall be made available to
representatives of the District at any reasonable time. The accuracy of such
meters shall be verified at the discharger's expense on a once per two year
basis at a minimum or at the request of the Superintendent by an independent
testing company.
   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers may install
and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the volume of
waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial waste
surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the Engineer.
   The Engineer may require the installation of devices for measuring the
volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records. Any metering device for determining the
volume of waste discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned and
maintained by the person responsible for its discharge. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Engineer.
      (5)    The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area,
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or
sidewalk and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (6)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)    Inspection, Sampling and Analysis.
      (1)    Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect
to Section
929.02  prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a twenty-four hour period or over a longer or shorter
time span, as determined necessary by the Superintendent to meet the needs of
specific circumstances.
   Sampling and monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers
shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Engineer but in no case less than two twenty-four
hour composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples. Samples shall be
collected in such a equipment manner as to be representative of the composition
of the wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of automatic
sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples. Access to sampling
locations shall be granted to the Engineer or his authorized representative at
all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to insure
their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the same was
taken.
      (2)   Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analysis of
industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current
edition of "Standard Methods" or the "Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water
and Waste" published by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Analysis of
those pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in
accordance with procedures established by the State Environmental Protection
Agency. However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes
may be used subject to mutual agreement between the Engineer and the person
responsible for its discharge. Determination of the character and concentration
of the industrial wastes shall be made by the person responsible for the
discharge, or his qualified agent as approved by the Engineer. The results of
the analyses shall be reported to the Village on a monthly basis on forms
provided by the Village. The Village shall make its own analyses on the wastes
and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances in the following paragraph.
   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village and the
industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the
latest edition of "Standard Methods" and the differences negotiated. (Ord. 6-
86. Passed 2-20-86.)

by the water used by each sewer user as shown by the water meter readings. The
sewer user charge for residents of Gibsonburg shall consist of a debt service
charge of five dollars and forty-two cents ($5.42) per month and a user charge
of one dollar and fifty-eight cents ($1.58) per month and seventy cents ($.70)
per 100 cubic feet. The sewer rental charge for nonresidents of Gibsonburg,
that is users whose property served by the Gibsonburg sewer system is located
outside the corporate limits of Gibsonburg shall pay the rate established and
approved prior to receiving wastes and levied to equalize local capital costs
by the Village.
   The sewer user charge system will be audited annually by the Village to
assure that the system is and will continue to be self-sufficient and that
sufficient revenue is being generated from each user class in the proper
proportions.
   The sewer charge herein assessed shall be in addition to the charge made for
water used.
   Where a private water supply is used, the sewer user charge may be
calculated by requiring the property owner to meter the private water supply,
such metering to be at the property owner's expense and such measurement to be
used in the same manner as a public water meter in determining the charge. The
Board may at its option, in lieu of such metering, apply a sewer charge of
fifteen dollars ($15.00) per month to such premises. Each residence,
institution, commercial or industrial establishment shall be subject to a
separate sewer user charge even though such establishment may be served by a
sewer connection common to other premises. If it be found by the resident that
the water or waste measured or metered for any customer is greater than that
actually being discharged directly or indirectly into the sewage system, the
Board may modify and adjust such volume in accordance with the facts and with
justice and equity, but no charge less than the minimum shall be made for any
customer subject to the sewer charge.
   Where a private water supply is used and/or the user desires to meter his
water use or sewage flow, the owner shall incur all expenses related to the
installation of such meter. Prior to installation of the meter, the type of
equipment installed and its location must be approved by the Village. Prior to
placing such meter into use after installation, the Village shall inspect and
approve the meter installation. Any modifications required by the Village shall
be made at the user's expense and prior to the meter's use. The meter shall be
located in a suitable location that will accommodate readings by Village
personnel. Tampering with the meter by the user to cause inaccurate readings
shall make the user subject to the penalty provisions of Section
929.99.
   Industrial wastewater into the public sewers as determined by this chapter
shall be subject to surcharges determined monthly on the basis of the following
formula:
   P equals (A) x BOD plus (B) x SS where A = $0.194 per lb. BOD 5/yr.
                   and B = $0.194 per lb. SS l/yr.
   P equals monthly surcharge
BOD equals pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in excess of (300) mg/
l concentration in the wastewater.
SS equals pounds of suspended solids per month in excess of (300) mg/
l concentration.
In the above formula A and B refer to the total expenditures per pound of BOD
and suspended solids, respectively, to collect, convey and treat the
wastewater, which shall be determined annually by the Board.
   Industrial cost recovery will be established, if an industrial user begins
discharging, in accordance with CFR 35.928 or latest revisions thereto.
(Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.07 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER RENTAL CHARGE.
   Where a sewer is available it will be presumed that the waste from the
premises either will be discharged directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system and the property will be subject to the current sewer rental charges.
   Where premises are not served directly or indirectly by the sewerage system
and should be exempt from the sewer rental charge, it will be the
responsibility of the property owner or other interested party to notify the
Board of such claim for exemption. All lots, lands, buildings or premises owned
by the Village shall be subject to the sewer rental charge as set forth herein.
(Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.08 LIEN OF SEWER RENTAL.
   The owner of each lot, land or premises connected to the sanitary or
combined sewer system in the Village or having such connection available shall,
as well as the lessee of such lot, land or premises, be liable to the Village
for any charge or rental levied by this chapter. All charges for rentals shall
be collected by Council, which Council shall make and enforce such by-laws,
rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary.
(Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86. )
929.09 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Notification of Violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
person has violated or is violating this chapter, or any prohibition,
limitation or requirement contained herein, he may serve upon such person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable
time, not to exceed thirty days, for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (b)    Legal Action. Any discharge in violation of the substantive
provisions of this chapter or an order of Council shall be considered a public
nuisance. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes
into the Village treatment system contrary to the substantive provisions of
this chapter or any order of Council, the Village shall commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate court of this
County.
(Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)
929.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates an order of the Village hearing authority or who willfully
or negligently fails to comply with any provisions of this chapter, and the
orders, rules and regulations issued hereunder, shall be fined not more than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense, but in no case shall the costs
be less than those costs incurred by the Village for reasonable damages or
special expenses including equipment rental, chemicals, labor, etc., necessary
for the proper operation and maintenance of all wastewater facilities. Each day
on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the Village may
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees, and any
other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person
found to have violated this chapter or the orders, rules and regulations issued
hereunder. (Ord. 6-86. Passed 2-20-86.)

937.00 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    Owner: Owner means any person and all persons owning a legal or
equitable freehold interest in the premises receiving water and/or sewer
service. This will include, but not be limited to, legal owners of record,
legal owners not of record, sellers under a land installment contract or other
contract of sale, purchasers under a land installment contract or other
contract of sale, and their heirs and devisees of a deceased owner.
   (b)    Delinquent: An account is to be considered delinquent when a monthly
payment becomes past due. Partial payments do not constitute good standing and
an account will remain delinquent until paid in full.
      (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.01  BILLING AND PAYMENT.
   (a)    For both residential and commercial properties, the Village shall
obtain actual
consumption amounts by reading utility service meters on a bi-monthly basis.
Should conditions render the Village unable to read a meter in a given billing
period, the Village will estimate consumption based on the historical usage
data for that property, and will generate a utility bill based on the estimated
usage so calculated. Charges for estimated consumption shall be adjusted on the
next utility bill reflecting actual meter readings.
   (b)    The Village shall provide each customer a monthly billing detailing
utility charges and consumption for the given billing period, with every other
month being an estimated or actual reading subject to the preceding paragraph.
The base charge shall be accessed at the beginning of each billing period.
   (c)    The billing period being for a utility bill received in any given
month will ordinarily be that period from the fifteenth (15) of two (2) months
prior to the fifteenth (15) of one (1) month prior.
   (d)    The Village Fiscal Officer shall:
      (1)   Schedule the statement mailing and payment dates for all accounts.
Scheduled mailing dates shall be at least 14 days before due dates.
      (2)   Insure that utility bills shall be provided to customers at or near
the beginning of each month, the terms of payment for all utility bills are:
due and payable in full upon receipt.
      (3)   Insure that the water billing office is staffed and remains open
for business, during posted hours Monday through Friday, excluding legal
holidays.
   (e)    Customers shall have the fourteen days to pay in full before a ten
percent (10%) late charge is added to the amount due. An additional 0.0833%
will be charged each month for which a past due bill is unpaid in full. If the
fourteenth day of the month is a legal holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, the due
date shall be extended to the next regular business day immediately following
the holiday or weekend day.
   (f)    The Fiscal Officer is authorized to excuse penalties only where the
Village utilities billing office is clearly at fault in the processing of bills
or where the account has been improperly handled by the Village. No penalty
will be excused for reasons of non-receipt of mailed bills due to improper
handling by the mail service or incorrect address.
   (g)    Utility bills not paid in full by the beginning of the next billing
period are deemed delinquent and will be subjected to the Delinquency Policy
set forth in Section
937.06.
   (h)    The due date on a utility bill applies to current charges only and
does not extend or otherwise alter any previous due date, notice, or agreement
regarding past due charges for delinquent utility service. (Ord. 01-2010.
Passed 4-1-10.)
937.02 DETERMINATION OF PENALTY DATES AND SERVICE TERMINATION
   For the purposes of determining penalty dates or establishing a date for the
termination of service, payment must be actually received at the water billing
office, or by agents duly authorized by the Village Fiscal Officer to receive
payment, by the date stated on the bill to be considered paid in full. Payments
placed in the Village Hall Drop Box will be considered current until the drop
box is emptied on the next regular business morning following the scheduled due
date. Remittance made by mail will be considered current provided that the
envelope postmark is on or before the scheduled due date.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.03 FINAL BILLS.
   (a)    Final bills are due upon receipt.
   (b)   The Village will attempt to read the meter on the scheduled final day.
If for any reason this is not possible the meter will be read the next business
day.
   (c)   A consumer must pay any outstanding final bill prior to establishing a
new account and receiving utilities at a new location.
   (d)   For rental units with individual meters the water will be shut off
upon final reading and will not be turned back on until either the landlord or
new renter executes for service agreement in accordance with this section.
   (e)   The Village Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized to write-off balances
on closed utility accounts which do not exceed ten dollars ($10.00).
   (f)   In the event a final utility account is closed and the customer has
overpaid on the account balance in an amount not to exceed ten dollars
($10.00), the Village Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized to impose an
administrative fee equal to said overpayment, provided; however, that said
administrative fee shall not be imposed if the consumer has provided a valid
forwarding address to which the Village Fiscal Officer may forward a refund, in
which case the Village Fiscal Officer shall forward a refund. The Village
Fiscal Officer shall notify Village utility customers of this section by
providing a copy of same with the Final Bill.
(Ord. 07-2012. Passed 11-1-12.)
937.04 RECEIPT OF PAYMENT
   (a)    When a statement is presented for payment with a remittance, the
Assistant Fiscal Officer’s stamp will constitute an official receipt. When a
utility bill is paid by mail or placed in a depository, a receipt will not be
issued unless the entire statement and a self-addressed stamped envelope
accompany the remittance. All receipts are void if a check used for payment
fails to clear through the banks.
   (b)    All monies received by the Utility Billing System for water, sewer,
and refuse bills will be credited to delinquent balances first and the
remainder to current charges of the appropriate accounts in the following
manner:
      (1)   The refuse bill will be credited in its entirety if there are
sufficient monies to pay it in full.
      (2)   Any balance which is not great enough to cover total remaining
water and sewer charges will be split and applied equally to water and sewer.
      (3)   If the amount owed of either water or sewer is less than the amount
split then the unused portion will be applied to the remaining balance of the
other account.
         (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.05 FAILURE TO RECEIVE UTILITY BILLING.
   The Village will not be responsible for failure of a customer to receive a
bill or notice. Utility bills will normally be mailed on the same date of each
month. If a bill is not received at the usual time of the month, inquiry should
be made by the customer. It is the customer's responsibility to keep the water
billing office notified of the correct address where bills are to be sent.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.06 SERVICE DISCONNECTION FOR NONPAYMENT OF UTILITY BILL.
   (a)    Notice of Delinquency. In the event a customer has not made payment
by the due date and the account is delinquent, the customer will be sent or
hand delivered a letter of delinquency stating that the account is past due.
The letter will indicate the exact amount due and the date and time by which
payment must be received. The letter will state the resident will be subject to
water service termination if not paid by the due date and time. The letter will
also notify the resident that a $50.00 shut off fee will be applied to the
account when the water service is terminated for nonpayment. Generally water
shut offs will be performed Monday through Thursday.
   (b)    Termination of Service.
      (1)   On the Day of Service Termination another door hangar will be
placed at the residence/business. If service must be terminated due to
nonpayment, the $50.00 shut-off fee will be applied to the utility account and
service will not be restored until the full delinquent balance and the penalty
are paid in full. A $25.00 turn-on fee will be accessed if service is not
restored the same day as shut-off.
      (2)   Payments returned from the bank will be charged back to the utility
account and an additional $35.00 bank fee will be applied to the account. The
resident will be notified immediately by telephone and letter that the check
was returned and cash or money order must be received immediately to compensate
for the returned check.
      (3)   Should a customer turn his/her water service back on without
Village approval, he/she may be subject to legal prosecution for tampering with
Village property. Additionally, the water/sewer service shall be shut-off
immediately, and an additional $50.00 penalty will be assessed.
   (c)    Protest Termination of Service.
      (1)   The customer is responsible for taking appropriate steps to avoid
service disconnection by keeping their account current. In the event the amount
of the bill or the accuracy of the meter is questioned, the customer shall pay
the amount billed to avoid service disconnection. After a determination is made
in the matter, any excess charge will be promptly refunded by the Village. In
the event the account does become delinquent and the delinquency bill becomes
past due, service shall be disconnected and will not be restored until the
account is paid in full, including any service charge. No payment plan will be
allowed for accounts that have become delinquent.
      (2)   Customers who feel their service is designated for termination of
service for nonpayment in error, may request a hearing by contacting the
Village Fiscal Officer prior to service termination.
         (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.07 RESTORATION OF SERVICE AFTER DELINQUENT PAYMENT IS MADE.
   (a)   Water service will be restored to a customer after payment has been
received in full in the utility billing office. In addition to the account
indebtedness, a service charge will be made. Once all water, sewer, and refuse
fees plus penalties are paid in full, water reconnection shall be accomplished
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, except
holidays. Any calls for reconnection after hours, on weekends, or on holidays
will be scheduled for the following workday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
3:00 p.m. The water service will ordinarily be turned on the next regular
working day after payment is received, during normal working hours. Exact time
for restoration of service is not guaranteed and the Village cannot be held
responsible for delays. If payment is received before 12:00 noon, service will
be scheduled for restoration on the same day.
   (b)   Service restoration will not be made unless the premises are occupied
or written authorization is provided by the property owner to the water billing
office at the time payment is made. This action is for the protection of the
customer, as plumbing fixtures may have been turned on while service was off.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.08 LEAKAGE
   (a)    If a meter reading is unusually high indicating a potential leak the
consumer will be notified immediately. If no one is at the property, a door
hanger will be left notifying the consumer of the situation and requesting that
they contact the Utility Billing Office as soon as possible.
   (b)    Water and sewer charges in case of a water leak occurring on the
consumer’s side of the meter, where the owner has immediately notified the
administration upon finding the leak and the leak has expeditiously been
corrected and the quantity of lost water was greater than three times the
owner’s average usage will be calculated as follows:
      (1)   The Village will adjust the water charges for the account to be
billed to an estimated usage of three times the past average usage based on
past history for that billing period.
      (2)   Where the lost water did not enter the Village sanitary sewer
system, the Village will adjust the sewer charges for the account to be billed
to an estimated usage of one times the past average usage based on past history
for that billing period. If the lost water did enter the Village sanitary
system the sewer charge will be based on actual or estimated water usage as
determined in the paragraph (b)(1).
      (3)   If an owner has a known leak which they neglect to correct on a
timely basis then the above adjustment is negated.
   (c)    Any adjustments to utility charges must be approved by the Village
Administrator or the Village Fiscal Officer. All adjustments will be documented
in the user account history. (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.09 RECEIPT OF BAD CHECKS
   (a)    Anyone tendering a check which fails to clear through the banks and
is returned to the utility billing office shall be assessed a service charge of
$35.00. This charge will be made against the premises served, if the maker of
the check or other negotiable instrument maintains water service connections,
in the same manner as charges for water or sewer service.
   (b)    Upon receipt of a bad check, identified by the bank as returned for
non-sufficient funds, the utility billing office will notify the maker, by
certified mail, that the check was returned, and payment in full, including all
service charges must be made within ten days of receipt of said notice. If
payment is not made by the date stated, or if the customer refuses to claim the
certified letter, the matter will be turned over to the Police Department for
investigation and possible criminal prosecution.
   (c)    Upon receipt of a bad check, identified by the bank as returned due
to the account being closed, no notice shall be sent to the customer. All
checks received written on a closed account will be immediately referred to the
Police Department for investigation and possible criminal prosecution.
   (d)    In the event the check is not made good, any receipts for payment
shall be void, the indebtedness shall be restored to the account, and the
status of the account shall be as before. Returned checks submitted for payment
of a delinquent account are subject to immediate termination of service.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.10 TENANTS RIGHTS TO OBTAIN WATER SERVICE
   At no time will the Village be a party to force eviction of a tenant by
accepting a request by the owner of a property or his agent to disconnect or
discontinue water service when the account is not delinquent. Even where an
account is delinquent, if the circumstances appear that the owner is trying to
force eviction, water service will be maintained, at the discretion of the
Village Administrator, after consultation with the Solicitor.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.11 PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBILITY
   (a)    The maintenance of water service connections is a substantial and
valuable benefit to land. Any owner of real estate premises maintaining such
water service connections shall assume responsibility for the total of all
water and/or sewer service charges levied against the premises during his/her
ownership in the same manner as the person who actually incurred the charges.
This assumption of responsibility is a necessary condition to the continuance
of water services to the premises and failure to pay such charges when properly
billed shall constitute grounds for the Village Administrator to refuse water
service to the premises.
   (b)    In the event a person incurs an obligation to pay for services
performed or water and/or sewer service, as an owner or tenant for one parcel
of real property, and that person subsequently moves to another location, such
person may be denied service if he/she is delinquent in payment for service at
the previous location.
   (c)    Furthermore, a person owning multiple pieces of property with
accounts in their name may be denied service at one or more properties for
delinquency at any location. If delinquent, the Village will not allow a new
account to be opened by a tenant at that location until the account is paid in
full.
   (d)    Owners of property shall be held responsible for utility charges on
their premises; but payments will be accepted from tenants.
   (e)    Past due bills from a previous property owner will become the
responsibility of the new property owner. It is the responsibility of the new
property owner to insure any past due bill is included as part of closing
costs.
   (f)    Upon the death of the owner of property, outstanding charges will
become a claim against the estate and will be collected in the normal fashion,
including, but not limited to, by action at law or certification to the real
property tax duplicate. As a courtesy to the estate representative and/or
survivors, invoices will continue to be sent to the address on file until an
application is made to change or update the account information.
   (g)    Delinquent bills may be certified to the County Auditor for
collection on the tax duplicate of Sandusky County, Ohio in the manner provided
by the Ohio Revised Code and the Codified Ordinances of the Village of
Gibsonburg, Ohio. This process occurs in September of each year. A fifty dollar
($50.00) processing fee will be added to any account which is certified to the
Auditor’s office.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.12 PURCHASER OF PROPERTY ENTITLED TO INFORMATION.
   If a property owner or a bona fide prospective purchaser of real estate
premises, requests information concerning water service charges levied against
said premises, the Village Administrator shall supply the information relating
to said charges known to exist at the time of the request. (Ord. 01-2010.
Passed 4-1-10.)
937.13 FAILURE TO RECEIVE UTILITY BILLINGS.
   All utility bills shall be mailed to the premises served or other address as
requested at the time service is initiated. Failure to request such listing or
receive any bill, invoice or notice does not relieve the customer from
responsibility for payment as required.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.14 DUPLICATE UTILITY BILLS
   In the event a customer does not receive a utility bill or has lost or
misplaced their utility bill, a duplicate may be obtained at the Water Office
upon request.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.15  PAYMENT PLAN.
   Water and/or sewer customers in good standing may apply for payment plans at
the utility billing office. Payment plans shall be either three or six months
in duration with all outstanding fees and/or charges paid in full at the end of
the plan. All regular charges incurred for usage during this time period must
be paid by the due date. Payment plans will not be made available for
delinquent accounts not paid in full by the date due on delinquency notices
unless the customer can provide proper documentation of unusual circumstances
that is approved by the Village Fiscal Officer. Failure to make payments under
the payment plan will result in the termination of service.
(Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.16 APPROVAL OF PAYMENT PLAN.
   All payment plans established for the provision of water and/or sewer
service shall be pre-approved by the Village Fiscal Officer, in writing, prior
to the payment plan taking
effect. (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.17 BANKRUPTCY.
   When any premises fall in arrears for payment of water and/or sewer bills
because they are subject to a bankruptcy court, the supply of water to such
premises may be continued or restored without previous payment of the water
bill accrued under the bankruptcy. After being supplied certified documentation
of bankruptcy, the then current account will be closed and frozen. A new
account will be set up which must be kept current from that time forward. The
frozen account will be reviewed by the Fiscal Officer and the Solicitor for
determination as to collection possibilities. (Ord. 01-2010. Passed 4-1-10.)
937.18 ADMINISTRATIVE FEES.
   (a)    The following schedule of administrative service fees shall be
charged.
      (1)   Termination of service (shut off)      $50.00
Waiver of shut-off and turn-on fee for leak repair. These fees will be waived
for line repair from water pit to the home or business. These fees will also be
waived one time for leaks within the home or business where no main shut off is
available. In cases of no existing internal shut off the owner will be notified
in writing that a shut off valve must be installed.
      (2)    Turn on fee following shut off       $25.00
Waiver of Turn-on fee. If turn-on is the result of a shut-off for non-payment
and service is to be restored the same day then turn-on fee will be waived.
      (3)    Returned Check fee             $35.00
      (4)    Certification to Auditor          $50.00
      (5)    Unauthorized Tampering          $50.00
Consumers are not to tamper with meter pit or meter without prior approval by
Village Water Superintendent or Administrator. The cost of any damage caused by
unauthorized tampering will be accessed to the account with an additional
$50.00 fee.
   (b)    Outstanding invoices sent to collection agency will be charged an
additional $50.00 processing charge.

1120.01 CHANGE OF USE REGULATIONS
   The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure on any lot or
premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this Ordinance,
supplement or amendment, may continue even though such use does not conform to
the provisions of this Ordinance. A non-conforming use of a building may be
changed to another non-conforming use of the same or more restricted
classification provided no structural alterations are made. Whenever a non-
conforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not be changed thereafter to a less restricted use.
   (a)   In the event that a non-conforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure and of any lot or premises is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of two years or more, any future use of the lot, building or structure shall be
in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (b)   Without the Board of Zoning Appeals' approval, a nonconforming use may
be extended throughout that portion of a structure that was obviously designed
and intended for such use. Also, a nonconforming structure may be extended or
enlarged by not more than ten percent of the total floor area existing at the
time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. However, no such extension
shall encroach upon any minimum yard requirements nor shall it exceed the
maximum height requirement.
   (c)   When a nonconforming building or structure has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, to the extent that more than 75 percent of its
fair market value is affected, it shall not be restored or reconstructed except
in conformity with regulations of the district in which the building or
structure is located.
   (d)   When a non-conforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage,
a building permit shall be secured for that purpose and reconstruction shall be
accomplished without undue delay. Failure to reconstruct within one year, will
result in revoking the right to non-conforming use and the premises shall now
have to conform to the established district regulations.
      (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1120.02 EXISTING STRUCTURE ENLARGEMENT.

   (a)   The purpose of a Planned Unit Development is to permit more
flexibility and therefore encourage imaginative and creative use and design of
structures and land that is not allowable under other districts of this
Ordinance, where such modifications shall not be contrary to the intent of this
Ordinance or inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan on which it is based. It
is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land,
while providing a variety of housing choices, a higher level of amenities, and
the preservation of the natural qualities of open space.
   (b)   It is not the intent of the Planned Unit Development provisions to
allow applicants to circumvent the intent of this Zoning Ordinance or to allow
development of land not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan of the
Village.
(Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.02 DESCRIPTION.

multi-family dwellings or any combination thereof, along with customary
accessory detached uses and structures are permitted in a Planned Unit
Development.
   (b)   Non-residential commercial uses, limited to those established in "C-2"

Commission are permitted in the Planned Unit Development, provided that such
uses are designed to serve primarily the residents of the Planned Unit
Development and are incorporated into a unitary design.
   (c)   Other non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, or recreational
character shall be permitted in a Planned Unit Development, provided that such
uses are designed to primarily serve the residents of the Development and are
incorporated into a unitary design.
   (d)   All permitted uses will be in conformance with a specific and precise
final developmental plan.
      (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.04 LOT AND YARD REGULATIONS.
   The minimum requirements established by the original district in which the
proposed Planned Unit Development is located shall act as a general guideline
for the lot and yard regulations. Consideration shall be given to lot and yard
regulations in the following manner:
   (a)   For the front, where the applicant provides for privacy by reducing
traffic flow through street layout such as cul-de-sacs, or by screening or
planting, or by facing the structure toward open space or a pedestrian way, or
through room layout of front elevation, it is possible to reduce front yard
requirements. At a minimum, all buildings and structures will be set back 50
feet from the centerline or 25 feet from the property line.
   (b)   The yard width and side yards, where the design is such that light,
air, and privacy can be provided, narrower lot width and side yard regulations
may be permitted.
   (c)   Unless it can be demonstrated to the Planning Commission that a lesser
rear yard requirement is justified; the rear yard shall be equal to or greater
than the rear yard requirements for the original district.
   (d)   The space between buildings may be reduced when adequate privacy,
light, and air are provided to each unit. At a minimum, spacing between the
sides of buildings shall be fifteen feet.
      (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.05 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   The following open space requirements are mandatory:
   (a)   Required open space shall comprise no less than 40 percent of the
total lot or parcel area.
   (b)   Areas covered with buildings, streets, parking lots, driveways and
other paved surfaces are not considered open space, except as noted in
subsection (c) below. A minimum of fifty percent of the required open space
shall be devoted to landscaping, patios, walkways and recreation areas for the
collective enjoyment and common use of occupants of the development.
   (c)   Recreation facilities or structures and their accessory uses located
in common recreation areas shall be calculated as open space, as long as the
total impervious surface (paving, roofs, etc.) constitute no more than 5
percent of the total required open space. (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.06 OPEN SPACE INTEGRITY.
   All land on the final development plan as common open space must be conveyed
under one of the following options:
   (a)   It may be conveyed to the Village if officials agree to maintain the
common open space and any buildings, structures, or improvements which have
been placed on it.
   (b)   It may be conveyed to a homeowners' association, of which all
homeowners within the Planned Unit Development must participate and said open
space deeded to the homeowners' association.
      (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.07 OPEN SPACE RESTRICTION.
   No common open space may be put to use without having been recorded in the
final development plan unless the final development plan has been amended to
permit that use under amendment procedures outlined in this Ordinance. However,
no authorized change of use may be considered as a waiver of any of the
covenants limiting the use of common open space areas.
(Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.08 HOMEOWNER’S ASSOCIATIONS.
   If the common open space is deeded to a Homeowners' Association, the
applicant shall file a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will
govern the association, to be submitted with the application for the pre-
application conference. The provisions shall include, but not be limited to the
following:
   (a)   The Homeowners' Association must be established before the units are
sold.
   (b)   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any successive
buyer.
   (c)   The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a period
of years.
   (d)   The Association must be responsible for liability insurance, taxes,
and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
   (e)   Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost; the assessment
levied by the association can become a lien on the property.
   (f)   The Association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet changing
needs.
      (Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.09 FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   In the event that the organization or any successor organization
responsible to own and maintain common open space, at any time after
establishment of the Planned Unit Development, fails to maintain the common
open space in a reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the
Planning Commission may cause service of written notice upon such organization
or upon the residents of the Planned Unit Development setting forth the manner
in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies
of maintenance be remedied within 30 days, and shall state the date and place
of a hearing thereon, which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At the
hearing the Planning Commission may modify the terms of the original notice as
to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they shall
be remedied. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or
modifications are not remedied within the 30 days or any extension, the
Village, in order to preserve taxable values of the properties within the
Planned Unit Development and to prevent common open space from becoming a
public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and maintain it for a
period of one year. The entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any
right to use the common open space, except when the open space is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration of the
organization responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, a public
hearing shall be scheduled upon notice to the organization or to the residents
of the Planned Unit Development, to be held by the Planning Commission at which
hearing, the organization or the residents of the Planned Unit Development
shall show cause why the maintenance by the Village shall not, at the election
of the Planning Commission, continue for a succeeding year.
   (b)   The cost of such maintenance by the Village shall be proportionally
assessed against the properties within the Planned Unit Development that have a
right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall become a tax lien on the
properties.
(Ord. 30-2007. Passed 12-20-07.)
1124.10 ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   The environmental design criteria in a Planned Unit Development shall
include the following: the preservation of trees, historic spots, and other
community assets and landmarks.
   (b)   In addition to this, the Administrator may require a grading plan
which will confine excavation, earth moving procedures, and other changes to
the landscape in order to insure preservation and prevent despoliation of the
character of the area retained as common open space. All manufactured slopes,
other than those constructed of rock, shall be of a character so as to cause
the slope to blend with the surrounding terrain and development. The developer

1140.01 VISION STATEMENT.
   (a)   The Village is committed to improving the health, safety, livability,
and opportunity of all its residents, regardless of age, ability, gender,
sexual orientation, income, or ethnicity. In making this commitment, the
Village recognizes that providing a safe, affordable, reliable, convenient,
comfortable, accessible, and equitable transportation network is essential.
Therefore, the Village shall, through the adoption of this Complete Streets
policy, consider all users of all abilities in all aspects of its
transportation funding, decision-making, planning, building, maintenance, and
operations to create a complete, connected transportation network. In doing so,
the Village will consider the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, people living
with disabilities, emergency responders, freight deliverers, commercial
drivers, and motorists at all stages of transportation planning.
   (b)   Complete Streets will encourage economic growth, increase property
values, improve safety and mobility, improve public health and fitness, and
reduce the overall demand on our roadways by allowing people to replace motor
vehicle trips with active transportation options. In addition, integrating
sidewalks, bike facilities, or safe crosswalks in the initial design of a
project spares the expense and complications of retrofits later.
   (c)   The Village vows to recogniz.e the historical aspects of the
transportation system within our Village, while also keeping safety and
accessibility in the highest regard. By adopting and implementing this policy,
the Village of Gibsonburg will create an equitable, balanced, and effective
transportation system where diverse users can travel safely and comfortably,
and where sustainable transportation options are available to everyone.
(Ord. 7-2022. Passed 5-19-22.)
1140.02  DIVERSE USERS.
   (a)   The Village shall provide transportation choices that are safe,
convenient, reliable, affordable, accessible, and timely for all users
regardless of age, ability, race, ethnicity, religion, income, gender,
identity, immigration status, language spoken, or access to a personal vehicle.
Transportation projects shall be designed and planned to accommodate all users
of the transportation system, including but not limited to people with
disabilities, the elderly, children, motorist/truck operators, pedestrians,
bicyclists, transit riders, people with pets, and emergency responders. When
designing and planning transportation infrastructure, the village will
prioritize the needs of people with disabilities, those over the age of sixty-
five (65), and children under the age of sixteen (16), so that proposed
improvements make a measurable difference in ease of travel, comfort, and
safety for these most vulnerable users.
   (b)   All users and all transportation modes shall benefit from Complete
Streets improvements. In addition to public transit users, those over the age
of sixty-five (65), under eighteen (18); low-income, and disabled populations
will be prioritized through Complete Streets improvements by enabling access to
community destinations by prioritizing improvements that increase:
      (1)   Access to health care services, grocery shopping, banking, and
other community resources located in the Village's central business district.
      (2)   Access to parks and outdoor recreation facilities for all users,
especially school-age children, and others without access to automobiles.

resurfacing, repaving, restriping, rehabilitation, or other types of changes to
the transportation system shall account for the needs of all modes of
transportation and all users of the road network.
   (b)   All construction and reconstruction/retrofit projects must also
provide accommodations for all modes of transportation to continue to use the
road safely and efficiently during any construction or repair work that
infringes on the right of way, bicycle facility, and/or sidewalk where
feasible.

order to achieve Complete Streets. For projects that are funded by non-
municipal governmental agencies such as state, federal, or county government,
the Village shall advocate that the project comply with the Complete Streets
policy. For a project inside village limits but outside its jurisdiction, the
Village shall advocate that the project complies with the Complete Streets
policy. For development projects that require review specified by the Zoning

compliance with the Complete Streets policy will be required. The Village shall
require all developers and builders to obtain and comply with the Village's
regulations. (Ord. 7-2022. Passed 5-19-22.)

uses, residents, and future development. Streets should serve the needs of all
users, whether they live along the street or are passing through.
   (b)   The Village will consider existing users and uses to avoid unnecessary
disruption and displacement of people and activities.
   (c)   The Village will adhere to Complete Streets principles when developing
or revising land-use tools. Village zoning, subdivision regulations, land-use

   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The manager shall provide
such staff assistance as is necessary and available. All municipal departments
and agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent
with this chapter, governing its procedures and transactions. The Design Review
Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
Certificate of Appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once a year. Special meetings may be held at the call of the
chairperson of the Design Review Board.
   (c)   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District, the Design Review
Board shall review any proposed new construction and alterations to property as
herein defined. The Board's approval of such new construction and alteration
shall be secured before any owner or property may commence work thereon. In
reviewing proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a
minimum use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by
the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes, which may have taken place in the course of time, are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship, which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building material shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the United States Secretary of
Interior Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design review
criteria with Council approval based on the Preservation District's predominant
architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/archeological
attributes.
(Ord. 17-2004. Passed 8-5-04.)
1325.05 TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building or zoning permit for an
alteration within the Preservation District, the permit application will be
deemed as an application to the Design Review Board. All property owners within
the Preservation District must receive Design Review Board approval prior to
building permit issuance.
(Ord. 17-2004. Passed 8-5-04.)
1325.06 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS, CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
    No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural
feature thereof in any designated Preservation District shall be undertaken
prior to obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Building
Department, and no Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued by the Building
Department for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of
any area, place, site, building, structure, object, or work of art within a
designated Preservation District unless the application for such permit is
approved by the Design Review Board through the issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness in the manner prescribed herein. (Ord. 17-2004. Passed 8-5-
04.)
1325.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District proposes
new construction or alteration to any portion of a structure within the
district he/she shall first apply for, through the Building Department, and
secure a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The
application for a Certificate shall be made with the Building Officer together
with such plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board
may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the Preservation District, and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five (45) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alterations, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object, or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Building Department of such
determination and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons for
denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)   Upon denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both. The first meeting between the Board and applicant shall be held within
thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is
accepted by both parties, the Board may henceforth issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (g)   In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listing property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meetings shall be held at least forty-five (45) days after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction,
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision to Council. Council may affirm or reverse the Board decision. If
Council affirms the decision, the denial of Certificate of Appropriateness will
stand.

company or companies, equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies shall transfer to the Fiscal Officer of the
Village from the insurance proceeds either:
      (2)   In the aggregate, two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000) and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or
      (3)   If at the time that such loss is agreed to, the named insured(s)
have submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or structure, the amount specified in the
estimate.
   (b)   Proof of payment by any insurance company or companies in compliance

damaged property has been negotiated.
   (e)   Upon receipt of insurance proceeds as authorized by this section, the

County Municipal Court, pay any applicable filing fee as set forth by the
Sandusky County Municipal Court and sent to the office of administrative
hearings by certified mail within 10 days of the date of the mailing of the
decision by the hearing examiner. The village officer or employee who issued
the notice of violation which gave rise to the request for review or a
supervisor to the issuing officer may file a written response to the request
for review. The response must be filed within 15 days of the receipt of the
request for review by the officer of administrative hearings. The Sandusky
County Municipal Court may set aside the decision of the hearing on finding
from review of the proceedings before the hearing examiner that the findings of
fact and conclusions of law are not supported by the record. The Sandusky
County Municipal Court may reduce a civil fine on a showing that the civil fine
would cause an undue hardship and that the underlying infraction has been cured
or is unlikely to reoccur. The Sandusky County Municipal Court may investigate
a claim that an infraction has been cured, make findings with respect to the
claim of cure, and include those findings within the record. The decision of
the Sandusky County Municipal Court may be appealed to the Sixth District Court
of Appeals in the same manner in form as any civil action filed with the
municipal court.
