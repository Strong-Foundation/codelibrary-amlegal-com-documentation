the action of Council, as was required to pass or adopt the matter.
      (8)   Motion to take from the table. A motion to take from the table
shall be in order when that order of business is being transacted and when the
matter to be taken up is laid upon the table, or under the heading of new
business and the motion shall be decided without debate, provided that the
mover may be permitted to state briefly his or her reason for the motion.
      (9)   Motion to postpone indefinitely. If a motion to postpone
indefinitely is carried, the principal question shall be declared lost.
      (10)   Motion for the previous question. The previous question shall be
in the form, “Shall the main question now be put?” It shall be admitted only
when demanded by two members; and until decided, shall preclude further debate
and all amendments and motions. If the previous question is demanded on
amendment, it shall apply only to the amendment. If the motion for the previous
question is carried, the question shall be put without further debate. However,
if the motion for the previous question is carried, but before it is actually
put on execution, the motion to which it is directed may be laid on the table.
      (11)   Motion to amend. A motion to amend is susceptible of but one
amendment thereof. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the
same form.
      (12)   Motion on question of privilege.
         (a)   Questions of privilege shall be: First, those affecting the
rights of Council collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its
proceedings; second, the rights, reputation, and conduct of the members of the
Council individually, and their capacity as such members.
         (b)   A question or privilege shall have precedent over all other
questions except a motion to adjourn.
      (13)   Majority defined. Whenever the term MAJORITY is used herein,
unless otherwise expressly indicated, it shall be held to mean a majority of
those elected to Council; likewise, whenever a “two-thirds” or “three-fourths
vote” is indicated it shall mean two-thirds or three-fourths of the members
elected to Council. Thus, in a Council of seven members, a majority shall be
four; a two-thirds majority shall be five; and a three-fourths majority shall
be six.
   (F)   Citizen participation.
      (1)   General. At each Council meeting, the agenda shall provide an

recording of the statements.
      (4)   Reserved time participation.
         (a)   Any speaker or group wishing to be on the Council agenda to make

85; Am. Ord. 96-08, passed 2-20-96)
Statutory reference:

§ 30.03 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS; OPEN MEETINGS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

      MEETING. Any prearranged discussion of the public business of the
Council, any committee thereof, or any board or commission, by a majority of
its members.
      NEWS MEDIA. Any newspaper or magazine of regular and general circulation
and any radio or television station.
   (B)   All meetings of Council, any committee thereof, and all boards and
commissions shall be open to the public except as otherwise provided with
respect to executive sessions. Executive sessions may be held only at regular
or special meetings for the sole purpose of the consideration of any of the
following matters:
      (1)   Unless the public employee, official, or licensee requests a public
hearing, to consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee, or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Council shall not hold an executive session for conduct related to the
performance of an elected official's duties or for his or her removal from
office.
      (2)   (a)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or
for the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. The provisions of this subsection shall not be used as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information that has not been disclosed to the
general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers to
prepare and submit offers.
         (b) If the minutes of the Council show that all meetings and
deliberations have been conducted in compliance with this section, any
instrument executed by or under the authority of the Council purporting to
convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title, or interest in any
public property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in
compliance with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona
fide purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the party is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the municipality concerning
disputes involving the municipality that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action.
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or
state statutes.
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   (C)   A resolution, rule, ordinance, or formal action of any kind is invalid
unless adopted in an open meeting of the Council, committee thereof, board or
commission. A resolution, rule, ordinance, or formal action adopted in an open
meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is
invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized
herein.
   (D)   Minutes of all meetings of the Council, a committee thereof, or a
board or commission shall be kept, promptly recorded, and open to the public.
Minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of discussions in
executive sessions authorized herein.
   (E)   Any person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled
meetings and the time, place, and purpose of all special meetings by contacting
the Director of Finance and Records who shall disclose such requested
information. In addition, any person may, upon request and payment of an annual
fee of not to exceed the actual cost thereof, receive reasonable advance
notification of all meetings of the Council, committees thereof, and all boards
and commissions at which any specific type of public business is to be

particular public body meetings for which notices shall be sent and shall
supply to the Director of Finance and Records sufficient self-addressed stamped
envelopes for the mailing of the notices as the Director of Finance and Records
may reasonably direct from time to time. In the event self-addressed stamped
envelopes are not provided to the Director of Finance and Records as directed,
or the annual fee is not paid, the Director of Finance and Records shall not
mail notices to the person.
   (F)   No special meeting of the Council, a committee thereof, or a board or
commission shall be held unless at least 24 hours advance notice has been given
to any news media that have requested notification, except in the event of an
emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an emergency,
the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the news media that have
requested notification immediately of the time, place, and purpose of the
meeting.
   (G)   Immediately upon any notice of meeting required by this section having
been given, the following certification shall be completed by the person giving
the notice and the certification shall be filed with the Director of Finance
and Records who shall maintain a record of these certifications:
   CERTIFICATION OF NOTICE

Statutory reference:
   Municipal Records Commission generally, see R.C. § 149.39
§ 33.16 ESTABLISHMENT; COMPOSITION; MEETINGS.
   A record commission hereinafter known as the Municipality of New Lebanon
Records Commission is established. The commission shall be composed of the
Chief Executive Officer or his or her appointed representative who shall serve

citizen to be appointed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Director of Finance
and Records shall serve as the Secretary of the Commission and as the

(Ord. 94-04, passed 4-5-94)
§ 33.17 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MUNICIPALITY .  Includes all officers, employees, or duly authorized
representatives or agents of the Village of New Lebanon.
   RECORDS .  Includes any document, device or item, regardless of physical
form or characteristic, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction
of any municipal office or a subdivision thereof, which serves to document the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other
activities of the office.
(Ord. 94-04, passed 4-5-94)
§ 33.18 COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH RULES.
   The Records Commission shall provide rules for retention and disposal of
records in the municipality and review applications for one time records
disposal and schedules of record retentions and disposition submitted by all
offices of the municipality. Records must be disposed of by the Commission
pursuant to the procedure set forth by the Commission.
(Ord. 94-04, passed 4-5-94)
§ 33.19 DISPOSAL OF RECORDS; APPROVAL OF STATE AUDITOR REQUIRED; REVIEW BY
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.
   All lists of records of the municipality which have been approved for
disposal shall be sent to the auditor of the state, who shall approve or

period of 60 days. Before public records are disposed of, the Commission shall
promptly notify the Ohio Historical Society which shall be given the
opportunity for a period of 60 days to select for custody any such public
records it considers to be of continuing historical value.
(Ord. 94-04, passed 4-5-94)
§ 33.20 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
   (A)   Upon request by any person and subject to division (H) of this
section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly
prepared and made available for inspection to the requester at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Subject to division (H) of this section,
upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public
records shall make copies of the requested public record available to the
requestor at cost and within a reasonable period of time. If a public record
contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection
or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for
the public record shall make available all of the information within the public
record that is not exempt. When making that public record available for public
inspection or copying that public record, the public office or the person
responsible for the public record shall notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of
a request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or
state law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.
   (B)   To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or the
person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public
records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying
in accordance with this section. A public office also shall have available a
copy of its current records retention schedule at a location readily available
to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under
this section such that the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested, the public office or the person responsible for the requested
public record may deny the request but shall provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary
course of the public office’s or person’s duties.
   (C)   If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public
office or the person responsible for the requested public record shall provide
the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation also shall be provided to the requester in writing. The explanation
shall not preclude the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record from relying upon additional reasons or legal authority
in defending an action commenced under R.C. § 149.43(C).
   (D)   Unless specifically required or authorized by state or federal law or
in accordance this section, no public office or person responsible for public
records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring
disclosure of the requester’s identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. Any requirement that the requester disclose the requester’s
identity or the intended use of the requested public record constitutes a
denial of the request.
   (E)   A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a
requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester’s identity,
and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do
so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not
mandatory and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester’s identity
or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or
intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public
office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate, or deliver
the public records sought by the requester.
   (F)   If any person requests a copy of a public record in accordance with
this section, the public office or person responsible for the public record may
require the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the copy
of the public record in accordance with the choice made by the requester under
this division. The public office or the person responsible for the public
record shall permit the requester to choose to have the public record
duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any other medium
upon which the public office or person responsible for the public record
determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the
normal operations of the public office or person responsible for the public
record. When the requester makes a choice under this division, the public
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide a copy of it
in accordance with the choice made by the requester. Nothing in this section
requires a public office or person responsible for the public record to allow
the requester of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public
record.
   (G)   (1)   Upon a request made in accordance with this section and subject
to division (F) of this section, a public office or person responsible for
public records shall transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission within a
reasonable period of time after receiving the request for the copy. The public
office or person responsible for the public record may require the person
making the request to pay in advance the cost of postage if the copy is
transmitted by United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in advance the costs
incurred for other supplies used in the mailing, delivery, or transmission.
      (2)   Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures that it will
follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period of time after receiving a
request, copies of public records by United States mail or by any other means
of delivery or transmission pursuant to division (G) of this section. A public
office that adopts a policy and procedures under division (G) of this section
shall comply with them in performing its duties under that division.
      (3)   In any policy and procedures adopted under division (G) of this
section:
         (a)   A public office may limit the number of records requested by a
person that the office will physically deliver by United States mail or by
another delivery service to ten per month, unless the person certifies to the
office in writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the
requested records, or the information contained in them, for commercial
purposes.
         (b)   A public office that chooses to provide some or all of its
public records on a web site that is fully accessible to and searchable by
members of the public at all times, other than during acts of God outside the
public office's control or maintenance, and that charges no fee to search,
access, download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, may
limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a person that the
office will deliver in a digital format, unless the requested records are not
provided on the web site and unless the person certifies to the office in
writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the requested
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes.
         (c)   For purposes of division (G) of this section, COMMERCIAL shall
be narrowly construed and does not include reporting or gathering news,
reporting or gathering information to assist citizen oversight or understanding
the operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational research.
   (H)   A public office or person responsible for public records is not
required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal
conviction or a juvenile adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any
public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning
what would be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request to inspect or to
obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is
subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who
imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or
the judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought in the
public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of
the person.
   (I)   (1)   Upon written request made and signed by a journalist, a public
office, or person responsible for public records, having custody of the records
of the agency employing a specified designated public service worker, as
defined in R.C. § 149.43, shall disclose to the journalist the address of the
actual personal residence of the designated public service worker and, if the
designated public service worker's spouse, former spouse or child is employed
by a public office, the name and address of the employer of the designated
public service worker's spouse, former spouse or child. The request shall
include the journalist's name and title and the name and address of the
journalist's employer and shall state that disclosure of the information sought
would be in the public interest.
      (2)   Division (I)(1) of this section also applies to journalist requests
for:
         (a)   Customer information maintained by a municipally owned or
operated public utility, other than social security numbers and any private
financial information such as credit reports, payment methods, credit card
numbers, and bank account information.
         (b)    Information about minors involved in a school vehicle accident
as provided in division R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(gg), other than personal
information as defined in R.C. § 149.45.
      (3)   As used in this division (I), JOURNALIST means a person engaged in,
connected with, or employed by any news medium, including a newspaper,
magazine, press association, news agency,  or wire service, a radio or
television station, or a similar medium, for the purpose of gathering,
processing, transmitting, compiling, editing, or disseminating information for
the general public.
   (J)   Upon a request made by a victim, victim's attorney, or victim's
representative, as that term is used in R.C. § 2930.02, a public office or
person responsible for public records shall transmit a copy of a depiction of
the victim as described in R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(ii) to the victim, victim's
attorney, or victim's representative.
   (K)   (1)   To ensure that all employees of public offices are appropriately
educated about a public office's obligations under this section, all elected
officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the
Attorney General as provided in R.C. § 109.43. A future official may satisfy
the requirements of this division by attending the training before taking
office, provided that the future official may not send a designee in the future
official's place.
      (2)   All public offices shall adopt a public records policy in
compliance with this section for responding to public records requests. In
adopting a public records policy under this division, a public office may
obtain guidance from the model public records policy developed and provided to
the public office by the Attorney General under R.C. § 109.43. Except as
otherwise provided in this section or R.C. § 149.43, the policy may not limit
the number of public records that the public office will make available to a
single person, may not limit the number of public records that it will make
available during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed period
of time before it will respond to a request for inspection or copying of public
records, unless that period is less than eight hours.
      (3)   The public office shall distribute the public records policy
adopted by the public office under this division (K) to the employee of the
public office who is the records custodian or records manager or otherwise has
custody of the records of that office. The public office shall require that
employee to acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. The
public office shall create a poster that describes its public records policy
and shall post the poster in a conspicuous place in the public office and in
all locations where the public office has branch offices. The public office may
post its public records policy on the internet web site of the public office if
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public office that has
established a manual or handbook of its general policies and procedures for all
employees of the public office shall include the public records policy of the
public office in the manual or handbook.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
§ 35.401 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.
   (A)   The village is an equal opportunity employer. Accordingly, the village
has and will continue to provide equal employment opportunity to all qualified
persons and reaffirms its commitment that there shall be no discrimination
against, or harassment of, applicants or employees because of race, color, sex,
religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other status
protected by local, state or federal law. The village will continue to recruit,
hire, promote, transfer, take corrective action and make all personnel
decisions, including those related to compensation and benefits, without regard
to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, and/or veteran
status, and in accordance with applicable law. Further, the village will make
reasonable accommodations for applicants and employees with known disabilities
who can perform the essential job functions with or without a reasonable
accommodation.
   (B)   Anyone who has a complaint of discrimination and/or harassment, or who
witnesses any discriminatory or harassing conduct, should report such conduct
immediately to his or her supervisor or the Municipal Manager. If the subject
of the report is the Municipal Manager, the conduct may be reported to the
Director of the Personnel Department or, if such duties are being handled by
the Municipal Manager, directly to the Mayor, Vice Mayor or Council Member. Any
official, manager, supervisor, or employee who violates the village's Equal
Employment Opportunity policy and/or the Sexual and Other Forms of Unlawful
Harassment policy, as outlined below in §
35.402, will be subject to discipline, up to and including immediate
termination of employment.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2006-03, passed 3-21-06; Am. Ord.
2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.402 SEXUAL AND OTHER FORMS OF UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   It is illegal for any village official, manager, supervisor or co-
worker to engage in unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Such behavior constitutes sexual
harassment when submission is made an implicit or explicit condition of
employment; when employment decisions are based on submission to or rejection
of such behavior; or when such behavior substantially interferes with work
performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
   (B)   The village can be held responsible for the behavior of its employees,
and also for non-employees, who engage in such inappropriate behavior on
municipal property. Thus, the village is committed to taking appropriate and
corrective remedial action whenever it becomes aware that harassment is taking
place or a complaint of harassment is made.
   (C)   Broadly speaking, sexual harassment includes “unwelcome behavior” such
as verbal, non-verbal or physical actions which are offensive in nature. This
may include, among other things, leering, staring, foul language, whistling,
gestures, sexual jokes, sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, touching with
hands, rubbing body against body, pinching, assault or any such thing that is
offensive to another person, including pictures or postings that can be
offensive.
   (D)   Anyone who has a complaint of sexual or other forms of unlawful
harassment, or who witnesses harassing conduct, should report such conduct
immediately to his or her immediate supervisor or the Municipal Manager. If the
subject of the report is the Municipal Manager, the conduct may be reported to
the Director of the Personnel Department or, if such duties are being handled
by the Municipal Manager, to the Mayor, Vice Mayor or Council Member. No person
making such a report in good faith will be subject to any reprisal or
retaliation by the village, and all such reports will be kept in confidence to
the greatest possible extent. The village will promptly investigate the
allegations and will take whatever action it deems appropriate to end any
conduct that the municipality deems to be unlawful and/or inconsistent with
this policy, up to and including immediate discharge. Likewise, persons who
make knowingly false reports of harassment will be subject to discipline, up to
and including termination.
   (E)   Sexually offensive behavior of any type is unprofessional and will not
be tolerated in the workplace or at any village-sponsored activity. This holds
true regardless of the genders of the individuals involved.
   (F)   Harassment based on other prohibited categories including race, color,
religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or any other status
protected by local, state or federal law will be treated the same as sexual
harassment for purposes of this policy.

§ 35.403 PERSONAL INTERACTION POLICY.
   (A)   While personal relationships among employees will sometimes develop,
the village discourages any employee from dating or becoming romantically
involved with a co-worker. In the event that a relationship should develop
between co-workers, all aspects of the relationship should be kept outside of
the workplace and all contact between the employees during working hours should
be maintained on a purely professional level. Personal relationships that in
any way interfere with an employee's work performance may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. In the
event that two co-workers become romantically involved, village management, at
its discretion, may elect to transfer one employee to another position and/or
department.
   (B)   Officials, managers, supervisors and other personnel in positions of
authority are prohibited from dating, or become intimately involved with, any
employee of the village who either directly or indirectly reports to them.
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment.

§ 35.404 EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION.
   It is the intent of the village to clarify the definitions of employment
classification so that employees understand their employment status and benefit
eligibility. Accordingly, the village defines regular full-time and part-time
employment as follows:
   (A)   REGULAR, FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES are those who are regularly scheduled to
work 40 hours or more per week, exclusive of lunch periods.
   (B)   REGULAR, PART-TIME EMPLOYEES are those who are regularly scheduled to

designated as either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT. According to federal and state wage
and hour laws, NONEXEMPT employees are entitled to overtime pay under the
specific provisions of federal and state laws. On the other hand, EXEMPT
employees are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and
hour laws, including overtime pay.

   (E)   Neither the Internet, the e-mail system, or village-issued cell phones
may be used to solicit for commercial ventures, religious or political causes,
outside organizations, or other non-job-related solicitations. Consistent with
the village's non-discrimination and non-harassment policies, the village will
not tolerate inappropriate uses of e-mail or other electronic systems. Thus,
all communications should avoid inappropriate topics or language that may be
perceived as threatening, slanderous, or harassing, such as racial/ethnic
slurs, sexual innuendoes, gender-specific comments, or comments that
offensively address someone's age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs,
national origin, or disability.
   (F)   Any questions concerning these restrictions should be directed to the
Municipal Manager. Violations of any of these guidelines may result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.

§ 35.409 PERSONAL APPEARANCE POLICY.
   All employees are required to maintain a clean, neat, professional
appearance on the job, including personal cleanliness, manner of dress, and
proper grooming consistent with the employee's work environment. Departments
requiring uniforms for specific employees shall establish their own dress
codes.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.410 ATTENDANCE.
   (A)   Attendance is very important to the smooth operations of the village.
The village expects all employees to be present and on time every day. We do
understand that, on occasion, an employee is sick or has other obligations that
may conflict with his or her work schedule. If possible, the employee must
discuss the conflicting obligations with his or her immediate supervisor in
advance. If the employee is ill, he or she must notify his or her immediate
supervisor as soon as possible before the employee's scheduled start time.
   (B)   Excessive absenteeism will not be tolerated. An employee absent
without approval is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. Absence without approval of longer than three days shall be deemed
a resignation.
   (C)   If an employee is abusing the Attendance Policy, the employee's
supervisor will discuss the problem with him or her. If the problem continues,
further corrective action, up to and including termination, may be taken.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.411 CORRECTIVE ACTION POLICY.
   (A)   All successful organizations have certain rules which employees are
expected to follow. Employees are expected to become acquainted with the
performance criteria for their particular job and with all rules, procedures
and standards of conduct established for each department and by the village, as
summarized in these Rules and Regulations. Further, employees' conduct away
from work must not adversely affect the village, its reputation, operational
success, or its relationship with its employees and/or residents and
businesses.
   (B)   If any employee does not fulfill the responsibilities set out by such
performance criteria, rules, procedures, and standards of conduct, he or she
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate
termination. Employees can be assured that the village will take corrective
action only when an investigation of the facts shows that it is justified.
   (C)   If any employee disagrees with a decision regarding corrective action,
a complaint procedure is available to you as outlined in §
35.802, the “Appeals and Grievances” policy of these Rules and Regulations.
   (D)   People work together best in an atmosphere where they are valued as
individuals and recognized as key members of a team. It is important that each
member of that team understand what is expected. It is impossible, however, to
write procedures covering every situation. Employees should make sure that they
understand what is expected of them, and make certain that they are clear about
what they can expect from the village.
   (E)   The following are examples of employee conduct that are not permitted
and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. This
list is given as a guide to all village employees, but it not intended to be
exhaustive.
      (1)   Conduct that the employee has previously been informed is
unacceptable;
      (2)   Failure to maintain satisfactory work performance standards;
      (3)   Violation of public law when at work on the premises or off the
premises when engaged in a work assignment;
      (4)   Falsification of time records, personnel records or other village
records;
      (5)   Smoking in village facilities, except in designated smoking areas;
      (6)   Violation of the village's Equal Employment Opportunity policy or
Sexual or Other Forms of Harassment policy;
      (7)   Violation of the village's Substance Abuse policy;
      (8)   Soliciting, collecting money, or circulating petitions on village
premises other than within the Rules and Regulations of the village;
      (9)   Possession of firearms, explosives, or other lethal weapons on
village premises;
      (10)   Abuse or waste of village tools, equipment, fixtures, property,
supplies or goods;
      (11)   Creating or contributing to hazardous, unhealthy or unsanitary
conditions;
      (12)   Violations of safety rules or acceptable safety practices;
      (13)   Failure to cooperate with an official, manager, supervisor or co-
worker, insubordination, or other disruptive conduct;
      (14)   Unprofessional conduct or use of abusive language on village
premises;
      (15)   Fighting, encouraging a fight, or threatening, attempting, or
causing injury to another person on or off the premises when engaged in a work
assignment;
      (16)   Sleeping on the job;
      (17)   Dishonesty or the unauthorized possession, removal, or use of
village or another employee's property, including records or confidential
information;
      (18)   Creating a condition hazardous to another person on village
premises;
      (19)   Destroying or defacing village property or records, or the
property of a village employee or resident;
      (20)   Refusal to follow instructions or to perform designated work, or
refusal to follow established rules and regulations;
      (21)   Unexcused absences and/or poor attendance;
      (22)   Violation of the village's Rules and Regulations.
   (F)   Should corrective discipline be required to improve an employee's
performance, the village may, depending on the circumstances, implement a
progressive disciplinary procedure. Such procedure may consist of a verbal
warning, written write-ups, suspension, and/or termination. The seriousness of
the problem will be the primary factor in determining the step on which an
employee enters the progressive disciplinary process. Other considerations,
such as the employee's past work record, may also be taken into account.
Failure of an employee to bring his or her performance to a completely
satisfactory level and to sustain this level of performance may result in
further disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.

§ 35.412 EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL.
   (A)   All employees will receive an annual performance appraisal.
Performance appraisals are designed to measure an employee's individual
contribution to the village. Employee performance will be measured based on how
well the employee meets the responsibilities of his or her job, primarily with
regard to the quality and quantity of work, dependability on the job, and
compatibility with fellow employees.
   (B)   The performance appraisal process is important because it may serve as
a basis for a salary increase and provides an opportunity to address an
employee's personal and professional growth and development, goals for desired
performance improvement, and any changes in job responsibilities or
expectations.
   (C)   An employee's immediate supervisor will tell him or her the basis upon
which the employee's performance will be evaluated, and is responsible for
evaluating the employee's performance in an informed, unbiased, objective and
carefully determined manner. Employees will have the opportunity to meet with
his or her immediate supervisor to review the results of the performance
appraisal. Following that meeting, employees will be offered an opportunity to
comment on his or her evaluation and asked to sign the evaluation.

§ 35.413 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   Employees are authorized to engage in outside employment where such
employment does not adversely affect or interfere with the performance of an
employee's municipal job. Each department head shall have the right to restrict
an employee from outside employment if he or she determines such outside work
is interfering with the employee's municipal job performance. Employees who
violate the department head's restrictions in this area shall be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

§ 35.414 CELLULAR DEVICE USAGE.
   (A)   The village may provide cellular telephones, electronic paging
devices, and wireless personal communications devices to employees in order to
improve productivity, enhance customer service to our citizens, and/or to
enhance public safety services. Those employees eligible for assignment of
wireless communication devices are designated by the Village Manager
commensurate to their job duties. The village maintains the right to access any
and all messages communicated through electronic means when village owned
equipment is used.
      (1)   Decisions regarding the use of village cellular telephones,
electronic paging devices, and wireless personal communications devices, which
are not explicitly stated herein, will be left to the discretion of the Village
Manager.
      (2)   Department heads are authorized to administer, provide guidance on,
and assure compliance with the features of this policy.
      (3)   Village owned cellular telephones, electronic paging devices, and
other wireless personal communications devices are intended for and expected to
be used for village business. Personal usage unrelated to work assignments is
permitted, as long as the personal use is reasonable, prudent, and minimal.
Under no circumstances shall village owned equipment be used to conduct
business not related to the village.
   (B)   Cellular devices, used appropriately, provide an opportunity to
improve productivity and improve the excellent level of customer service that
the village delivers. This is a guide for employees who by the nature of their
work, routinely use mobile communication devices in the performance of their
jobs.
   (C)   The Village Manager or department head shall have the right to revoke
an employee’s cellular telephones, electronic paging devices, and other
wireless personal communications devices provided to the employee by the
village for any reason up to and including if any inappropriate usage is
determined. Any inappropriate usage may be grounds for discipline, up to and
including termination.

application, authorizations for pay increases, promotions, disciplinary actions
of record, appraisals, and other matters that establish a complete personnel

immediately notify this office of changes in address, phone number, marital

Charter to be separate in their operation from all other municipal employees.
Therefore, in compliance with Charter § 2.18, neither Council nor its
committees shall in any manner take part in the discipline of, nor give orders
to, any subordinates and employees in the administrative service of the
municipality responsible to the Municipal Manager, but must deal directly with
the Municipal Manager. Council may inquire into the conduct of any office or
department or any affairs of the Municipality.

village provide health insurance to a person under federal age guidelines to be
covered by health insurance who is related to the spouse of the employee (said
spouse may or may not have shared but not sole legal custody of said person)
and who resides in the household of the employee, but does not meet the group
plan's definition of “dependent.” However, the employee shall agree, in advance
of the municipality providing said coverage, to reimburse the village for any
and all costs of said health insurance, through equal payroll deductions from
the employee's paycheck.
   (D)   Beginning January 1, 2015, the Municipality shall require an employee

opts out of all major medical, pharmaceutical, and dental coverage for the
employee, spouse and all eligible dependents, provided that the employee
demonstrates current coverage by the spouse for the employee, spouse and all
eligible dependents. Said payment may not be prorated. An employee may opt out
of health insurance coverage by the municipality at any time during the open
enrollment period or within 30 days of a qualifying event, as defined by and
pursuant to the policies of the village's health care provider. A qualifying
event may or may not include, but is not limited to, a change in family status
due to divorce, death, birth or adoption of a child, or the involuntary loss of
coverage on a spouse's health insurance. The village's health care provider

not be reimbursed if an employee qualifies for and receives a full scholarship.
However, should an employee qualify for a program which pays partial tuition,
the village will reimburse 50% of the tuition costs, subject to all other
provisions in this policy, of any amount over and above what the other program
might pay.
   (D)   Licensure testing. Licensure testing for any employee must be pre-
approved by the Municipal Manager. The cost of any licensure testing, required
for the employee to perform village duties, will be reimbursed by the village
at the rate of 100%, provided that the employee submits adequate proof of
successfully obtaining the license and proof of the payment. A request form
must be completed by the employee and signed by the employee's immediate
supervisor. The Municipal Manager must approve the request.

§ 35.602 VACATION/PERSONAL LEAVE.
   (A)   The village recognizes the need for employees to have a period of rest
and relaxation during the year. The village is also aware that at times
situations arise that are beyond an employee's control. Therefore, vacation/
personal leave is provided for all regular, full-time employees each year as
follows:
 
Full-Time Year(s) of Service Work Days
After 1 full year            10 days
5 to 9 years                 12 days
10 to 14 years               15 days
15 to 24 years               20 days
25 or more years             25 days
Note 1: For employees hired on or before January 1, 1970, the number of years
worked shall consist of both part-time and full-time service.
 
   (B)   All vacations/personal leaves are to be scheduled with the employee's
immediate supervisor or Municipal Manager as far in advance as possible.
Employers must pre-schedule their vacation hours not less than one calendar
week in advance for a full week of vacation, and not less than 24 hours in
advance for a single day or less of vacation. Consideration will be given to
seniority, rank, and the needs of the village when approving vacation/personal
leave requests. Vacation will be granted at the discretion of the department
head or Municipal Manager.
   (C)   Employees who have eligible vacation time may take short periods of
vacation time off, which is designated as incremental vacation hours (less than
a day), in increments of half an hour (30 minutes) or more.
   (D)   Vacation accrues on the anniversary of each employee's full- time
employment status with the village. No vacation may be taken until it is fully
accrued. Accrued vacation may be carried over to a subsequent year but may
accumulate only to an amount equal to one years accrual of vacation based on
service time. Any accumulated hours over this maximum will not be credited to
the employee and will be forfeited.
   (E)   Employees who are separated from the employ of the municipality for
whatever reason shall be entitled to be compensated for their accrued but
unused vacation time at their normal rate of pay at the time of such
separation.
   (F)   Employees may, with the approval of the department head and the
Municipal Manager, elect to receive a cash payment of 40 hours pay, in lieu of
40 vacation hours, no more than twice in any one calendar year, providing that
such employee has accrued at least ten work days.
   (G)   Employees with compensatory time may, with the approval of the
Municipal Manager, elect to receive a cash payment of up to 40 hours pay, in
lieu of 40 compensatory time, no more than twice in any one calendar year.

§ 35.603 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   The village provides for the accrual of sick leave in cases of genuine
illness or injury. Sick leave should be considered a privilege and not an
absolute right. Full-time and permanent part-time employees shall accrue sick
leave. Full-time employees shall accrue 1-1/4 sick days per month (up to 15 per
year). Part-time employees shall accrue one hour of sick leave for every 17-1/
3 hours worked2. Employees on layoff or leave of absence without pay shall not
accrue sick leave.
   (B)   Employees may use sick leave in minimum installments of half hour (30
minute) intervals for absences due to the following: (1) illness or injury of
the employee; (2) exposure of the employee to a serious contagious disease
which could jeopardize the health of the employee, co-workers or the public;
and (3) illness in the employee's immediate household requiring the employee's
presence.
   (C)   Each employee shall notify his or her immediate supervisor or the
Municipal Manager as soon as practically possible when it is known that
sickness will prevent the employee from working a scheduled shift. In no case
should such notice be given less than one-half hour after the start of the
shift. Failure to do so may result in absence without leave, and discipline up
to and including termination may be warranted.
   (D)   The village may require any employee absent from work due to illness
or injury in excess of three days to furnish a statement from a doctor clearing
employee for work. The village may also require an employee to submit to an
examination by a physician to verify the employee’s ability to return to work
based on position requirements.
   (E)   Full-time employees with at least five years of service who are
eligible for retirement from municipal service shall receive credit for sick
leave accrual according to the following restrictions:
      (1)   Each full-time employee who at the time of retirement from
municipal service has accrued to his or her credit at least 60 unused sick days
shall be paid for half the sick days accrued at time of retirement. Accrued
sick payout will not be more than 75 days of unused sick at the employee’s
current rate of pay.
      (2)   Part-time employees with at least five years of service who at the
time of retirement from municipal service have at least 60 sick days accrued
shall receive sick payout on the basis of one day of severance pay for each
three days of sick leave accumulated not to exceed 60 days of unused sick at
the employees current rate of pay.

§ 35.604 APPLICATION FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   Any employee who wants to go on a leave of absence must apply in writing to
the Municipal Manager and include all necessary information as to length of
absence, starting date, reason, and other pertinent details. This will
submitted to the employee's department head as early as possible prior to the
start of the requested leave. Employees requesting military, maternity,
personal, or educational leaves of absence are requested to submit an
application at least four weeks prior to the start of such leave. Required
municipal training, funeral leave, sickness, or non-job-related injuries
requiring absences of no more than 14 calendar days are not subject to these
guidelines for applications for leaves. Temporary and provisional part-time
employees, as well as probationary employees, are not eligible for any leave of
absence, unless otherwise required by law.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.605 INJURY LEAVE.
   Because all municipal employees are covered under the benefits provided by
the Bureau of Workers Compensation, payment for all approved medical and
surgical treatment, compensation for lost time, and other benefits will be
provided as determined by applicable state law.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.606 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT.
   (A)   The village will comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
(FMLA) as required by law. Thus, to the extent the FMLA applies, any employee
who has been employed by the village for at least 12 months and who has worked
at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months is eligible to receive up to a
total of 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave during a 12-month period.
   (B)   Eligible employees may request FMLA leave for any of the following
reasons:
      (1)   The birth of a child or the placement of a child with the employee
for adoption or foster care;
      (2)   A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to
perform the functions of the employee's job; or
      (3)   A serious health condition affecting the employee's spouse, child,
or parent, for which the employee is needed to provide care.
   (C)   Employees should direct any requests for FMLA leave to their
supervisor or to the Municipal Manager.
   (D)   As noted, FMLA entitles eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid,
job-protected leave in a 12-month period. The village calculates the 12-month
period on a rolling period measured backward from the date an employee uses any
FMLA leave. Thus, each time an employee requests FMLA leave, the employee's
leave entitlement would be any balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used
during the immediately preceding 12 months.
   (E)   Employees are required to provide at least 30 days notice of the need
for any foreseeable FMLA leave. When the need for leave is unforeseeable or due
to an emergency situation, notice is expected to be provided as soon as
practicable, which typically will be within one or two days of the time when
the need for leave becomes known.
   (F)   Employees are required to furnish medical certification of the serious
health condition that gives rise to their request for FMLA leave. Certification
forms are available from the Director of Finance and Records. Failure to
provide the required certification may delay the commencement of FMLA leave. If
circumstances change during the course of an FMLA leave, employees are required
to notify the village of such changes. Employees who are able to return to work
earlier than expected are asked to provide notice of such at least two days
prior to the new return-to-work date. Employees will be required to present a
fitness-for-duty certificate prior to being restored to their employment, and
an employee's return to work may be delayed until appropriate certification is
provided.
   (G)   The village requires that employees requesting FMLA leave substitute
any vacation/personal leave available for unpaid FMLA leave.
   (H)   While on FMLA-protected leave, an employee's health benefits will be
maintained under the same conditions as if he or she continued to work. This
means the employee will continue to be responsible for paying his or her
portion of health insurance premiums throughout the FMLA leave. If any portion
of the FMLA leave is paid leave, the employee's health insurance premiums will
be deducted from his or her paycheck as usual. However, whenever any portion of
these premiums cannot be deducted from an employee's paycheck, the employee
must deliver timely payments to the Company in the amount of such premium due.
If payment is not made timely, the employee's group health insurance may be
canceled, provided the village notifies the employee in writing at least 15
days before the date that health insurance coverage will lapse.
   (I)   If an employee does not return to work following FMLA leave for a
reason other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious heal
condition which would entitle the employee to FMLA leave, or other
circumstances beyond the employee's control, the employee may be required to
reimburse the village for its share of health insurance premiums paid on the
employee's behalf during his or her FMLA leave.
   (J)   At the conclusion of an employee's eligible FMLA leave, he or she will
be reinstated to the same job or to an equivalent job with the same pay,
benefits, and terms and conditions of employment.
   (K)   The village will continue to pay the premiums or any other benefits to
which an employee is normally entitled during the employee's FMLA leave.
However, when the employee returns from leave, he or she will be required to
reimburse the village for any such payments made on his or her behalf.

§ 35.607 MATERNITY AND OTHER MEDICAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   Maternity leaves of absence shall be treated in accordance with the
foregoing FMLA policy without regard to the eligibility rules provided herein.
Requests for other medical leaves of absence, when approved, will normally be
handled under the same procedures and policies. Employees requiring a maternity
or other medical leave of absence may also elect to utilize available sick
leave and then vacation/personal leave.

§ 35.608 JURY DUTY/SUBPOENAS.
   The village supports our employees' civic responsibilities and, accordingly,
encourages employees to accept jury duty if possible. Employees who are called
to jury duty, or called to serve as a witness under court subpoena, will be
paid what they would have earned at work on a straight-time basis for a period
of up to two weeks. The village will deduct any state jury duty compensation
paid to the employee from the employee's paycheck during that period. To
qualify for compensation, employees who are summoned or subpoenaed to court
must do the following: (1) notify his or her immediate supervisor in advance
and furnish proof of the requirement to appear in court; (2) report to the
designated court as requested; and (3) return to work promptly if the service
does not occupy the full day.

§ 35.609 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   (A)   The village provides all full-time employees with up to three
consecutive days off with pay in the event of a death in an employee's
immediate family. Employees may use up to five sick days in addition to the
paid bereavement. Employee may use vacation beyond that if needed. For the
purpose of this policy, IMMEDIATE FAMILY is defined as a spouse, mother,
father, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandparents, power-of-attorneys, or
other significant relationships as approved by Municipal Manager or department
head.
   (B)   Bereavement time will be given to all employees but will not be paid
time for temporary or part-time employees.

§ 35.610 MILITARY LEAVE.
   All regular, full-time employees who leave the village's employ to join the
active military forces of the United States during time of war or other
national emergency, or who is drafted into the military service at any time,
shall be granted a military leave without pay. Such leave will extend through a
date 90 days after he or she is released from service. Proof of service must be
filed with the Municipal Manager. Such employee shall be restored to the
position vacated or to a comparable position occupied at the time leave is
granted, provided that the employee submits an application to the Municipal
Manager within 90 days after release, and is physically and mentally capable of
performing the work of the former position. Failure of an employee to notify
the village of his or her intent to return to work within 90 days of release
shall be considered a resignation of employment.

INTEGRITY AND ETHICS
§ 35.701 CODE OF ETHICS.
   (A)   The sole objective of the village is to provide services or the
benefit of all citizens of the community. All employees must be aware of the
importance placed on them as employees and, being employed by a governmental
agency, must realize that they are bound to uphold the Constitution of the
United States, the Constitution and Code of the State of Ohio, the Charter of
the Municipality of New Lebanon, and all subsequent rules and regulations
established by the village. All employees are bound by the highest standards of
morality and should be concerned that their official functions as village
employees, as well as their private lives, should be conducted so as not to
reflect poorly on the village.
   (B)   Employees shall cooperate fully with other public officials and
employees and shall have no personal or financial interest which may interfere
or conflict with their function as village employees. No public official or
employee shall use or attempt to use his or her official position to secure any
valuable thing or valuable benefit for himself or herself that would not
ordinarily accrue to him or her in the performance of his or her official
duties, which thing or benefit is of such character as to manifest a
substantial and improper influence on him or her with regard to his or her job
duties. The Municipal
   Manager is authorized to require any village employee to disclose any
financial interest of the employee which may be in violation of the above-
stated provisions.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.702 PERSONAL CONDUCT.
   Employees' private lives are their own business. However, an employee's
personal behavior can have an impact on his or her status as employee. In any
given situation, the village will take into account the totality of the
circumstances in determining what action, if any, is appropriate. Any employee
who is arrested or indicted on felony charges may, for example, be placed on
suspension until the matter is resolved. Likewise, conviction of a felony or
any misdemeanor involving illegal drugs, immoral conduct, or acts of violence
may be deemed grounds for termination.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.703 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   Certain matters handled by village employees are of a confidential nature.
All employees whose job assignments and/or job environment give them access to
confidential information are prohibited from revealing this information except
to authorized village personnel. Uncertainty regarding the confidentiality of
particular information shall be reviewed with the department head. Violation of
this section is taken very seriously and may result in discipline, up to and
including immediate termination.

§ 35.704 POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
   Public employees, by nature of their employment, are restricted from
participating in certain political activities. Employees contemplating any
direct or indirect involvement with a political organization, campaign or issue
should review this policy, as well as ORS 124.57.
   (A)   Employees may not become actively involved in the campaigns for New
Lebanon Village Council.
      (1)   Political expressions such as posters, banners or buttons are
prohibited in village offices. Petitions for any cause may not be circulated on
village time or on village property.
      (2)   Employees may not use their position as a village official or
employee to support, endorse or campaign for any candidate.
      (3)   These provisions do not otherwise prevent an employee from
expressing political opinions, signing petitions, registering and voting,
making voluntary contributions to political parties or causes, supporting
issues or holding public office, to the extent such activity is not prohibited
by law.
   (B)   No employee may seek appointment or election to public office without
approval of the Municipal Manager but no employee shall be allowed to be an
elected official of the village and an employee of the municipality.
   (C)   Village employees shall not endorse any candidate for municipal
office. No employee shall make, solicit or receive any contribution to the
campaign funds of any candidate for municipal office, take part in the
political campaign of municipal office candidates, or participate in political
campaigns by any means whatsoever during work hours.

EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATIONS
§ 35.801 OPEN DOOR POLICY.
   It is recognized that complaints and grievances will arise from time to time
regarding various situations at the village. It is important that every
employee have an opportunity to ask his or her questions and to express
comments or dissatisfactions as a part of the communications in our
municipality. An employee who desires to raise a question or concern regarding
any aspect of his or her employment can approach any supervisor of his or her
choosing. However, in an effort to minimize confusion, employees are asked to
follow their chain of command, starting with their immediate supervisor, before
seeking out other managers for assistance. The Municipal Manager is always
available to respond to employee concerns or to help direct questions to
appropriate supervisors.
(Ord. 2005-13, passed 12-20-05; Am. Ord. 2019-06, passed 12-17-19)
§ 35.802 APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES.
   (A)   Any full or part-time permanent employee may, in response to a
personnel action, file an appeal in accordance with the following procedure:
      (1)   Step one. The aggrieved employee shall make an earnest and honest
effort to settle the differences and disputes with his or her immediate
supervisor without filing a written grievance. In the event that an agreement
cannot be reached, the subsequent steps may be taken with respect to the
grievance. Any grievance not initiated, taken to the next step, or answered
within the time limits specified herein will be considered settled on the basis
of the last answer provided by the village.
      (2)   Step two. A grievance relating to any matter involving a specific
event or personnel action must be initiated within seven calendar days of its
occurrence, not including the day of occurrence, after the employee has
knowledge of the facts which give rise to the grievance, or, with reasonable
diligence, should have acquired such knowledge. The aggrieved employee shall
present the grievance in writing to the department head. The grievance shall be
detailed, dated, and signed by the employee. The department head shall
investigate the matter and hold a grievance meeting within seven calendar days
after receipt of the grievance, not including the date of presentation of the
grievance. The department head will reply to the grievance in writing within
seven calendar days of the meeting. If not satisfied with his or her answer,
the employee may move to the third step of the grievance procedure, provided
this is done within five days of receipt of the written answer from the
department head.
      (3)   Step three. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved at step
two, the grievance may be appealed and presented along with all pertinent
correspondence to the Municipal Manager. He or she shall investigate the matter
and hold a hearing within five days of receipt of the grievance. If the
grievance is by a group of employees, he or she shall meet with no more than
three representatives of that group. The Municipal Manager will reply in
writing to the aggrieved employee within five days of the receipt of the
matter.
      (4)   Step four. If the matter is not resolved at step three, the
grievance may be appealed to the Personnel Appeals Board. All appeals must be
in writing, properly documented and dated, along with all appropriate
correspondence or evidence to date. It must be appealed within five days of
receipt of the matter.
   (B)   If the subject of the grievance is any subject other than a demotion,
a discharge, or a suspension in excess of 20 days, the Board is not required to
but, rather, may hold a hearing. If the Board so desires to hold a hearing, it
will be held within 20 working days from receipt of the appeal. Within ten days
of the hearing, the Board will issue its facts and findings and recommendations
to the Municipal Manager. The Municipal Manager shall have the right to accept,
reject, or modify the recommendations and his or her decision in this regard
shall be final.
   (C)   If the subject of the grievance is a demotion, a discharge, or a
suspension in excess of 20 working days, the Personnel Appeals Board shall hold
a hearing within ten working days of the appeal. Within ten working days after
the hearing, the Board will render a judgment with respect to the issues and
evidence presented. In this regard, the Personnel Appeals Board may uphold the
decision of the Municipal Manager, or restore the employee to his or her former
position without pay, or with any portion of the lost wages. This judgment of
the Personnel Appeals Board shall be final and shall be certified to the
Municipal Manager who shall enforce judgment.
   (D)   When a suspension, demotion, or dismissal is the action taken, the
action shall be deemed to have been taken by the Municipal Manager and the
aggrieved employee shall begin the grievance process at step three, as set
forth in division (A)(3) of this section.
   (E)   The Personnel Appeals Board shall determine the manner in which
hearings shall be conducted.
   (F)   Except in cases of grievances involving matters of related to a
specific incident or personnel action, any grievance which is not filed within
seven working days of its occurrence, not including the day of occurrence,
after the employee has knowledge or should have had knowledge of the facts
giving rise to the grievance, shall not be considered a grievance. Any matter
which is not timely processed by the aggrieved employee or employees shall not
be subject to further processing as a grievance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 36.01 SALE OF SURPLUS MUNICIPAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Personal property not needed for municipal purposes, the estimated
value of which is less than $1,000, may be sold by the Municipal Manager. If
the estimated value of the property exceeds $1,000, it shall be sold to the
highest and best bidder after advertisement for not less than two nor more than
four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the
municipality.
   (B)   When the Municipal Manager advertises for bids for the purchase of new
vehicles, equipment, or machinery for the municipality, he or she may include
in the specifications a notice of willingness to accept bids for the trade-in
of municipally-owned vehicles, equipment, or machinery which are obsolete,
unfit, or not needed for public use, and to have the amount of the bids
subtracted from the selling price as a means of determining the lowest and best
bid.
   (C)   When the Municipal Manager purchases replacement equipment or
machinery not subject to the competitive bidding provisions of the Charter, he
or she may offer to sell to the vendor the equipment or machinery to be
replaced and to have the amount of the sale subtracted from the selling price
as a means of determining the best value to the municipality, without regard to
the value limitations imposed by division (A) above.
   (D)   Real property.
      (1)   The Municipal Manager is authorized to take any necessary steps
appropriate for the sale of real estate owned by the municipality, said sales
to be ratified and approved by resolution of the Municipal Council.
      (2)   The sale of real estate owned by the municipality shall not require
any public advertisement unless specifically required by the Municipal Council.
      (3)   This division (D) of this section shall, when a parcel is sold and
Council approves the sale of the parcel, authorize the Municipal Manager to
execute and sign any deed or instrument of conveyance necessary to the
purchaser of the subject real estate subject to any terms or conditions as may

('80 Code, § 36.01) (Ord. 85-05, passed 2-5-85; Am. Ord. 2008-11, passed 8-5-
08)
§ 36.02 ASSESSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   The Municipal Council recognizes that the annexation of municipal
areas results in the municipality becoming responsible for the provision of
public works such as streets, curbs and sidewalks, storm and sanitary sewers,
water services and the like that may be non-existent or below minimum municipal
standards and that will require future replacement or improvement. The
replacement or provision of the above public improvements will require the
Council to, at times, assess those property owners who receive a benefit from
such improvements. The Council recognizes the financial burden that such
special assessments create on property owners and will strive to keep such
assessments to a minimum. However, the utilization of special assessments to
recoup the costs of public improvements benefitting newly annexed properties is
both equitable and necessary due to a majority of all existing village property
owners having personally absorbed similar costs of public improvements.
   (B)   In light of the above, the Council has established the following
general assessment policy and specific criteria for public improvements in
newly annexed areas.
      (1)   The municipal government will initiate no public improvement
project unless the public health, safety, or welfare necessitates such
improvement and/or a majority of the residents of an area petition or request
the Council to make such improvements.
      (2)   The municipality will make every reasonable effort to qualify any
contemplated public improvement project for county, state and federal
assistance. Applications for intergovernmental assistance for projects will be
determined by the Council on a priority basis after review of community needs
and project eligibility.
      (3)   That the portion of public improvement project costs not covered
through intergovernmental assistance will be distributed as follows:
         (a)   The municipality will pay all administrative and engineering
costs and the costs of improvements made on public property and all
intersections of public thoroughfares.
         (b)   The remaining public improvement costs will be prorated among
the property owners deriving benefit from such improvement and paid by special
assessment. The special assessment will be based either on a front footage
basis or by district depending upon which method is more appropriate for such
improvement. The question of whether or not to assess for public improvement,
the method of assessment and the amount and duration of the assessment will be
determined by the Council after the holding of public hearings for affected
property owners.
         (c)   In the case of front footage assessments, if the front property
footage exceeds 150 feet, the assessment shall be applied only to the developed
portion of the frontage or 150 feet, whichever is greater. The remainder of the
assessment shall be applied and be paid at the time the property is developed.
The exception to this policy is curb and sidewalk improvements on non-
agriculturally zoned property which will be fully assessed.
         (d)   In the case of assessment by district, the assessment shall be
applied based upon the percentage of use or general benefit derived by the
property owner from such improvement.
         (e)   In no case will a property owner's total assessment be greater
than 1/3 the value of the developed property.
      (4)   Any property owner receiving a special assessment will have the
option of paying for the assessment in its entirety, in one installment, or by
having the assessment paid through installments along with property taxes over
a period of time to be determined by the Council.

§ 36.03 SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT CRITERIA.
   (A)   Street and road maintenance and improvement. Street maintenance
(resurfacing, snow plowing and sweeping, curb, sidewalk and guard rail
maintenance) will be provided at no charge to residents. Street improvements
(reconstruction, widening, initial curbing or similar improvements involving
substantial capital investment) will normally be assessed on a front footage
basis. A typical street improvement project may include any or all of the
following: pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalk, local storm drains, and guard
rail. The maximum assessment upon residential proper shall be based upon a foot
street cross-section as specified in the municipality standard construction
drawings. If streets on both sides of a corner lot are improved, the shortest
side will be taken as the frontage for basement purposes.
   (B)   Curbs and sidewalks. The municipality will pay for the construction of
corner radii and the replacement of existing curbs. Property owners will be
assessed for the initial construction of curbs and sidewalks and replacement of
existing sidewalks, based on a front footage basis. Agriculturally zoned
property will receive a maximum assessment based upon 150-foot frontage with
the remainder assessed at the time of development.
   (C)   Storm sewer. These improvements will be assessed on a front footage
basis for specific benefit and/or by special district for general benefit
derived to the property from major drainage improvements, whichever is most
appropriate.
   (D)   Sanitary sewer. These improvements will be assessed on a front footage
basis to properties for specific benefit and/or by district for general benefit
for major sewers servicing the area. The shortest side of a corner lot will be
taken as the frontage for assessment purposes when utilities run along both
street rights-of-way.
   (E)   Water services. These improvements will be assessed on a front footage
basis. The shortest side of a corner lot will be taken as the frontage for
assessment purposes where water lines run along both street rights-of-way. The
maximum assessment to residential property shall be based upon an eight-inch
diameter pipe.
   (F)   Street lighting. There will be no assessment for street lighting which
will be paid for by the municipality.

§ 36.04 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Objective and guidelines. The following investment objectives will be
applied in the management of this public entity's fluids:
      (1)   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and
protection of principal while earning investment interest.
      (2)   In investing public funds, the Finance Director will strive to
achieve a fair and safe average rate of return on the investment portfolio over
the course of budgetary and economic cycles
taking into account state law, safety considerations and cash flow
requirements.
      (3)   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable
the Finance Director to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
      (4)   The investments portfolio should be diversified in order to avoid
incurring potential losses regarding individual securities which may not be
held to maturity, whether by erosion of market value or change in market
conditions.
      (5)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (6)   Bank account relationships will be managed in order to secure
adequate services while minimizing costs. Deposits should be concentrated in
single accounts except where audit control considerations dictate otherwise.
   (B)   Authorized financial institutions and dealers.
      (1)   U.S. Treasury and Agency securities purchased outright shall be
purchased only through financial institutions located within the state or
through “primary securities dealers” as designated by the Federal Reserve
Board.
      (2)   Repurchase Agreements shall be transacted only through banks
located within the state with which the Finance Director has signed a Master
Repurchase Agreement as required in R.C. Ch. 135.
      (3)   Certificates of Deposit shall be transacted through commercial
banks or savings and loans with FDIC or FSLIC coverage which are located within
the state and qualify as eligible financial institutions under R.C. Ch. 135;
and
      (4)   A list of authorized institutions and dealers shall be maintained
with the investing authority, additions and deletions to this list shall be
made when deemed in the best interest of the investing authority.
   (C)   Maturity. To the extent possible, the Finance Director will attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
to a specific cash flow requirement, the Finance Director will not directly
invest in securities maturing not more than five years form date of purchase.
   (D)   Derivatives. Investments in derivatives and in stripped principal or
interest obligations of eligible obligations are strictly prohibited. A
derivative means a financial instrument or contract or obligation whose value
or return is based upon or linked to another asset or index, or both, separate
from the financial instrument, contract, or obligation of a federal agency or
instrumentality or is created from both is considered a derivative instrument.
   (E)   Allowable investments. The Finance Director may invest in any
instrument or security authorized in R.C. Ch. 135 as amended. A copy of the
appropriate R.C. section will be kept with this policy.
   (F)   Collateral. All deposits shall be collateralized pursuant to R.C. Ch.
135.
   (G)   Reporting. The investing authority shall establish and maintain an
inventory of all obligations and securities acquired by the investing
authority. The inventory shall include the description of the security, type,
cost, par value, maturity date, settlement date, and coupon rate. The investing
authority shall produce a monthly portfolio report detailing the current
inventory of all obligations and securities, and all transactions during the
month, income received and investment expenses paid, and the names of any
person effecting transactions on behalf of the investment authority.
   (H)   Meetings.
      (1)   The Municipal Manager and Finance Director will meet at least once
every quarter to review the portfolio in terms of security, type, risk and
investment return. The Finance Director shall be responsible for maintaining
records of all investments and deposits and preparing reports that summarize
recent market conditions, economic conditions, economic developments, and
anticipated investments for the investment meeting.
      (2)   Pursuant to R.C. Ch. 135, all brokers, dealers, and financial
institutions initiating transactions with the investment authority by giving
advice or making investment policy, or executing transactions initiated by the
investment authority, must acknowledge their agreement to abide by the
investment policy's content.
      (3)   The Institution below by signing submits that it has read and
acknowledges the Investment Policy, and agrees to abide by its content.

a resident partner, owner, member, other beneficiary or distributee or owner of
a nonresident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the
municipality on which the tax was not paid by the entity.
      (5)   On the portion attributable to the municipality of the net profits
earned and accrued or received during the effective period of this chapter of
all corporations derived from sales made, work done, or services performed or
rendered and business or other activities conducted in the municipality,
whether or not the corporations have a place of business in the municipality.
      (6)   If a taxpayer's taxable income includes income against which the
taxpayer has taken a deduction for federal income tax purposes as reportable on
the taxpayer's form 2106, the amount of the deduction for federal income tax
purposes may be deducted from the municipality's income tax base.
      (7)   An individual taxpayer that has a net profit from a sole
proprietorship he or she conducts, the Schedule C actually filed for federal
purposes shall be filed by the taxpayer to determine his or her net income from
that proprietorship, as part of the municipal income tax return.

      (1)   In the taxation of income that is subject to the municipal income
tax, if the books and records of the taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the municipality disclose
with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that
part of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
municipality, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipality for purposes of the municipal income tax. In the
absence of such records, net profit from a business or profession conducted
both within and without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered
as having a taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of the municipal
income tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
         (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
municipality during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this division (1), real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer, and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid or accrued during
the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid or accrued during the same period to persons employed in the
business or profession, wherever their services are performed;
         (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   If the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an equitable
result, another basis may be substituted, under uniform regulations, so as to
produce an equitable result.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1) of this section, the phrase SALES MADE
IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF NEW LEBANON shall mean:
         (a)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
municipality regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the municipality;
         (b)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
municipality, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the municipality, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
municipality, and the sales result from this solicitation or promotion;
         (c)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place
within the municipality to purchasers outside the municipality, regardless of
where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, the taxable base shall be determined
in accordance with federal tax interpretations, when applicable, and with the
accounting method used by the taxpayer for federal income taxes, adjusted to
the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Director of Finance and
Records.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity within the
municipality constituting a portion only of its total business, the Director of
Finance and Records may require such additional information as he or she may
deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the
municipality. If the Director of Finance and Records finds net profits are not
properly allocated to the municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division, branch, factory,
office, laboratory, or activity or by some other method, he or she shall make
such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the municipality.
   (E)   Exceptions. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied on:
      (1)   The military pay or allowances of active members of the Armed
Forces of the United States and of members of their reserve components,
including the Ohio National Guard, or the income of religious, fraternal,
charitable, scientific, literary, or educational institutions to the extent
that this income is derived from tax exempt real estate, tax exempt tangible or
intangible property, or tax exempt activities.
      (2)   Poor relief, unemployment insurance benefits, old age pensions, or
similar payments including disability benefits received from local, state, or
federal governments or charitable, religious, or educational organizations.
      (3)   Proceeds of insurance paid by reason of the death of the insured,
pensions, disability benefits, annuities, or gratuities not in the nature of
compensation for services rendered, from whatever source derived.
      (4)   Receipts from seasonal or casual entertainment, amusements, sports
events, and health and welfare activities when they are conducted by bona fide

income of a decedent's estate during the period of administration (except such
income from the operation of a business).
      (7)   Salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation and net
profits, the taxation of which is prohibited by the United States Constitution
or any act of Congress limiting the power of the states or political
subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from interstate
commerce.

profits, the taxation of which is prohibited by the Constitution of the State
of Ohio, or any act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of the
municipality to impose net income taxes.
      (9)   Intangible income as defined by R.C. § 718.01(A)(4).
      (10)   On and after January 1, 2003, items excluded from federal gross
income pursuant to Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code.

the extent such distributive share would not be allocated or apportioned to
this state under R.C. § 5733.05(B)(1) or (2) if the S corporation were a
corporation subject to the taxes imposed under R.C. Chapter 5733.
      (13)   Employee compensation that is not “qualifying wages” as defined in
R.C. § 718.03.

§ 36.24 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   Each person as defined in §
36.21 who engages in business or other activity within the municipality, or is
domiciled within the municipality, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon,
make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year following the
effective date of this chapter, and on or before April 15 of each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or period different from
the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the end of
each fiscal year or period. The Director of Finance and Records is authorized
to provide by regulation that a generic return of an employer or employers,
showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer or employers from the
salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation of an employee, and paid by
him, her, or them, to the Director of Finance and Records, may be accepted as
the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to tax under
this chapter, is such salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation.
      (2)   Election to opt-in to state system. Certain taxpayers, net profit,
may elect to be subject to R.C. §§ 718.80 to 718.95 in lieu of the provisions
set forth in this subchapter, when eligible to do so under state statute. The
State Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to R.C. §§ 718.80 to
718.95 and any applicable provision of R.C. Chapter 5703.
      (3)   Limitations on the State Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this
subchapter shall be construed to make any section of this chapter, other than
this section, applicable to the Tax Commissioner’s administration of the city
income tax or to any taxpayer that has made election under R.C. § 718.80, nor
shall the State Tax Commissioner have any authority to administer any provision
of this chapter, except as set forth in this section.
   (B)   The return shall be filed with the Director of Finance and Records on
a form or forms furnished by, or obtainable on request from, the Director
setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions, and other
compensation received by him or her and gross income from business, profession,
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of the
gross income, earned during the preceding year and subject to the tax; only the
part of employee business expenses, job expenses, and certain miscellaneous
deductions that are reported on the federal income tax return 2106 form that
does not exceed 2% of the amount on form 1040, line 38, of the federal income
tax return; and

profits; and
      (3)   Other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Director may require.

the annual return on the request of the taxpayer if the taxpayer has requested
an extension for filing a federal income tax return. The taxpayer shall make
request by filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a federal filing
extension. The request for extension shall be filed not later that the last day
for filing the municipal income tax return as prescribed by ordinance. The
extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day of
the month following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax
return has been extended. The granting of an extension for filing an income tax
return does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless
the Director of Finance and Records grants an extension of that date.
   (D)   (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing,
pay to the Director the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided however,
that no payment shall be required if the balance due is less than $10. Credit
shall be allowed for:
         (a)   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of §
36.25; and
         (b)   Any portion of the tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of §
36.26.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in §
36.30, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
municipality is entitled under the provision of this chapter, may have the
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, if the overpayment is equal to or more
than $10, it shall be refunded.
   (E)   (1)   Amended returns. Where necessary, an amended return must be
filed in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or
claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations
contained in §
36.30. The amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Director. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment
of net profits after the due date for filing the original return without the
approval of the Director.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, the taxpayer shall
make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject to the
municipality based upon the final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon, or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (F)   Information returns, schedules, and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information, shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns. The failure to
file these information returns, schedules, and statements shall be deemed to be
a violation of this chapter. However, the taxpayer shall have ten days after
notification by the Director of Finance and Records, or his or her authorized
representative, to file the items required by this division.

§ 36.25 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer shall at the time of the payment of any salary,
wage, commission, or other compensation, deduct the tax of 1% on and after
January 1, 2016, of the gross salaries, wages, commissions, or other
compensation due by the employer to his or her employees who are subject to the
provisions of this chapter. In making the deductions at the time of payment,
the employer shall compute the tax to the nearest full cent so that mills of
five or more shall be increased to the next full cent and mills less than five
shall be dropped. No person shall be entitled to a refund merely because the
rounding off of the tax results in an apparent overpayment based on his or her
total earnings. Each employer shall, on or before the last day of each month,
make a return and pay to the Director of Finance and Records the tax withheld
during the preceding month. However, the Director shall have the authority to
approve the filing of returns and payment of the tax withheld on a quarterly
basis if the tax due for a single month is less than $200. In such case, the
employer shall, on or before the 15th day of each month following the calendar
quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, make a return
and pay to the Director the tax withheld during the preceding calendar quarter.
The approval for quarterly filings and payments may be withdrawn by the
Director when it is to the best interest of the municipality to do so. The
Director shall provide, by regulation, the manner in which the approval is to
be granted or withdrawn.
      (2)   The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not the tax has in fact been withheld.
   (B)   The employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold it until
payment is made by the employer to the municipality, as a Trustee for the
benefit of the municipality, and any tax collected by the employer for his or
her employees shall, until they are paid to the municipality, be deemed a trust
fund in the hands of the employer.
   (C)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about the person's residence, even though the residence is in the municipality,
but the employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   On or before January 31 of each year, beginning with the year 1974,
each employer shall file a withholding return in a form prescribed by and
obtainable on request from the Director, setting forth the names and addresses
of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the
preceding calendar year and the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and other information as may be required by the rules and regulations
adopted by the Director.
   (E)   Each employer, contractor, subcontractor, or business entity, either
resident or nonresident, shall file a return listing each subcontractor,
contractor, and laborer who has performed work within the taxable year and who
would not be listed on the return set forth in division (A)(1).
   (F)   For taxable years beginning after 2003, no municipal corporation shall
require any employer or any agent of any employer or any other payer, to
withhold tax with respect to any amount other than qualifying wages. Nothing in
this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than
qualifying wages.
   (G)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (H)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (I)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this section is not
subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.

subject to the tax imposed by § 36.22, shall file a declaration setting forth
the person's estimated taxable income, together with any estimated tax due
thereon, if any and if the estimated tax due exceeds $200 for the year.

be amended at any time.
      (3)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of the
following year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year, on or before the
date fixed by regulation of the Director, if it appears that the original
declaration made for the taxable year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
30% or more. At such time a payment, which together with prior payments is
sufficient to pay the taxpayer's entire estimated liability, shall be made. If
on the filing of the return required by § 36.24 it appears that the taxpayer
did not pay 70% of his or her tax liability, as shown on the return, on or
before January 15, or the date fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable,
the difference between 70% of the taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of

regulation, whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and
penalty provisions of §
36.29.

required to have been remitted on or before the 15th day of January.
   (F)   Any amount deducted and withheld for taxes from the compensation of an
individual shall be considered as estimated taxes paid in equal amounts on each
of the payment dates prescribed by division (B) of this section.
   (G)   Beginning January 1, 2003, taxpayers that are not individuals seeking
to remit a payment of estimated taxes shall remit such payments only as

current year shall be required to have been remitted on or before the fifteenth
day of December or, in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, the fifteenth day of
the twelfth month of the taxpayer's taxable year.

   (E)   The Director shall have the authority, when requested by the taxpayer
and for good cause shown, to extend the time of making and filing any return
whenever he or she deems it necessary to do so, but not to exceed a period of
six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the federal income tax return.
   (F)   When an application for deferred payment of tax due is filed by a
taxpayer, the Director may authorize partial payments of unpaid taxes when, in
his or her judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship conditions, to pay
the full amount of the tax when due and when, in his or her judgment, such
deferred payments are the best means of accomplishing the intent of this
chapter. However, the Director shall not authorize an extension of time for the
payment of taxes due for more than six months beyond the date of the filing of
the application.

ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM
§ 36.40 ESTABLISHMENT.
   The Municipal Council hereby authorizes the Board of County Commissioners of
Montgomery County, Ohio, to designate a portion of the municipality as an
Enterprise Zone as defined by the Ohio Enterprise Zone Act, R.C. §§ 5709.61 -
5709.69. The portion of the municipality so designated shall be as described in
Exhibit “A” attached to Ordinance 2000-27, passed August 15, 2000, and
incorporated herein by reference, and shall be coextensive with the
municipality’s corporate limits.
(Ord. 2000-27, passed 8-15-00)
§ 36.41 INCENTIVES.
   Upon certification by the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD) of the
municipality’s Enterprise Zone Program, the following incentives shall be
provided to businesses making eligible investments:
   (A)   Real and personal property tax incentives.  
      (1)   The municipality can grant real and/or personal property tax
exemptions within its certified Enterprise Zone of up to 75% of the value of
the eligible new investment of the project. Terms of these incentives can be
for up to 10 years. The municipality will decide the appropriate incentive
level and term based on a project-by-project evaluation of the associated costs
and benefits.
      (2)   The municipality may exceed the stated incentive cap regardless of
the term average if the New Lebanon Board of Education or Miami Valley Career
Technology Center approves the proposal. The municipality must formally request
that each school board review and consider such a proposal.
      (3)   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Act allows a local government to expand
the potential incentive to include existing taxable assets in two particular
situations:
         (a)   If a business plans to purchase and operate a large
manufacturing operation that has employed an average of 1,000 employees per
year during the past five years that has closed or has announced closure
proceedings, the municipality may grant an exemption to such purchasing
business of up to 100% of the value of the existing real and personal property
for up to 10 years.
         (b)    If a business agrees to remediate an environmentally
contaminated facility by expending at least 250% of the existing value of the
facility on a new investment project including at least 10% investment on
remediation activities, then the municipality can exempt up to 50% of the
existing real property and 100% of the new real and personal property
investment described as the project.
   (B)   State franchise tax incentives. A business is eligible for state
franchise tax benefits, in accordance with criteria established by the Ohio
Department of Development (ODOD), if it is in compliance with an existing local
Enterprise Zone Agreement, has created new jobs, and did not close or reduce
employment at any other Ohio location as a result of this project. The business
must file the appropriate State Franchise Tax application with ODOD between
January 1st and April 30th.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.42 BUSINESS ELIGIBILITY.
   Only those businesses that are qualified by financial responsibility and
business experience to create and preserve employee opportunities in the
Enterprise Zone and to improve the economic climate of the municipality may
apply for the available tax incentives. Furthermore, only businesses engaged in
manufacturing, light industrial, research and development, office or
distribution will be eligible to apply for tax incentives. No housing,
institutional, or retail uses may benefit from the Enterprise Zone Program.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.43 PROJECT ELIGIBILITY.
   (A)   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Act requires any business seeking an
incentive under the program to make a substantial investment. While R.C. §
5709.61 provides definitions of “substantial investment” under specific
circumstances, local jurisdictions have considerable flexibility to make
eligibility determinations. Projects must be determined to be eligible prior to
granting any tax exemption incentives through an Enterprise Zone Agreement.
Residential activities and retail projects are not eligible for Enterprise Zone
benefits.
   (B)   There are four possible eligibility determinations. For a project to
be considered for Enterprise Zone benefits, it must meet one of the following
four definitions:
      ESTABLISH. To set up a new facility at a location where the business had
not previously operated.
      EXPAND. To make expenditures to add land, buildings, machinery,
equipment, or other materials, except inventory, to a facility that equals at
least 10% of market value of the facility prior to such expenditures, as
determined for the purposes of local property taxation.
(R.C. § 5709.61(E))
      OCCUPY. To make expenditures to alter or repair a vacant facility equal
to at least 20% of the market value of the facility prior to such expenditures,
as determined for the purposes of local property taxation.
(R.C. § 5709.61(G))
      RENOVATE. To make expenditures to alter or repair a facility that equals
at least 50% of the market value of the facility prior to such expenditures, as
determined for the purposes of local property taxation.
(R.C. § 5709.61(F))
   (C)   Proposed Enterprise Zone projects that include the relocation of
employment positions or assets from one Ohio site to another are regulated
under Ohio law. The community considering the Proposed Agreement must provide a
minimum of thirty (30) days prior notice of the formal review meeting to the
community from which the employees or assets are to be relocated. In addition,
non-distressed based Enterprise Zones with authority under R.C. § 5709.632 or
Enterprise Zones certified prior to July 1, 1994 can consider a relocation
project if that project received a waiver from the ODOD Director under R.C. §
5709.633(B).
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.44 ASSET ELIGIBILITY.
   (A)   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Program can provide tax exemptions for a
portion of the value of new real and personal property. Existing land values
and existing building values are not eligible except as noted within the large
manufacturing facility or Brownfield site provisions. While the increased value
of land that is added by a business as a result of a project is eligible for
exemption consideration, the existing taxable value is not eligible for an
exemption.
   (B)   Categories of tangible personal property eligible for an Enterprise
Zone tax exemption include:
      (1)   New machinery and equipment purchased by the business;
      (2)   Used machinery and equipment purchased by the business from another
firm in Ohio which is not an affiliate and that was never used by the business
seeking exemption;
      (3)   Used machinery or equipment brought to the project site by the
business from a location outside Ohio and placed into service for the first
time in Ohio as a result of the project.
      (4)   Machinery and equipment owned by the business in Ohio, but never
previously placed into operation;
      (5)   Specified new inventory added as a result of an expansion at the
site in excess of the amount or value of inventory listed in the personal
property tax return of the business in the return for the tax year in which the
agreement is entered into; and
      (6)   New inventory added as a result of the establishment of a facility.
   (C)   The municipality, in considering granting personal property tax
exemptions, will review and adhere to R.C. § 5709.61(O), especially the “first-
used-in-business” standard that states “the property referred to has not been
used in business in this state by the enterprise that owns it, or by an
enterprise that is a related member or predecessor of such enterprise, other
than as inventory, prior to being used in business at a facility as the result
of a project.” Related members or predecessor enterprises are not eligible for
these incentives. Enterprise Zone Agreements within the property known as the
“New Lebanon Centre,” and as are covered by Section 4 of the “Shared Revenue
Agreement” between the municipality and Perry Township, are not eligible for
personal property tax exemption unless expressly agreed by the Perry Township
Board of Trustees.
   (D)   Each project will be unique in circumstances. The municipality will
gather as much detail on the proposed project as possible and apply the
standards set forth in the Ohio Enterprise Zone Act before making
determinations of eligibility or approving any incentives.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.45 MINIMUM PROJECT INVESTMENT, EMPLOYMENT AND COMPLETION CRITERIA.
   (A)   Proposed Enterprise Zone projects shall make an investment of at least
$250,000.
   (B)   The number of new full-time jobs to be created by each enterprise
shall be determined on a case by case basis. A new full-time employee means an
individual who is employed for consideration by an enterprise for at least 35
hours per week and is first employed by an enterprise at a facility that is a
project site after the enterprise enters an agreement.
   (C)   Documentation by the Enterprise of its efforts to hire personnel shall
consist of, but not be limited to, newspaper advertisements, employment
referrals from a JTPA Agency or the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, and job
applications received, reviewed and rejected.
   (D)   The proposed project shall be undertaken and completed within three
years of executing the Enterprise Zone Agreement. This includes the
establishment of a new facility, expansion, renovation, and/or occupancy of an
existing facility as well as completion of hiring new full-time employees.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.46 DUPLICATION OF PUBLIC BENEFITS.
   Businesses shall not be eligible to combine Enterprise Zone and Community
Reinvestment Area (CRA) benefits, should a CRA be created in the future.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.47 APPLICATION FEE.
   Each proposed agreement submitted by an enterprise to the municipality must
be accompanied by a one-time $500 application fee. This fee is payable through
check or money order made payable to the Ohio Department of Development. The
fee is to be submitted to ODOD with a copy of the finalized Enterprise Zone
Agreement between the municipality and the enterprise(s). Any Enterprise Zone
Agreement submitted without the required fee will be returned to the
municipality. Failure to comply with this provision will be reported to the
Ohio Department of Taxation. The application fee is subject to change, but must
follow the Administrative Rule procedure for review.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.48 MONITORING FEE.
   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Program requires each enterprise receiving a tax
incentive through an Enterprise Zone Agreement to pay an annual fee equal to
the greater of one percent of the dollar value of the incentive benefit
received or $500. The maximum annual monitoring fee will be $2,500. The fee is
to be made payable to the Village of New Lebanon. The fee is due annually for
each year the enterprise receives a tax benefit extended from the Enterprise
Zone Agreement. All such fees will be deposited in a special fund and used
exclusively for the purpose of administering and monitoring the Enterprise Zone
Program.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.49 NOTIFICATION.
   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Program requires specific affected entities to be
notified formally of a Proposed Enterprise Zone Agreement prior to a local
government reviewing and acting upon the proposal. Such notice is to instill
the fact that review of a tax incentive proposal is part of the local
government’s open meeting process and to provide affected entities with the
opportunity to comment on such proposals. Formal notice to affected school
boards and to communities from which a business will be relocating is required.
      (A)   School Board notice.
         (1)   The New Lebanon Board of Education or Miami Valley Career
Technology Center must be notified a minimum of fourteen days prior to the
Municipal Council reviewing and acting upon a tax incentive proposal in their
school district. The notice must be formal. The notice must include a copy of
the Proposed Agreement (application form). The notice must disclose the date,
time and location of each review meeting scheduled. Proposed Agreements, which
require both local and county legislative approvals, must provide formal notice
of each meeting.
         (2)   If the Board of Education comments on the proposal, either in
person or by written statement, the municipality and county when reviewing the
proposal must take the comments into consideration when determining the
appropriate action. Proposals which exceed the Ohio Enterprise Zone Act’s
maximum incentives of 75% must formally request the New Lebanon Board of
Education approval no less than 30 days prior to the date the Montgomery County
Commissioners plan to review and act upon the proposal. The notice must state
the percentage and term of the proposal and an estimate of the true value of
property to be exempted. The New Lebanon Board of Education must approve or
disapprove the proposal by formal resolution and forward a copy of the
resolution to the Municipality of New Lebanon and Montgomery County requesting
the action not less than 14 days prior to the scheduled Municipal Council
review. If the New Lebanon Board of Education does not take action to approve
or disapprove the proposal by the 14th day prior to the municipality and county
review, then the municipality and county can proceed as proposed.
         (3)   If an affected Board(s) of Education requests a meeting to
discuss the terms of any proposed Enterprise Zone Agreement, then a
representative of the local legislative authorities must meet in person with a
designated representative of the Board of Education within five business days,
unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
      (B)   Relocation notice.
         (1)   If the municipality receives a Proposed Enterprise Zone
Agreement from a business which intends to relocate all or a portion of its
operations to the municipality from another Ohio county or municipality and
intends to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with that business, then the
municipality must formally notify the legislative authority of the county or
municipality from which the business will relocate of the business’s reasons
for relocating. The notice must be given at least 30 days prior to the first
public meeting at which the agreement is to be deliberated by the municipality.
The notice shall be by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt
requested. In addition, the local government(s) considering the proposal shall
notify ODOD Director in the same manner.
         (2)   Upon request, the ODOD Director may reduce the notice period
from 30 days to not less than 15 days. The Director may approve such a request
if it is determined that earlier notice is not possible or likely would
jeopardize realization of the project. If a request for shortened notice is
made, then the municipality need not serve formal notice of the proposal to the
Director of Development.
         (3)   If the municipality fails to comply with the notice provisions
required, no Enterprise Zone agreement shall be finalized.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.50 GENERAL RELOCATION PROJECTS.
   (A)   The Ohio Enterprise Zone Act restricts the use of tax incentives for
projects that relocate all or a portion of an existing Ohio facility’s employee
positions or assets to another site. An Enterprise Zone certified under R.C. §
5709.632 can consider an intra-state project only if the ODOD Director issues a
waiver of the relocation provision according to R.C. § 5709.633(B). The
business and the municipality, when considering a relocation project, must
formally petition the ODOD Director requesting a waiver and providing
documentation that the waiver conditions are met. ODOD must respond to the
request within thirty days of receiving the petition.
   (B)   The specific conditions under which the ODOD Director can issue a
waiver are set forth at R.C. § 5709.633(B) and include:
      (1)   The business cannot physically expand at the current site to the
extent necessary for the proposed project.
      (2)   Market conditions such as just-in-time supply, changes in
production methods, changes in special contract provisions, or ownership
changes that require a relocation of the facility for it to remain viable.
      (3)   The business is subject to a consolidation of two or more existing
facilities and meets one of the following two standards:
         (a)   At least one of the facilities involved in the consolidation is
not an Ohio operation and the project would result in at least a 25% increase
in the existing Ohio employment and at least a 25% increase in the existing
value of the business’s real or personal property at the site.
         (b)   All of the facilities involved in the consolidation are located
in Ohio and the project would result in at least 25% increase in the existing
Ohio employment and at least a 50% increase in the existing values of real or
personal property of the Ohio facilities involved in the relocation.
(Res. 2000-41, passed 9-19-00)
§ 36.51 INCOME TAX REVENUE SHARING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All Enterprise Zone Agreements involving projects generating
$1,000,000 of new annual payroll located within the municipality require the
municipality to negotiate a compensation agreement with the New Lebanon Board
of Education or Miami Valley Career Technology Center. If agreement cannot be
reached within six months of the formal legislative approval of the Enterprise
Zone Agreement, then the Board of Education shall be compensated with 50% of
the income tax generated by the new employees, to be offset by any income tax
levied specifically by the New Lebanon Board of Education or Miami Valley
Career Technology Center.
   (B)   The mandatory 50/50 sharing is enforced only when the Board of
Education and the municipality cannot reach agreement. The mandatory 50/50
split is capped at the amount the Board of Education would have received had
the project property not been exempted. The revenue sharing provision is geared
to compensate the Board of Education for foregone revenues.
   (C)   Any revenue sharing agreement executed may include as a party the
owner of the real and/or personal property exempted under the agreement. The
owner may commit to provide cash, property or services by gift, loan or
otherwise.
   (D)   If the Board of Education and the municipality fail to reach an
agreement, then the 50/50 sharing payment is due on December 31 of that year
for or in which the exemption from taxation commences. The mandatory provision
is maintained for each subsequent tax year where the “new” annual payroll
exceeds $1,000,000 and the specified property remains exempted. A subsequent
agreement between the Board of Education and the municipality would supersede
the mandatory provision.
   (E)   The definition of “new employee” includes income tax revenues from
construction jobs and persons who are first employed at the site of such
property and who within the two previous years have not been subject to, prior
to being employed at this site, income taxation by the municipality on income
derived from employment for the person’s current employer. New employee does
not include any person who replaces a person who is not a new employee.
   (F)   The municipality and the Board of Education should devise a procedure
to verify income tax revenues eligible for the revenue sharing requirements.
Additional data collection and monitoring will be necessary. To avoid
verification problems, the procedure should be agreed to prior to any specific
project identification.

(Ord. 98-23, passed 6-16-98)
§ 37.03 CREDIT CARD USE POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to provide internal controls
and accurate accounting procedures with regards to the use of credit cards,
i.e. Gas America, Speedway, Master Card, Lowes, etc. while increasing
purchasing flexibility. Also, to ensure the Municipality of New Lebanon bears
no legal liability from inappropriate use of credit cards. The Municipality of
New Lebanon may make available the use of credit cards to employees with
purchasing responsibilities. Use of credit cards is considered a privilege and
is not a right for any employee of the Municipality of New Lebanon. This
privilege may be revoked for failure to adhere to any or all of the policy,
guidelines and/or instructions set forth below.
   (B)   Policy.
      (1)   It is the policy of the Municipality of New Lebanon to utilize its
established purchasing procedures via paper check and purchase order for normal
purchases.
      (2)   However, there may be situations where the preferred method of
payment is not the most effective. The Municipality of New Lebanon will allow
the use of the municipal credit card for the following reasons:
         (a)   When traveling on official village business;
         (b)   When a check form of payment is not accepted;
         (c)   When a check form of payment is not conducive to operational
efficiency; and
         (d)   When making online purchases for municipal business.
      (3)   The village credit card may NOT be used for the following reasons:
         (a)   Personal purchases of any kind;
         (b)   Personal cash advances through automated teller machines or
through a bank teller;
         (c)   Alcoholic beverages;
         (d)   Any product or service that is not considered "official
municipal business" or any use of municipal funds considered "inappropriate";
or
         (e)   Entertainment.
   (C)   Guidelines.
      (1)   This purchasing system provides for the policies and procedures for
control of the municipality's expenditures. These controls include the review
and approval of purchase requests by the Municipal Manager and/or Finance
Director.
      (2)   Each credit card will have a predetermined spending limit.
      (3)   Each person and/or vehicle that is issued a credit card (the
cardholder) will be responsible for maintaining spending under its spending
limit, within the monthly billing cycle.
      (4)   The Municipality of New Lebanon is a tax-free government entity.
Purchases should be obtained without tax, whenever possible. Tax exemption
forms may be obtained through the Finance Department/CFO.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   Credit cards will be issued from the Finance Department/CFO.
      (2)   When a credit card is needed to complete a purchase for municipal
business, the purchaser shall notify the Finance Department/CFO to acquire and
sign out the specific card. The Credit Card Log-In/Log Out Sheet must be
completed when a credit card is signed out as well as signed back in. The card
must be returned and signed in immediately following the use of the card.
      (3)   It is the card users responsibility to provide an itemized
transaction receipt from the vendor each time a credit card is used. Original
receipts will be matched to the credit card's monthly statement(s). Original
receipts must be turned in at the time the card is returned. The following
guidelines apply:
         (a)   Original receipts must be attached for all purchases of goods
and services regardless of cost. This includes charges for meals and goods.
         (b)   Receipts must be itemized detailing each item purchased. If a
tip was added to a meal purchase, the itemized and summary receipts must be
submitted.
         (c)   Missing receipts—the card user must attempt to get the receipt
from the vendor. If the receipt is not available, the card user must provide an
explanation for the transaction in writing for each missing receipt.
         (d)   If a telephone order is to be placed, please request a statement
or packing slip. This document will be turned in as your required "proof of
purchase".
      (4)   Credit card numbers are not to be stored on any websites for online
purchases, travel, etc.
      (5)   Credit cards cannot be used for IRS reportable payments for
services (i.e., independent contractor services for which a 1099 must be issued
for amounts totaling in excess of $600.)
      (6)   Credit cards may be used for vendors who are incorporated,
governmental or tax exempt and online purchases of goods or travel.
      (7)   Card users must comply with all municipal expense and travel
policies.
      (8)   For emergency situations, purchases will be processed as a Then and
Now procurement.
      (9)   The Finance Director/CFO or Municipal Manager shall annually report
to the Council all/any rewards received by the municipality for the use of the
credit cards.
   (E)   Disputes and returns.
      (1)   If items purchased with the credit card are found defective or the
repair or service is faulty, the card user will be the responsible party to
return those items, receive reparation or receive the credit for the purchase.
If the merchant refuses to replace or correct the faulty items, then the
purchase is considered to be "in dispute".
      (2)   All disputed items must be annotated by the card user and brought
to the attention of the Finance Department/CFO or Municipal Manager.
      (3)   The Finance Department/CFO must annotate all disputed items on the
monthly account billing statement.
   (F)   Lost or stolen cards.
      (1)   Should a credit card be lost or stolen, it is the responsibility of
the card user to immediately notify their Department Head and the Finance.
      (2)   Upon notification of a stolen card, the card user is required to
immediately file a police report. A copy of this police report is to be turned
in to the Finance Department/CFO.
      (3)   It is the responsibility of the card user to notify the Finance
Department/CFO within one working day of a lost or stolen credit card. Failure
to do so may be grounds for termination of card use and/or responsibility.
      (4)   Any suspicious use/activity of a credit card shall be reported
immediately to the Finance Department/CFO once noticed. Failure to do so may be
grounds for termination of card use and/or responsibility.
   (G)   Employee transfer and termination.
      (1)   Should a cardholding employee discontinue employment with the
Municipality of New Lebanon, they will be responsible for returning their
credit card to the Finance Department/CFO, prior to any last pay and/or
benefits being issued. The Finance Department/CFO shall review receipts and
reconcile the credit card before the employee's last day of employment with the
municipality.
      (2)   In the event an employee with access to credit card usage
terminates without returning the credit card, the Finance Director/CFO will
immediately terminate card benefits with the financial institution. The Finance
Director/CFO shall document such action on a memo. The original, signed memo
will go to the Municipal Manager for record. A copy shall be placed in the
employee's personnel file. The employee shall no longer have access to the
credit card on file with any business.
   (H)   Requests for credit cards or changes to existing cards.
      (1)   All requests for credit cardholders will be on an official memo and
go to the Municipal Manager.
      (2)   Any changes to existing credit cards will only be approved by the
Municipal Manager.
   (I)   Store credit cards.
      (1)   Store issued credit cards will follow the same procedures as bank
credit cards as listed above in divisions (A) through (H).
      (2)   Store accounts that do not utilize physical cards (i.e. Lowe's)
require a department head’s approval for an employee to be listed as an
authorized purchaser. Employees must contact the Finance Department/CFO to
obtain a purchase order before the purchase is made. Reconciliation will be
performed between the receipts, purchase orders, and store statements each
month.
   (J)   Annual inventory of credit cards. The Director of Finance and/or the
Municipal Manager may conduct an annual, physical inventory of all credit
cards. The date shall be at their discretion.
   (K)   Employee misuse. Any employee who knowingly misuses a municipal credit
card for purposes not authorized would be in violation of this policy as well
as R.C. § 2913.21. The employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to
and including termination as well as any actions directed by R.C. § 2913.21.
Employees are personally liable for unauthorized charges and any associated
fees. If, through no fault of the employee, the credit card is illegally
accessed and used by a third party, the employee will not be personally liable
for changes and fees directly resulting from the illegal access.

rents or charges are not paid when due, the Director or other official or body
may do either or both of the following:
   (A)   (1)   Certify them, together with any penalties, to the County
Auditor. The County Auditor shall place the certified amount on the real

if he also receives from the Director or other official or body additional
certification that the unpaid rents or charges have arisen pursuant to a
service contract made directly with an owner who occupies the property served.

the property served from the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes, except that, notwithstanding R.C.
§ 323.15, a County Treasurer shall accept a payment in such amount when
separately tendered as payment for the full amount of such unpaid water rents
or charges and associated penalties. The lien shall be released immediately
upon payment in full of the certified amount. Any amounts collected by the
County Treasurer under this division shall be immediately placed in the
distinct fund established by R.C. § 743.06.

owner, tenant, or other person who is liable to pay the rents or charges.

sold, any party to the sale or his agent may request the Director or other
official or body to read the meter at that property and to render within ten
days following the date on which the request is made, a final bill for all
outstanding rents and charges for water service. Such a request shall be made
at least 14 days prior to the transfer of the title of such property.
      (3)   At any time prior to a certification under division (A) of this
section, the Director or other official or body shall accept any partial
payment of unpaid water rents or charges, in the amount often dollars or more.

amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender's payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (B) of this section.
      (3)    If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code
listed in division (B)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was

Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by the authorized
local authority as to highways under its jurisdiction, except as otherwise
provided in this section. Where two or more state routes that are through
highways intersect and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or
yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the
Department, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the city, if they have a continuous length
of more than one mile between the limits of the street or highway or portion

is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 71.25 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNALS OVER INDIVIDUAL LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

§ 71.26 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian signals exhibiting the words “walk,” “don't
walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place, the
signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (E)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful

control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with R.C. §§ 4511.211 and
4511.432.
      (2)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

intended to protect it;
      (3)   Knowingly move, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper
with a manhole cover.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (A)(1) or (3) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree. If a violation of division (A)(1) or (3) of this section creates a risk
of physical harm to any person, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If a violation of division (A)(1) or (3) of this section causes
serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled by a
state or local authority, the offender is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted
under appropriate state law.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (A)(2) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within
one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or

   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

   (A)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless the
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and

R.C. § 4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law,
shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under division (D)(1)(a), (D)(1)(b), or (D)(1)(c) of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(D)(1)(a) of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (D)(1)(a) of this section and the assessment of points under division
(D)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (A) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (D)(1)(b) and (D)(1)(c) of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (A) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

not otherwise specified in division (D)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

   (D)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
72.56, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (D)(4)(b)1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,

the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (A) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the

sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         (b)   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (G) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in

any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege form the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited

specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (B) of this section.

5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (J)   If a person whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (K)   Division (A)(1)(j) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (L)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (A)(1)(j) of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the
same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the
same term as defined in R.C. §§ 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined in R.C.

advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary

person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting

give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically stat the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
   “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the

initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person

enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the

person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or

the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that

the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
72.561, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who

substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the

is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
72.55(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
72.561 or R.C. § 4511.194, regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or
is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the
person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be
held within five days of the persons’ arrest or the issuance of the citation to
him or her, subject to any continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. §

for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (B)(1)(c)1. through (B)(1)(c)3.
below shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combination thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on

lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (B)
(1)(a) and (B)(1)(c) of this section.
      (2)   Fifteen m.p.h. on all alleys within the municipal corporation.

   (B)   Whenever the Director of Transportation or local authorities determine
on the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that slow speeds on
any part of a controlled-access highway, expressway, or freeway consistently
impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic, the Director or such
local authority may declare a minimum speed limit below which no person shall
operate a motor vehicle, except when necessary for safe operation or in
compliance with the law. No minimum speed limit established hereunder shall be
less than 30 miles per hour, greater than 50 miles per hour, nor effective

      (2)   The Department of Transportation upon request from any local
authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of
any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if
it finds that such structure cannot with safety withstand traffic travelling at
the speed otherwise permissible under this Traffic Code, the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end

occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is accompanied by
the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian, or custodian.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of division (C)(1)(a) or

attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the holder’s parent
or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or
any public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular
travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months or the date the holder

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (F) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s

   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

the form of an endorsement, as determined by the registrar, upon a driver's or
commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver’s license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;

§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(C) or (D) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law

of determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (F)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (G)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat, or an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not

any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.

shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a

dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

§ 90.01 DOGS OR OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING AT LARGE; NUISANCE, DANGEROUS OR VICIOUS
DOGS; HEARINGS.
   (A)   Animals running at large. No person, who is the owner or keeper of
horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, swine, llamas, alpacas, or poultry,
shall permit them to run at large in the public road, highway, street, lane, or
alley, or upon unenclosed land, or cause the animals to be herded, kept, or

(R.C. § 951.02)
   (B)   Dogs running at large; dangerous dogs; debarked or surgically silenced
dangerous dogs.
      (1)   As used in this division (B), DANGEROUS DOG has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 955.11.
      (2)   No owner, keeper, or harborer of any female dog shall permit it to
go beyond the premises of the owner, keeper, or harborer at any time the dog is
in heat, unless the dog is properly in leash.
      (3)   Except when a dog is lawfully engaged in hunting and accompanied by
the owner, keeper, harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or
harborer of any dog shall fail at any time to do either of the following:
         (a)   Keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises
of the owner, keeper, or harborer by a leash, tether, adequate fence,
supervision, or secure enclosure to prevent escape;
         (b)   Keep the dog under the reasonable control of some person.
      (4)   Except when a dangerous dog is lawfully engaged in hunting or
training for the purpose of hunting and is accompanied by the owner, keeper,
harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper, or harborer of a dangerous
dog shall fail to do either of the following:
         (a)   While that dog is on the premises of the owner, keeper, or
harborer, securely confine it at all times in a locked pen that has a top,
locked fenced yard, or other locked enclosure that has a top;
         (b)   While the dog is off the premises of the owner, keeper, or
harborer, keep that dog on a chain-link leash or tether that is not more than
six feet in length and additionally do at least one of the following: keep the
dog in a locked pen that has a top, locked fenced yard, or other locked
enclosure that has a top; have the leash or tether controlled by a person who
is of suitable age and discretion or securely attach, tie, or affix the leash
or tether to the ground or a stationary object or fixture so that the dog is
adequately restrained and station a person in close enough proximity to that
dog so as to prevent it from causing injury to any person; or muzzle that dog.
      (5)   No person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or
more violations of division (B)(3) of this section involving the same dog and
no owner, keeper, or harborer of a dangerous dog shall fail to do the
following:
         (a)   Obtain liability insurance with an insurer authorized to write
liability insurance in this state providing coverage in each occurrence because
of damage or bodily injury to or death of a person caused by the dangerous dog
if so ordered by a court and provide proof of that liability insurance upon
request to any law enforcement officer, county dog warden, or public health
official charged with enforcing this section;
         (b)   Obtain a dangerous dog registration certificate from the County
Auditor pursuant to division (B)(9) of this section, affix a tag that
identifies the dog as a dangerous dog to the dog’s collar, and ensure that the
dog wears the collar and tag at all times;
         (c)   Notify the local dog warden immediately if any of the following
occurs:
            1.   The dog is loose or unconfined.
            2.   The dog bites a person, unless the dog is on the property of
the owner of the dog, and the person who is bitten is unlawfully trespassing or
committing a criminal act within the boundaries of that property.
            3.   The dog attacks another animal while the dog is off the
property of the owner of the dog.
         (d)   If the dog is sold, given to another person, or dies, notify the
County Auditor within ten days of the sale, transfer, or death.
      (6)   No person shall do any of the following:
         (a)   Debark or surgically silence a dog that the person knows or has
reason to believe is a dangerous dog;
         (b)   Possess a dangerous dog if the person knows or has reason to
believe that the dog has been debarked or surgically silenced;
         (c)   Falsely attest on a waiver form provided by the veterinarian
under division (B)(7) of this section that the person’s dog is not a dangerous
dog or otherwise provide false information on that written waiver form.
      (7)   Before a veterinarian debarks or surgically silences a dog, the
veterinarian may give the owner of the dog a written waiver form that attests
that the dog is not a dangerous dog. The written waiver form shall include all
of the following:
         (a)   The veterinarian’s license number and current business address;
         (b)   The number of the license of the dog if the dog is licensed;
         (c)   A reasonable description of the age, coloring, and gender of the
dog as well as any notable markings on the dog;
         (d)   The signature of the owner of the dog attesting that the owner’s
dog is not a dangerous dog;
         (e)   A statement that R.C. § 955.22(F) prohibits any person from
doing any of the following:
            1.   Debarking or surgically silencing a dog that the person knows
or has reason to believe is a dangerous dog;
            2.   Possessing a dangerous dog if the person knows or has reason
to believe that the dog has been debarked or surgically silenced;
            3.   Falsely attesting on a waiver form provided by the
veterinarian under division (G) of R.C. § 955.22 that the person’s dog is not a
dangerous dog or otherwise provide false information on that written waiver
form.
      (8)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of division
(B)(6) of this section that the veterinarian who is charged with the violation
obtained, prior to debarking or surgically silencing the dog, a written waiver
form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and that attests that
the dog is not a dangerous dog.
      (9)   (a)   The County Auditor shall issue a dangerous dog registration
certificate to a person who is the owner of a dog, who is 18 years of age or
older, and who provides the following to the County Auditor:
            1.   A fee of $50;
            2.   The person’s address, phone number, and other appropriate
means for the local dog warden or County Auditor to contact the person;
            3.   With respect to the person and the dog for which the
registration is sought, all of the following:
               a.   Either satisfactory evidence of the dog’s current rabies
vaccination or a statement from a licensed veterinarian that a rabies
vaccination is medically contraindicated for the dog;
               b.    Either satisfactory evidence of the fact that the dog has
been neutered or spayed or a statement from a licensed veterinarian that
neutering or spaying of the dog is medically contraindicated;
               c.   Satisfactory evidence of the fact that the person has
posted and will continue to post clearly visible signs at the person’s
residence warning both minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on
the property;
               d.   Satisfactory evidence of the fact that the dog has been
permanently identified by means of a microchip and the dog’s microchip number.
         (b)   Upon the issuance of a dangerous dog registration certificate to
the owner of a dog, the County Auditor shall provide the owner with a uniformly
designed tag that identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall
renew the certificate annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the
initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (B)(9)
(c)2. of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
         (c)   1.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.
            2.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within
another county, the owner shall do both of the following within ten days of
relocating to the new address:
               a.   Provide written notice of the new address and a copy of the
original dangerous dog registration certificate to the County Auditor of the
new county;
               b.   Provide written notice of the new address to the County
Auditor of the county where the owner previously resided.
         (d)   The owner of a dangerous dog shall present the dangerous dog
registration certificate upon being requested to do so by any law enforcement
officer, dog warden, or public health official charged with enforcing this
section.
(R.C. § 955.22) ('80 Code, § 90.01)
   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11,
and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to the dog
and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous
dog, and § 90.15 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog,
and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As
part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to
obtain the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

requirements specifically provided for by other provisions of the Codes of New
Lebanon, Ohio or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public
safety.
   (C)   Inspections. The Code Enforcement Administrator shall make all of the
required inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved
agencies or individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing
and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the
responsible individual. The Code Enforcement Administrator is authorized to
engage in such expert as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical
issues that arise, subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
   (D)   Right of entry. The Code Enforcement Administrator is authorized to

or another code or ordinance, the responsibility of more than one Code
Enforcement Administrator of the jurisdiction is involved, it shall be the duty
of the Code Enforcement Administrators involved to coordinate their inspections
and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the owners and
occupants of the premises shall not be subjected to visits by numerous
inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector from any
agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some provision
of the law, ordinance or code not within the inspector's authority to enforce,
the inspector shall report the findings to the Code Enforcement Administrator
having jurisdiction.
   (I)   Approval.
      (1)   Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved
in carrying out the provisions of this code, the Code Enforcement Administrator
shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided
the Code Enforcement Administrator shall first find that special individual
reason makes the strict letter of this code impractical and the modification is
in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code and that such
modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety requirements. The
details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the
department files.

the village with the general fund.
   (D)   Whenever any tree, plant or shrubbery or part thereof or weeds and
grass are growing in any street, public place, or upon private property

§ 96.14 MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (A)   No person shall store, place, or allow to remain, motor vehicles in an
inoperative condition, unregistered or unfit for further use, outside of a
fully enclosed garage or other suitable structure on any property within the
village limits.
      (1)   In the event of a violation of this section, the Village Manager or
his/her designee shall give notice to the owner, occupant, or person having
charge of the premises upon which the violation occurs. The issuance of such
notice shall be as set forth in § 94.14.
      (2)   If the person served with the notice as provided in division (1) of
this section fails to cause the violation to cease within five days of the date
upon which the notice was issued for a first offense, or 24-hours for a second
offense, or within 12-hours for any subsequent offense, by housing the vehicle
in a fully-enclosed garage or other suitable structure or by removing the
vehicle from the property, he/she shall be subject to the penalties provided in
§
96.99. The fact that the vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful
failure to comply with the notice.
      (3)   The Code Enforcement Administrator is hereby authorized to pursue
removal of the vehicle as follows:
         (a)   If a motor vehicle in an inoperable condition is located on
public property, the Code Enforcement Administrator may immediately remove or
cause the removal of the vehicle.
         (b)   1.   If a motor vehicle in an inoperable condition is located on
private property, the Code Enforcement Administrator may remove or cause the
removal of the vehicle not sooner than five days after serving notice as set
forth herein of its intention to remove or cause the removal of the vehicle.
            2.   All expenses incurred in removing or causing the removal of a
motor vehicle in inoperative condition shall be placed upon the tax duplicate
as a lien upon the land to be collected as other taxes and returned to the
village.
         (c)   The Code Enforcement Administrator shall forthwith notify the
registered vehicle owner of the fact of the removal and impounding, reasons
therefore, and the place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded
vehicle shall appear at the police department to furnish satisfactory evidence
of identity and ownership or right to possession. If the right to possession is
in question, it shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Prior
to issuance of a release form, the claimant owner, or operator shall either pay
the amount due for any fine for violations on account of which the vehicle was
impounded or as the court may require, post a bond in an amount set by the
court, to appear to answer to such violations. The pound operator shall release
each vehicle upon receipt of the release form and payment of all towage and
storage charges.
         (d)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the
place of storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of the
vehicle, which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of
storage by the owner or operator, shall constitute prima-facie evidence that it
was so removed by the owner or operator.
      (4)   No person shall store, place or allow to remain motor vehicles,
trailers, boats, recreational vehicles, etc. on any surface other than an
approved paved surface.

§ 96.16 RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (A)   Board of Zoning Appeals. In order to execute the purpose of this code,
shall create a Board of Zoning Appeals, which shall hereinafter be referred to
as "the Board," and said Board shall have the following duties:
      (1)   To decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any
interpretation, judgment, determination or decision made by the Code
Enforcement Administrator in the administration and enforcement of this
property maintenance code. Filing of an appeal shall give the petitioner
written notice thereof. At such hearing, the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to be heard and show cause why any item appearing on such notice
and order should be modified or withdrawn. The failure of the petitioner or
his/her representative to appear and state his case at such hearing shall have
the same effect as if no petitioner were filed.
      (2)   Findings. After a hearing, the Board shall sustain, modify, or
withdraw any items appearing on the notice and order by majority vote,
depending upon its findings as to whether the provisions of this chapter have
been complied with and the petitioner and the Code Enforcement Administrator
shall be notified in writing of such findings.
      (3)   Record. The proceedings of such hearing, including the findings and
decisions of the Board and reasons therefore shall be summarized and reduced to
writing and entered as a matter of public record in the office of the Code

same is not paid within 30 days after the mailing of the notice, then such
amount shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection the same as
other taxes and assessments are collected.
(Ord. 2019-02, passed 6-18-19)
§ 96.18 ABATEMENT PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In the event that the Code Enforcement Administrator determines that the
violation of the property maintenance code is so egregious as to constitute a
public nuisance as set forth in §
96.04 or §
96.05, the Code Enforcement Administrator shall proceed with action to abate
the public nuisance as follows:
   (A)   Determination and notice by Code Enforcement Administrator.  When the
Code Enforcement Administrator makes a determination that premises within the
municipality may constitute a nuisance or contain structural defects, he or she
shall determine which such problems should properly lie within the purview of
municipal ordinance and which within the purview of another authority, such as
the Dayton-Montgomery County Combined General Health District. When a remedy,
in the judgment of the Code Enforcement Administrator, is properly the
immediate concern of the municipality, he or she shall cause a notice of
violation to be sent to the owner of the property and those holding tenancy in
the property. The notice shall specify the conditions which constitute a public
nuisance, shall inform the property owners of their right to a public hearing
before the Municipal Council, shall specify a public hearing date before the
Council if nuisances are not abated within 14 days from the date of service of
notice, and shall inform the property owners of what action will be taken by
the municipality upon failure to abate the nuisance conditions.
   (B)   Requirement to abate nuisance.  Failure of the property owner or
tenant to abate the nuisance within 14 days of service of a notice of
violation, or to have worked out a schedule, satisfactory to the municipality,
for nuisance abatement or property repair, with sufficient surety to guarantee
completion on schedule, may be cause for the Code Enforcement Administrator to
seek a resolution by the Council that premises within the municipality are
being maintained contrary to one or more provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Abatement resolution by Council. A resolution may be adopted by
Municipal Council, which shall specify nuisances or structural defects on given
premises, and said resolution may require, within 30 days after resolution
passage, correction of the situation or conditions constituting a public
nuisance by persons having an interest in the specified property. This
resolution shall also specify anticipated actions to be taken by the
municipality in the absence of nuisance abatement. This Council resolution
shall require a report from the Code Enforcement Administrator upon or after 30
days from passage, such report to summarize the actions taken thus far to abate
specified nuisances. The resolution shall also solicit the property owner,
tenant, or other interested persons to show cause at a subsequently specified
public hearing at least 30 days hence, why additional action should not be
taken to abate the nuisances specified.
   (D)   Service of Council resolution notice. A copy of the Council resolution
specifying property nuisances shall be served upon the owner of the affected
premises, and may be served upon the person, or entity in charge of, or in
control of, such property whether as owner, lessee, agent, tenant, occupant or
entity having charge of the affected premises, either in person, or by being
mailed to or left at the usual place of residence of any such person or the
principal office of any such entity. If such owner, lessee, agent, tenant,
occupant or entity having charge of the land is a nonresident of the
municipality whose address is known, such notice shall be sent by registered or
certified mail. If no owner, lessee, agent, tenant, occupant or entity having
charge of the land is present on such land at the time of the attempt to serve
the written notice, or if the address of such owner is unknown, or if the
registered or certified mail is not delivered, it is sufficient to publish the
notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. A copy
of the Council resolution shall be posted on the premises if the property is
unoccupied.
   (E)   Public hearing. At the time of public hearing established at least 30
days hence by the Council resolution described by division (C) above, the
Council shall hear the testimony of all competent persons desiring to testify
respecting conditions constituting a nuisance, including, at the option of the
Council, cost estimate information for abatement and such other matters as may
be pertinent. At the conclusion of the public hearing, and after consideration
of the property status report prepared by the Code Enforcement Administrator,
the Council shall, by resolution, declare the findings.
   (F)   Action by municipality in lieu of compliance.
      (1)   A resolution by Council specifying nuisances and seeking abatement
will authorize action by the Municipal Manager, on behalf of the municipality,
in the absence of compliance by those having an interest named.
      (2)   Action by the Municipal Manager, personally or through his or her
agent, shall be in one of two ways:
         (a)   Through such legal or administrative channels as are deemed most
appropriate; or
         (b)   Through use of either municipal or private labor to effect the
necessary nuisance abatement.
      (3)   Immediate action by such municipal or private labor may be
authorized by a Council resolution passed after:
         (a)   The public hearing called for by division (C) above;
         (b)   A report from the Code Enforcement Administrator; and
         (c)   The expiration of 30 days from passage of the resolution
specified by division (C) above.
      (4)   The Council may grant any time schedule for nuisance abatement that
it feels represents a reasonable response to existing conditions.

received a compliance order or upon whom a notice of violation has been served
to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of such dwelling unit
or structure to another until the provisions of the compliance order or notice
of violation have been complied with or until such owner shall first furnish
the grantee, transferee, mortgage or lessee a true copy of any compliance order
or notice of violation issued by the Code Enforcement Administrator and shall
furnish the Code Enforcement Administrator a signed and notarized statement
from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee, or lessee acknowledging the receipt of
such compliance order or notice of violation and fully accepting the
responsibility without condition for making the corrections or repairs required
by such compliance order or notice of violation.

chapter, a notice of violation, or the compliance schedule established by the
Code Enforcement Officer, shall constitute a violation punishable as provided
in division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Any person who shall violate a provision of §§

offender a fine of $1,000 and assess a re-inspection fee of $25.
      (5)   If the owner of the property or person designated as the "offender"
fails to comply with the notice or order within the time prescribed and fails
to pay the assessed fines and re-inspection fees within 30 days after the
mailing of the bill for the fine and re-inspection fees, then such amount shall
be entered upon the tax duplicate and shall constitute a lien upon such lands
from the date of the entry and shall be collected as other taxes and returned
to the village's general fund.
   (C)   Any fines and/or re-inspection fees assessed upon an offender or
property owner, if not paid within 30 days of the notice of the charges
assessed shall be certified by the Council to the Montgomery County Auditor for
collection in the same manner as other taxes and assessments to be collected.

§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 of the Revised
Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed
or five years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced on issuance of
a warrant, summons, citation, or other process, unless reasonable diligence is
exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or concealed the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13) ('80 Code, § 130.06)
§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) below, a person is not guilty of an
offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) ('80 Code, § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for the element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for the element. When knowledge suffices to establish an
element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for the
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) ('80 Code, § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for
profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
   (B)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, tolerated,
commanded, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (C)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (D)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than a strict
liability offense, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent, or
employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the
offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not
available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section
defining the offense.
(R.C. § 2901.23) ('80 Code, § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in §
130.09, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by the organization if he or
she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and the duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) ('80 Code, § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Ch. 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a
misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. In
the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C. Ch. 3734,
other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a
felony punishable by a fine of not more than $25,000 or imprisonment for not
more than 18 months, or both, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An
attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an
offense under this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02) ('80 Code, § 130.11) (Am. Ord. 86-05, passed 2-4-86) Penalty,
see §
130.99
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.11.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) ('80 Code, § 130.12) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   A term of up to 180 days in an alternative residential facility
or a term in an alternative residential facility not to exceed the longest jail
term available for the offense, whichever is shorter. The court may specify the
level of security in the alternative residential facility that is needed for
the offender.
         (c)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender complete in
the center the entire term imposed.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(c) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative
residential facility, community alternative sentencing center, district
community alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender
will serve the residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in
charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender to be
examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including but
not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The person
in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential
facility, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place at which the offender will serve
the residential sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house,
alternative residential facility, community alternative sentencing center,
district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who refuses to
be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including but
not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious disease to be
tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

§ 131.41 VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. §§ 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §§ 2913.31 or 2913.43
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1),(B)(2) or (B)
(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,

         (b)   No more than five lots are involved after the original parcel
has been completely subdivided;
         (c)   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable
subdivision or zoning regulations;
         (d)   The property has been surveyed and a sketch and legal
description of the property is submitted with the application.
      (2)   If approval is given under these provisions, the Municipal Planning
Commission shall within seven working days after submission approve such
proposed division and, upon presentation of a conveyance for such parcel, shall
stamp “Approved by the Municipality of New Lebanon Planning Commission; no plat
required,” and the authorized representative of the Commission shall sign the
conveyance.
   (Z)   Acceptance of improvements. The village will not accept dedication of
required improvements, nor release nor reduce posted guarantees, until the
Municipal Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the subdivider's
engineer or surveyor has certified to the Municipal Engineer, through
submission of detailed “as built” survey plat of the subdivision, indicating
the location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the
Planning Commission or Municipal Engineer, that the layout of the line and
grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for
the subdivision and that a title insurance policy has been furnished to and
approved by the Law Director indicating that the improvements shall have been
completed, and are ready for dedication to the village and are free and clear
of any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation,
the Municipal Council shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication
in accordance with the established procedure.
   (AA)   Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy.
      (1)   Where a performance bond or other form of guarantee has been
required for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the
subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the improvements and
dedication of the improvements to the village, as required in the Planning
Commission's final approval of the subdivision plat, unless in the opinion of
the Planning Commission that the performance bonds or other form of guarantee
is adequate, and the partial or proportional construction of improvements is
sufficient to adequately serve the residents of subdivision for which the
certificates of occupancy are or will be sought, and the date for completion of
all improvements, existing and to be constructed, is acceptable to the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   No building permit shall be issued for the final 10% of lots in a
subdivision, or if 10% be less than two, for the final two lots of a
subdivision, until all public improvements required by the Planning Commission
for the plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the village.
   (BB)   Consumer protection legislation and conflict of interest statutes.
      (1)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be granted or
issued if a developer or his authorized agent shall have violated any federal,
state, or local law pertaining to consumer protection of real estate land
sales, promotion, or practices, or any applicable conflicts-of-interest
legislation with respect to the lot or parcel of land which is the subject of
the permit or certificate, until so ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
      (2)   With respect to such lot or parcel of land, in the event a building
permit or certificate of occupancy has been granted or issued, it shall be
subject to revocation by the village until so ordered otherwise by a court of
competent jurisdiction, provided that in no event shall the rights of
intervening innocent third parties in possession of a certificate of occupancy
be prejudiced by any such revocation.
      (3)   Any violation of a federal, state, or local consumer protection law
(including but not limited to The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970; the
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1970; the Interstate Land Sales in Full
Disclosure Act; the Truth in Lending Act; the Uniform Commercial Credit Code;
state “Blue Sky” laws; or stated subdivision disclosure acts) or conflicts-of-
interest statute, law, or ordinance shall be deemed a violation of these
regulations and subject to all the penalties and proceedings as set forth in §
151.99.
   (CC)   Performance bond release.
      (1)   The subdivider will be notified by the village six months prior to
the expiration date of the performance bond. With this notification, the
subdivider is requested to either obtain an extension of the bond if work is
not completed or request release, if improvements are completed. If the
subdivider does not request a release or a bond extension, the bond is
considered automatically extended until such time that the village obtains a
full settlement from the bonding company. Once all public improvements are
completed by the subdivider, two sets of “as-built” drawings must be submitted.
One set shall be in reproducible form on mylar. The developer must then request
release of bond. Inspection shall be made by the Municipal Engineer to assure
that all improvements are completed according to plans and specifications. If
not, a punch list indicating all deficiencies shall be sent to the subdivider.
The Municipal Council will release the performance bond when all improvements
are completed to the satisfaction of the village, the improvements are accepted
by the village, and a one-year maintenance bond has been properly posted.
      (2)   Until the performance bond is released, the subdivider is
responsible for the condition of all public improvements.
   (DD)   Release of the maintenance bond. If the improvements are maintained
in good condition for one year following the release of the performance bond,
the maintenance bond will be released. The village will notify the subdivider
three months prior to the maintenance bond expiration date and instruct him or
her to request release. Upon inspection by the Municipal Engineer, the
Municipal Council will release the maintenance bond and all obligations of the
subdivider will have been met.

151.99
§ 151.04 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   General statement.
      (1)   The regulations set forth below in divisions (B) through (V),
inclusive, shall control the manner in which streets, lots, and other elements
of a subdivision are arranged on the land. These design controls shall help
insure convenient and safe streets, creation of usable lots, provision of space
for public utilities, and reservation of land for recreational uses. The
planning of attractive, energy efficient and functional neighborhoods shall be
promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard growth.
      (2)   New subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of the
topography and features of the land; to economize on the construction of
drainage facilities; to minimize the destruction of trees, ground cover, and
topsoil; to preserve unusual rock formations, trees six inches or more in
diameter, sites having historical significance and such other such features
which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and
the community.
      (3)   The Municipal Planning Commission has the responsibility for
reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its design
development. The Commission shall insure that all of the requirements of
divisions of (B) through (V) inclusive, below, are met.
   (B)   Conformity to development plans and zoning. The arrangement,
character, width, and location of all arterial and collector thoroughfares or
extensions thereof shall conform with the village's major thoroughfare plan.
Thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned plan shall conform to the
recommendation of the Municipal Planning Commission based upon the design
standards set forth in divisions (C) to (M) inclusive, below. In addition, no
final plat of land within the area in which an existing zoning ordinance is in
effect shall be approved unless it conforms with such an ordinance.
   (C)   Suitability of land. If the Municipal Planning Commission finds that
the land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development
due to flooding; bad drainage; topography; high ground water; inadequate water
supply, schools, transportation facilities; or other such conditions which may
endanger health, life, or property; or, if from investigations conducted by the
public agencies concerned, it is determined that in the best interest of the
public that the land should not be developed for the purposes, the Commission
shall not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced
by the subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the
development of the land.
   (D)   Street design. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade
construction, and location of all streets shall conform to the major
thoroughfare plan of the village, or subsequent amendments thereto, and shall
be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, and public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The
street pattern shall discourage through traffic on the interior of a
subdivision. The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the major thoroughfare plan.
Subdivisions which adjoin or include existing streets which do not conform to
required street widths shall be required to dedicate additional right-of-way
along either or both sides of such street, and shall construct such
improvements as are necessary to bring such street up to the standards
specified in these regulations.
   (E)   Street design standards for cul-de-sacs. All cul-de-sacs shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the standards specified herein at
Table 1 for local (low volume) streets. No cul-de-sac shall be greater than 800
feet in length. The minimum cul-de-sac right-of-way radius shall be 50 feet.
The minimum cul-de-sac pavement radius shall be 40 feet. The Planning
Commission may required additional right-of-way for installation of utilities.
   (F)   Street design standards for loop type streets. The design and
improvement standards contained herein at Table 1 for local (low volume)
streets are the suggested minimums for all local loop type streets. In the case
of commercial and industrial subdivisions, the Planning Commission may require
greater pavement and right-of-way widths. The Planning Commission may require
additional right-of-way for installation of utilities.
   (G)   Street design standards for local, collector, and arterial streets.
The design and improvement standards contained in the following table are
required minimums for all local, collector, and arterial streets. All such
streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards
specified herein at Table 1.
   (H)   Horizontal alignment. When there is an angle of deflection of more
than 10° between two centerline tangent sections of a street, a curve of
adequate radius shall connect them. Between reverse curves, a minimum tangent
of 100 feet shall be introduced.
   (I)   Vertical alignment. Vertical curves and minimum vertical visibility
shall conform to the Ohio Department of Transportation's Location and Design
Manual, Volume 1, Roadway Design, dated December, 1990, or latest revision
thereof.

Notes:
      1.   Whenever a public thoroughfare which does not permit on-street
parking has been approved, the Village Council shall adopt a no on-street
parking ordinance specific to such thoroughfare.
      2.   The Planning Commission shall reserve the right to require sidewalks
on only one side of a street and to modify the sidewalk width requirements if
necessary.
      3.   Additional right-of-way may be required for utility easements.
      4.   The village reserves the right to deviate from the above recommended
street standards when appropriate, specific data warrants deviation.
 
   (J)   Intersection design standards.
      (1)   The design and improvement standards for intersections are
suggested minimums for all street intersections in subdivisions. All such
intersections shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
standards as specified herein at Table 2, below.
      (2)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two streets
shall be avoided.
      (3)   Four-way intersections of local streets should be avoided and
three-way or T intersections should be encouraged wherever possible.

   (D)   Collector, marginal access - arterial 1,320 - all cases
 
   (K)   Special street types. The following requirements shall apply to
special street types:
      (1)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-
end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan, and
only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design is
provided, and provisions for maintenance and removal are advanced. Temporary
dead-end streets longer than 200 feet shall not be permitted.
      (2)   Dedication on new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
      (3)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street shall be designed, if the subdivision design is such that residential
lots would require direct vehicular access onto the arterial highway. Points of
access to the arterial street shall be spaced a minimum of 1,320 feet. A
planting strip having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be provided between the
pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access right-
of-way which shall be 50 feet.
      (4)   Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions, except
where justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in commercial and
industrial districts if other provisions cannot be made for adequate service
access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be 20 feet for the right-of-way and
20 feet for the pavement width. Alleys shall have two points of access from one
or more streets and traffic flow shall be in one direction.
   (L)   Streets for commercial subdivisions. Streets serving business
developments and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local streets. The
intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible interference with
traffic movement on the streets, and shall be located not less than 100 feet
from the intersection of an arterial or collector street with any other street,
and shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each other. The Commission may
require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.
   (M)   Streets for industrial subdivisions. Collector streets for industrial
subdivisions shall be planned to serve industrial areas exclusively and shall
connect with arterial streets so that no industrial traffic will be directed
into any residential streets. The intersections of service streets from parking
areas with arterial or collector streets shall not be less than 100 feet from
the intersection of the arterial or collector street with any other street.
Streets shall be planned to be extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land
planned for industry, except for severe physical conditions or if the
Commission finds such extension is not in accord with the approved plan of the
area.
   (N)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of the street in all
residential subdivisions.
      (2)   All sidewalks shall have curb cuts and ramps to street grade
suitable for use by wheelchairs at the intersection of any sidewalk or walkway
with a thoroughfare.
      (3)   Public sidewalks shall be required for all commercial lots.
      (4)   Public sidewalks may be required for industrial lots, subject to
the approval of the Municipal Planning Commission.
   (O)   Blocks. The following regulations shall govern the design and layout
of blocks:
      (1)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in divisions (D) to (N), inclusive, and shall be
arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the size and character
required for the district as set forth in these subdivision regulations or the
Zoning Code and to provide for the required community facilities.
      (2)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds may be approved by
the Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance of
interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
      (3)   No block shall be longer than 1,500 feet and the block width shall
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where unusual topography or other
exceptional physical circumstances exist.
      (4)   Where blocks are over 900 feet in length a crosswalk easement not
less than 10 feet in width at or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary, to provide proper access to schools, recreational areas, shopping
centers, and other facilities.
   (P)   Lots. The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of
lots.
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding developments.
      (2)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
subdivision regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district
in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
      (3)   Each lot shall front on a public street. The minimum lot sizes,
widths, and setbacks shall be specified in the Zoning Code, Chapter 152.
      (4)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where the Commission determines that a
variation to this rule would provide a better layout.
      (5)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the
Commission determines that it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
      (6)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
75 feet and shall conform to §
152.177 of the zoning code.
      (7)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three times
its average width, nor shall it have a depth of less than 120 feet except that
whenever a lot fronts upon an exterior curved portion of a street, the
centerline radius of which is 100 feet or less, then the required minimum lot
depth may be reduced to not less than 100 feet.
   (Q)   Access control. The following shall further regulate proposed
development. The Planning Commission shall limit access in the following
manner:
      (1)   A maximum of one curb cut shall be permitted for each lot having
frontage of 199 feet or less. The Commission reserves the right to permit two
one-way curb cuts with one-way driveways in lieu of one curb cut with two-way
traffic.
      (2)   A maximum of two curb cuts shall be permitted for those non-
residential lots having frontage of 200 feet or more.
      (3)   No curb cut shall be permitted to be located within 100 feet (50
feet for residential lots) of a street intersection. However, the Planning
Commission shall reserve the right, in certain instances, to require that such
a distance be increased to a maximum of 200 feet.
      (4)   The minimum distance permitted between curb cuts on adjoining non-
residential lots shall not be less than 100 feet unless otherwise authorized by
the Planning Commission.
      (5)   No residential, commercial, or industrial use shall be permitted to
create a continuous curb cut or driveway along its property line.
   (R)   Large private parking lots. Where a parking lot is proposed to consist
of 50 or more spaces, it shall include, as a minimum, one decorative or
ornamental tree for every 10 parking spaces to be provided. Such plantings may
be placed either within the required setback area or the interior parking lot
or both. Whenever 100 or more parking spaces will be provided, at least ½ of
the required number of trees shall be placed within the interior of the parking
lot. Regardless of parking lot size, the number of trees required may be
planted in clusters, or may be planted in evenly spaced or staggered rows.
   (S)   Easements. Easements of at least 20 feet in width centered along rear
or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary for sanitary sewers, gas
mains, water lines, and electric lines. Easements shall also be provided along
every water course, storm sewer, drainage channel, or stream within a
subdivision, as provided for herein at division (T) of these regulations.
   (T)   Flood areas, areas of high ground water, and storm drain ditches.
      (1)   In order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
people, the Municipal Planning Commission shall reject any proposed subdivision
located in an area subject to periodic flooding or having high ground water
problems. If the proposed subdivision is located in an area known to have poor
drainage, high ground water problems, or other adverse physical
characteristics, the Commission may approve the subdivision provided the
subdivider agrees to perform such improvements as will render the area safe for
the intended use. In lieu of improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a
surety or certified check covering the cost of required improvements.
      (2)   Flood control, ground water control, or storm drainage facilities
shall be provided as follows:
         (a)   Access to flood control, ground water control, or storm drainage
ditches and channels shall be by means of easements. Such easements shall not
be less than 30 feet in width, exclusive of the width of the ditch, or channel,
and an easement of this type shall be provided on one side of a flood control,
ground water control, or storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar type
facility;
         (b)   Flood control, ground water control, or storm drainage easements
containing underground facilities shall have a minimum width of 15 feet;
         (c)   Whenever a flood control, ground water control, or storm
drainage ditch or channel has a depth of five feet or more, or a bank slope of
two feet horizontal to one foot vertical or steeper, a five-foot high masonry
wall or a five-foot high chain link fence may be required by the Commission.
   (U)   Public sites, open space, and natural features.
      (1)   Where a park, playground, school, or public access to water
frontage which is shown in the comprehensive development plan is located in
whole or in part in the proposed subdivision, the Commission shall request the
dedication of such area within the subdivision. The subdivider shall pay for
only that portion of the cost of the public site that benefits his or her
subdivision as determined by the Commission. Every subdivider of land for
subdivisions not containing public sites shall be requested to provide land or
payment in lieu thereof for that portion of benefits from public sites accruing
his or her land as determined by the Commission. The Commission shall wherever
possible, establish the preservation of all natural features which add value to
residential developments and to the community, such as large wooded areas,
water courses, beaches, areas of historical significance, and similar
irreplaceable assets.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall require the dedication of 5% of the
gross area of a proposed residential subdivision in order to better meet the
future open space and public site needs of the village. Where such dedication
is required, steep slopes, streams, lakes, water courses, and flood plains
shall constitute a maximum of 40% of the dedicated land. In addition, all land
proposed for dedication must have public access by adjoining street frontage of
not less than 100 feet, or by a public easement of equal size. In no instance
shall the Planning Commission require the dedication of park land where the
size of the proposed parcel would amount to less than ½ acre.
      (3)   In any residential subdivision where the dedication of land for
park purposes is deemed by the Planning Commission not to be in the best
interest of the general public, the Commission shall require, as a condition of
approval, fees to be paid according to the following schedule:
         (a)   $50 for each dwelling unit containing one bedroom.
         (b)   $100 for each dwelling unit containing two bedrooms.
         (c)   $200 for each dwelling unit containing three bedrooms.
         (d)   $300 for each dwelling unit containing four bedrooms.
         (e)   $400 for each dwelling unit containing five bedrooms.
      (4)   Where a fee in lieu of dedication is required as a result of the
construction of new housing within the village, such money shall be payable
upon issuance of a zoning permit. All fees collected as a result of new
residential subdivision development shall be used for the purpose of either
park land acquisition or development, but shall not be used for maintenance.
   (V)   Exterior building wall materials.
      (1)   General guidelines.
         (a)   When four or more new single-family or two-family residential
dwellings are erected on contiguous lots or condominium home sites, they shall,
at a minimum, consist of face brick materials on front exterior walls as
follows:
            1.   Front exterior wall of single story structures shall be 100%
face brick.

   (P)   Control of erosion and sedimentation.
      (1)   In the event that any developer shall intend to make significant
changes in the contour of any land proposed to be subdivided, developed, or
changed in use by grading, excavating, or the removal or destruction of the
natural topsoil, trees, or other vegetative covering thereon, the same shall
only be accomplished after the owner of the land or his or her agent has
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval a plan for erosion and
sedimentation controls, unless there has been a prior determination by the
Planning Commission that such plans are not necessary.
      (2)   Such plans shall contain adequate measures for control of erosion
and siltation where necessary, using the guidelines and policies contained
herein.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review these plans as submitted and
shall duly consider the recommendations submitted by the County Soil

provide a cash escrow guarantee, to be held by a company which is in the
practice of handling escrows, approved by the Municipal Attorney in an amount
determined by the Municipal Engineer, which would insure the village that
emergency measures could be taken by the village at the subdivider's expense,
if he or she did not initiate corrective action determined to be needed by the
Planning Commission or the Municipal Engineer. In this regard, the subdivider
shall at the time of final plan submission, deliver to the Municipal Manager
written instructions addressed to the escrow holder which shall authorize and
instruct the escrow holder to convey to the subdivider, after completion of the
entire subdivision, (as per the construction agreement) upon approval, by
resolution of the Municipal Council, the cash guarantee or to convey to the
village when the Municipal Council has approved such action, by resolution,
such amounts of the cash guarantee, as the resolution requires.
            3.   At the building permit application stage, a review will be
conducted by the Municipal Engineer to insure conformance with the plan as
approved.
            4.   During the construction phase, further consultive technical
assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Planning Commission or by
the local representative of the County Soil Conservation Service. The Planning
Commission or its duly authorized representative shall enforce compliance with
the approved plans.
            5.   The Municipal Engineer shall make a continuing review and
evaluation of the methods used and the overall effectiveness of the erosion and
sedimentation control program.
         (b)   Suggested control measures should be used for an effective
erosion and sedimentation control plan.

one time during development
            2.   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should
be kept to the shortest practical period of time.
            3.   Where necessary, temporary vegetation or mulching should be
used to protect areas exposed during development.
            4.   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt
traps) should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
            5.   Provisions should be made to effectively accommodate the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
            6.   The permanent final vegetation and structures should be
installed as soon as practical in the development.
            7.   The development plan should be fitted to the topography and
soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
            8.   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.
   (Q)   Soil preservation and seeding.
      (1)   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final grading has
been completed in accordance with the approved record plan. Topsoil shall not
be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed
so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four
inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by
seeding or planting.
      (2)   Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less than four pounds to each
1,000 square feet of land area. In the spring, the seed shall be sown between
March 15 and May 15; and in the fall, the seed shall be sown between August 15
and September 30. The seed shall consist of a maximum of 10% rye grass by
weight and a minimum of 90% by weight of permanent bluegrass or fescue grass.
All seed shall have been tested for germination within one year of the date of
seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label containing the seed
analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge of the unpaved right-
of-way back to a distance of 40 feet behind the principal residence on the lot.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until respreading of soil and
seeding of the lawn has been completed; except that between October 1 and March
15, and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant shall submit an agreement
in writing signed by the developer and the property owner, with a copy to the
Zoning Inspector, that the respreading of soil and seeding of the lawn will be
done during the immediately following planting season as set forth in this
section, and may be required to leave a cash escrow for performance in such
amount as shall be determined by the Zoning Inspector. Sod may be used to
comply with any requirement of seeding set forth herein.

ditches, as determined by the Municipal Engineer, to provide for the adequate
disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage
courses. The velocity of flow in an open ditch shall not exceed four feet per
second in soil ditches or six feet per second in turf gutters. Paved gutters
will be required if velocities of flow are greater than those specified or if
it is otherwise likely that destructive erosion will result. Drainage ditches
shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility.
   (V)   Storm sewers and storm water drainage. Where an adequate public storm
sewer is available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm
sewer system and connect with such storm sewer line. If such a storm sewer
system is not accessible, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system
and connect with natural drainage channels with easements of adequate width or
may be required to construct off site extensions to connect with an existing
storm sewer line as stated in division (CC) herein, of these regulations, and
as determined by the Municipal Engineer and approved by the Planning
Commission. Paved gutters or storm sewers shall be required if velocities of
flow are greater than specified in division (U) above, or cause destructive
erosion. Storm drainage, including drain tile around basements, shall not be
permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall connect to
an adequate drainage outlet.
   (W)   Catch basin grates. Grates over catch basins shall be of a type that
does not catch bicycle tires between the bars of the grate. The bars and
openings shall run perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
   (X)   Culverts and bridges. Where natural drainage channels intersect any
street right-of-way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to have
satisfactory bridges or culverts constructed. Where culverts are required,
minimum requirements shall be observed as follows:
      (1)   All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of
the proposed street. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be
approved by the Municipal Engineer. The minimum diameter of a culvert pipe
shall be 18 inches. Depending on existing drainage conditions, head walls may
be required.
      (2)   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of 20 feet, and a
minimum diameter of 12 inches. The driveway culvert shall be laid so as to
maintain the flow lines of the ditch or gutter. Head walls may be required.
   (Y)   Electric, gas, cable television, and telephone improvements.
      (1)   Electric service and telephone service shall be provided within
each subdivision. Gas or cable television service may be required where
reasonably accessible. Whenever such facilities are reasonably accessible and
available, they may be required to be installed within the area prior to the
approval of final plat. Telephone, electric, cable television, and street
lighting wires, conduits, and cables shall be constructed underground except in
cases where the Municipal Engineer determines that topographic, bedrock, or
underground water conditions would result in excessive costs to the subdivider.
      (2)   Overhead utility lines, where permitted, shall be located at the
rear of all lots. The width of the easement per lot shall be not less than five
feet and the total easement width shall not be less than ten feet.
      (3)   Whenever a sanitary sewer line and an electric or telephone line
are placed underground in the same utility easement, the following provisions
shall be applicable:
         (a)   The total easement width shall not be less than 20 feet, and
         (b)   The sanitary sewer line shall be installed within five feet of
one side of the easement, and the electric or telephone lines shall be
installed within five feet of the opposite side of the easement.
   (Z)   Over-size and off-site improvements. The utilities, pavements, and
other land improvements required for the proposed subdivision shall be designed
of over-size or with extensions provided to serve nearby land which is an
integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage area as determined by the
Municipal Engineer.
   (AA)   Cost of over-size improvements. The subdivider shall be required to
pay for only that part of the construction costs for the arterial streets,
trunk sewers, or water lines which are serving the proposed subdivision as
determined by the Municipal Engineer. The village shall pay the difference
between the cost of required improvements for the proposed subdivision and
improvements required to service the surrounding areas as specified in division
(Z) above.
   (BB)   Extensions to boundaries. The subdivider shall be required to extend
the necessary improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land.
   (CC)   Off-site extension. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, and if the Municipal Planning Commission
finds that the extensions across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a
special assessment to the intervening properties or as a municipal expense
until some future time, the subdivider may be required, prior to approval of
the final plat, to obtain necessary easements or rights-of-way and construct
and pay for such extensions. Such improvements shall be available for
connections by subdividers of adjoining land.
   (DD)   Protection and opening to traffic. The subdivider shall protect the
pavement against all damage prior to final acceptance of the work. Traffic
shall be excluded from the pavement by erecting and maintaining barricades and
signs until the concrete is at least seven days old. This traffic restriction
shall apply to the contractor's construction equipment and vehicles as well as
general traffic. As soon as curing and sealing are completed, the subdivider
shall remove all dirt, debris, and construction equipment from the pavement.
   (EE)   Protection of utility lines. The subdivider shall at all times take
proper precautions for the protection of utility lines, the presence of which
are known, or can be determined by the examination of appropriate maps of the
utility companies and the village. The subdivider shall be financially
responsible for the repair of any damage to such service line.
   (FF)   Protection of miscellaneous public and private installations. The
subdivider shall, at all times, take proper precautions for the protection of
and placement of driveway culverts, street intersections, culverts, aprons,
mail boxes, driveway approaches, and all other public and private installations
that may be encountered during construction as well as significant tree cover.
Written approval for complete replacement or restoration work may be required
by the Planning Commission, or its duly authorized representative. Any damage
done to the improvements by construction traffic, local traffic, or by any
other means shall be repaired or the damaged materials replaced before the next

§ 151.06 REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   General statement.
      (1)   Planned unit developments are separate entities with a distinct
character which is intended to be in harmony with surrounding developments.
Projects which are designed solely to circumvent these regulations or other
applicable zoning resolutions shall not be approved. The project must clearly
demonstrate that natural features are being preserved, that amenities are being
provided which would enhance the livability of the project and that such
attributes of the project could not be achieved with strict adherence to these
regulations.
      (2)   Zoning approval of a planned unit development does not constitute
either preliminary or final subdivision approval.
   (B)   Development standards.
      (1)   A major element of the planned unit development is privately owned
or publicly owned common property within the development. These developments
usually contain such features as an internal park network abutting home sites,
recreational facilities, and preservation of natural amenities. A home owners
association should be established to provide for the maintenance of all
properties held in common.
      (2)   A planned unit development may be exempt from the conventional
development standards of this chapter only upon proper justification.
      (3)   The design of internal circulation systems shall be sensitive to
such points of safety, convenience, access to dwelling units and non-
residential facilities, separation of vehicular and pedestrian-bicycle traffic,
and general attractiveness. Internal streets shall be adequate to carry
anticipated traffic and yet provide convenient and safe access. Access for
emergency vehicles must be considered.
   (C)   Conformity to existing streets and major thoroughfare plan. Whenever a
planned unit development abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
thoroughfare, the right-of-way standards as contained in these regulations and
the major thoroughfare plan shall be applicable. If a planned unit development
abuts or contains an existing minor residential street, it must meet the
requirements of these regulations.
   (D)   Private streets. Private streets may be permitted in planned unit
developments provided they meet the following requirements:
      (1)   A minimum street pavement width of 32 feet or of such width the
Planning Commission deems necessary for the type of development.
      (2)   The pavement thickness and materials used shall be constructed in
accordance with the standards and specifications on file in the office of the
Municipal Engineer.
      (3)   A home owners association or other appropriate method is
established to maintain the street system, water lines, storm and sanitary
sewers, and other improvements not dedicated to the village.
      (4)   The centerline radius for streets must not be less than 45 feet.
   (E)   Public streets. The Planning Commission may require certain streets
within planned unit developments to be public if it determines that the project
density necessitates the use of public streets and that traffic connections are
required to adjacent plats or developments for adequate circulation.
   (F)   Staging of residential planned unit development. Each stage of a
planned unit development must be designed so as to stand independently of
future related stages in the event future stages are not constructed. The
construction and provision of all of the common open spaces and public and
recreational facilities which are shown on the final development plan for the
development must proceed at the same rate as the construction of dwelling
units.
   (G)   Staging of nonresidential construction. If a planned unit development
contains nonresidential uses, these uses may be constructed first, but only if
the Planning Commission finds and records its finding on the final development
plan that the nonresidential uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan
for the village even though the residential area of the planned unit
development is not built or not completed.
   (H)   Common open space guarantee. The Planning Commission may require
adequate assurance, in a form and manner which it approves, that the common
open space shown in the final development plan will be provided and that
designated trees are preserved. The following methods of assurance may be used
singularly or in combinations:
      (1)   A bond, corporate surety, or other acceptable financial guarantee
in a form which complies with the provisions of this chapter and in an amount
sufficient to purchase the common open space shown or trees shown on the final
development plan or alternative acreage which is equivalent in size and
character.
      (2)   The land shown as common open space may be put in escrow, the
escrow agreement to provide that the land is to be held in escrow until the
Planning Commission has certified to the escrow agent that the planned unit
development has been completed.
      (3)   If any of the planned unit development which includes common open
space is held by the developer in option, the developer may assign to the
applicable governmental entity the right to exercise the option to acquire the
common open space.
   (I)   Condominiums. R.C. Ch. 5311 provides for the recording of ownership of
condominiums. Condominium ownership does not excuse compliance with these
regulations whenever they are appropriate.
('80 Code, § 151.07) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.07 RECORDING OF PLAT.
   No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded by the County Recorder or have
any validity until such plat has received final approval in the manner
prescribed in these regulations.
('80 Code, § 151.08) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83)
§ 151.08 REVISION OF PLAT AFTER APPROVAL.
   No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in any plat
of a subdivision after approval has been given by the Municipal Planning
Commission, and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless such plat is first
resubmitted to the Commission.
('80 Code, § 151.09) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.09 SALE OF LAND WITHIN SUBDIVISIONS.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision
shall transfer or sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or by the use
of a plat of the subdivision before such plat has been approved and recorded in
the manner prescribed in these regulations. The description of such lot or
parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents
used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction
from the provisions of these regulations.
('80 Code, § 151.10) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.10 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW DEPOSIT COLLECTION.
   (A)   Generally. Upon the submittal of any plan consisting of a building of
more than 1,000 square feet, a subdivision of more than a division of land into
two parcels, a site plan review or revision to an existing approved site plan,
a proposed Planned Unit Development (PUD) or a revision to an approved PUD, a
Development of Regional Impact (DRI), an amendment to the Comprehensive Land
Development Plan (CLDP), a rezoning, the Municipal Manager or his or her
designee shall ensure that a review deposit of $250 has been collected and a
separate project account has been established with the Director of Finance and
Records for the reimbursement of municipality expenses paid to consultants
employed by the municipality for the provision of technical and professional
services in related project review(s).
   (B)   Extraordinary Development Review Deposits. The Municipal Manager may
require a Development Review Deposit to be collected or increased when in the
sole discretion of the Municipal Manager that the standard Development Review
Deposit would be inadequate to preserve the cash flow of the municipality. An
extraordinary Development Review Deposit shall be in multiples of the standard
Development Review Deposit not to exceed any initial deposit of $2,500.
   (C)   Additional Payments to the Development Review Deposit. Each month
after payments have been made to the consultants employed by the municipality
to assist in the development review process and the municipality has been
reimbursed its cost from the funds on deposit with such municipality for
Development Review, the Director of Finance and Records shall submit to a
development project owner/representative an invoice for the amount(s) necessary
to return the Development Review Deposit Project Account to its required
balance as a revolving fund for the reimbursement of actual paid consultant
services used in the review of a development project.
   (D)   Approvals Subject to Payment of Development Review Cost. Development
related approvals granted by the municipality by its Planning Commission and/or
its Council are not final until all related development review costs have been
invoices to the project owner/representative and received by the Director of
Finance and Records.
   (E)   Return of Unused Development Review Deposits. Any portion of the funds
placed on deposit or additional payments made to the municipality for a
Development Review Deposit for augmentation remaining after all invoices from
consultants have been received, and related payments have been made by the
municipality shall be refunded to the project owner/representative.
(Ord. 95-05, passed 3-7-95)
§ 151.11 VARIANCES.
   The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (A)   Where the Municipal Planning Commission finds that extraordinary and
unnecessary hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations,
due to exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, the Commission may
vary the regulations so as to relieve such hardship, provided such relief may
be granted without detriment to the public interest and without impairing the
intent and purpose of these regulations or the desirable development of the
neighborhood and community. Such variations shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, the comprehensive plan,
or the Zoning Code, if such exists.
   (B)   In granting variances or modifications, the Municipal Planning
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgement, secure
substantially the objective of the standards or requirements so varied or
modified.
('80 Code, § 151.13) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83)
§ 151.12 DEFERRAL OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Planning Commission may defer at the time of final approval, subject to
appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in
its judgement, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety,
and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack
of connecting facilities. Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because
of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting
facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his or her share of
the costs of the future improvements to the village prior to the signing of the
record plan, or the subdivider may post a bond insuring completion of the
improvements upon demand of the village.
('80 Code, § 151.14) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83)
§ 151.13 APPEAL.
   Any person who believes that he or she has been aggrieved by the regulations
or the action of the Municipal Planning Commission has all the rights of appeal
as set forth in R.C. Ch. 711, or any other applicable section of the Ohio
Revised Code.
('80 Code, § 151.15) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83)
§ 151.14 EFFECTIVE DATE; RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.
   (A)   Effective date. These regulations shall become effective from and
after the date of their approval and adoption by the Municipal Council, after
public hearing and certification to the County Recorder. Thereafter, any other
regulations previously adopted by the Municipal Council or the Municipal
Planning Commission shall be deemed to be repealed.
   (B)   Retroactive application. These regulations shall not apply to any
subdivision having received preliminary approval prior to the effective date
established herein, unless any changes to the preliminary plat are introduced
by the subdivider. In such a case these regulations shall apply, but if
appropriate, the subdivision may request and the Municipal Planning Commission
grant a variance, as provided for herein at §
151.11.
('80 Code, § 151.16) (Ord. 83-18, passed 12-20-83)

   The following penalties shall apply to the violations of these regulations:
   (A)   Whoever violates these regulations or any rule or regulation adopted
by the Municipal Council for the purpose of setting standards and requiring and
securing the construction of improvements within a subdivision or fails to
comply with any order pursuant thereto is creating a public nuisance and the
creation thereof may be enjoined and maintenance thereof may be abated by
action at suit of the village or any citizen thereof. Whoever violates these
regulations or any rule or regulation adopted by the Municipal Council shall
forfeit and pay not less than $100 nor more than $1000 plus the cost to correct
the nuisance. Such sum may be recovered in a civil action brought in any court
of jurisdiction, including the County Court of Common Pleas. Each day a
violation persists shall be considered a separate violation of these
regulations.
   (B)   A County Recorder who records a plat contrary to the provisions of
these regulations shall forfeit and pay not less than $100 nor more than $500,
to be recovered in a civil action in the name and for the use of the village.
   (C)   Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land within the
jurisdiction of the village as determined by §
151.01(C), transfers any lot, parcel, or tract of such land from or in
accordance with a plat of a subdivision before such plat has been recorded in
the office of the County Recorder shall forfeit and pay the sum of not less
than $100 nor more than $500 for each lot, parcel, or tract of land so sold.
The description of such lot, parcel, or tract by metes and bounds in the deed
or transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the forfeiture provided
in this section. Such sum may be recovered in a civil action brought in any
court of jurisdiction, including the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery
County, by the village.
   (D)   Any person who disposes of, offers for sale or leases for a time
exceeding five years any lot or any part of a lot in a subdivision before the
provisions of these regulations are complied with shall forfeit and pay the sum
of not less than $100 nor more than $500 for each lot or parcel of a lot so
sold, offered for sale, or leased, to be recovered in a civil action in the
name of the village.

   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   Variances on lots. To authorize, on appeal, in specific cases, such
variance from the terms of this zoning code as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to special conditions of the land, (that is, an
irregularly shaped lot having the required area; a lot of exceptional
topography; or an exceptionally narrow, shallow or irregular lot) existing and
of record at the time of the passage of this zoning code, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this zoning code will result in unnecessary hardship. In
granting such variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards to maintain the intent and spirit of the zoning
district in conformity with this zoning code.
      (2)   Variances on existing buildings and structures. To grant the
projection of an existing building or structure into a required yard to secure

Appeals shall prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to maintain the
intent and spirit of the zoning district in conformity with this zoning code.
      (3)   Use provisions applicable. Divisions (B)(1) and (2) shall not be
construed to permit variances which shall in effect amend the use provisions in
this chapter.
   (C)   Conditional uses. To grant conditional certificates for the use of
land, buildings, or other structures, if such certificates for specific uses
are provided for in this zoning code.

related to said appeals, deny, uphold, or otherwise modify or waive the Zoning
Inspector's actions on a case-by-case basis as they related to well field
protection.
   (F)   Determination of similar use. Where a specific use is proposed that is
not specifically listed or provided for in a zoning district under this zoning
code, the Board of Zoning Appeals may make a determination, upon appeal, that
the proposed use is substantially similar to a specific use that is listed or
provided for in such zoning district.
   (G)   In appeals from the Property Maintenance Enforcement Administrator, to
make such findings and rulings as are set forth in this code.

§ 152.015 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A VARIANCE.
   (A)   Nature of variance. A variance is permission to deviate in a specific
manner from the terms of the zoning code, where, owing to special conditions of
the land itself, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this zoning code
will result in unnecessary hardship, and provided that only deviations from
development standards shall be permitted.
   (B)   Authorization. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize variances
from the terms of this zoning code as stated in §
152.013(B) when the Board of Zoning Appeals has made findings of fact based on

on forms provided by the village, which shall contain the following:
      (1)   Description of property and nature of variance. Description of
property and nature of variance:
         (a)   The nature of the variance, including the specific provisions of
this zoning code from which the variance is requested;

reference to the volume and page of the last recorded deed;
         (c)   A statement of the special circumstances or conditions applying
to the land or structure and not applying generally throughout the zoning
district;
         (d)   A statement showing that the special conditions and
circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant;
         (e)   A statement showing that the granting of the variance is

it shall, in each specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based
on the particular evidence presented to it that support conclusions that:
      (1)   The variance requested arises from special conditions of, or
involving, the property which are unique (that is, a situation which is not
ordinarily found in the same zoning district) and that the situation results
from the enforcement of this zoning code and not by an action or actions of the
property owner, the applicant, or any other person or party who has had control
of the property;
      (2)   The strict application of the provisions of this zoning code, from
which a variance is requested, will constitute unnecessary hardship on the
property owner represented in the application;
      (3)   The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health,
safety, and morals; and
      (4)   The variance desired will not compromise the general spirit and
intent of this zoning code.
   (F)   Conditions and restrictions. In granting a variance, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions, safeguards, and restrictions on the
premises benefited by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set out in division (E) of this section to reduce or minimize
potentially injurious effects of the variance on other property in the
neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this zoning
code.
   (G)   Decision on variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have all
powers of the Zoning Inspector with respect to the decision. The concurring
vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any decision of the Zoning Inspector under this
zoning code. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a written decision on the
application without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, and, in
all cases, within 30 days after the close of the hearing.

within the zoning district regulations in recognition that such uses, although
often desirable, will more intensely affect the surrounding area in which they
are located than the permitted uses of the zoning district. The intent of the
procedure for authorizing a conditional use is to set forth the development
standards and criteria for locating and developing a conditional use in
accordance with the nature of the surrounding area, conditions of development,
and with regard to appropriate plans.
   (B)   Application for conditional use.
      (1)   Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an

use to the neighborhood or community.;
            4.   A statement of the compatibility of the proposed use to
adjacent property and land use; and
            5.   Such other information regarding the property, proposed use,
or surrounding area as may be pertinent to the application or required for
appropriate action by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (b)   Plot plan. The application shall be accompanied by two copies of
the plot plan, drawn to an appropriate scale, clearly showing the following:
            1.   The boundaries and dimensions of the lot;
            2.   The size and location of existing and proposed structures;
            3.   The proposed use of all parts of the lot and structures,
including access ways, walks, off-street parking, loading spaces, and

development standards in the existing zoning district; and
            5.   The use of land and location of structures on adjacent
property.
   (C)   Hearing on conditional use. A hearing on the application shall be held
by the Board and notice thereof given, as specified under §
152.014(C).
   (D)   Standards for conditional use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not
grant a conditional use unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific
findings of fact directly based on the particular evidence presented to it that
support conclusions that:
      (1)   The proposed conditional use will comply with all applicable
regulations of this zoning code, including lot size requirements, development
standards, and use limitations;
      (2)   Adequate utility, drainage, and other necessary facilities have
been or will be provided;
      (3)   Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided
and will be so designed as to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic
conflicts and congestion in public streets and alleys;
      (4)   All necessary permits and licenses for the use and operation of the
conditional use have been obtained, or evidence has been submitted that such
permits are obtainable for the proposed conditional use on the subject
property;
      (5)   All exterior lights for artificial open-air illumination are so
shaded as to avoid casting direct light on any property located in a
residential district;
      (6)   The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and
intensity of the operation involved or conducted in connection with it, the
size of the site in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect
to streets giving access to it, shall be such that it will be in harmony with
the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is located;
      (7)   The location, nature, and height of buildings, structures, walls,
and fences on the site and the nature and extent of landscaping and screening
on the site shall be such that the use will not unreasonably hinder or
discourage the appropriate development, use, and enjoyment of adjacent land,
buildings, and structures; and
      (8)   The conditional use desired will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, and morals.
   (E)   Conditions and restrictions. In granting a conditional use
certificate, the Board may impose such conditions, safeguards, and restrictions
on the premises benefited by the conditional use as may be necessary to comply
with the standards set out in division (D) above, to reduce or minimize
potentially injurious affects of such conditional uses on other property in the
neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this zoning
code.
   (F)   Period of validity. A conditional use certificate granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall terminate at the end of the period designated by the
Board from the date on which the Board grants the conditional use.

§ 152.139 GROUNDWATER HAZARD POTENTIAL RANKING SYSTEM.
   (A)   Any existing uses legally storing, handling, using, and/or producing
regulated substances in amounts equal to or less than the requirements under §
152.138(A) are considered conforming uses, and this section does not apply. Any
new use or change of use shall maintain the conforming status of the property.
   (B)   Existing nonconforming uses shall be permitted to maintain the
reported maximum quantity for each reportable regulated substance, as reported
according to §
152.266, as determined by peak business cycle. Existing uses and maximum
quantities, in combination with a hazard potential rating shall run with the
land and be administered in conformance with all other applicable nonconforming
provisions of the village zoning code.
   (C)   In order to assess the risk for potential ground water contamination,
a hazard ranking has been developed for various activities categorized by their
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. This ranking is based on the
kind of materials commonly associated with each use, looking only at the most
critical hydrologic factors.
   (D)   Table I set forth following this section lists the site hazard
potential by land use activity on a scale of one to nine, with one being a low
hazard and nine a very high hazard. This rating is based on the intrinsic
hazards posed by different land uses and is related to the materials commonly
used or stored on the site or the types and amounts of wastes commonly
discharged.
   (E)   Table II set forth following this section lists the hazard potential
determined on the basis of materials known to be used, stored, or disposed of
at a specific site.
   (F)   If the two tables which are referenced above [and which begin on the
following page] indicate different site hazard potential ratings for the SIC-
coded land use activity and the materials found on-site, the higher of the two
scores is the rating for the site.

      (7)   One copy of the preliminary plat, if applicable.
   (C)   Action by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall hold
a public hearing on the development plan as provided by §
152.019. The public hearing shall consider all aspects of the development plan
including all proposed stages and/or units of development. The Planning
Commission may recommend disapproval, approval, or approval with amendments,
conditions, or restrictions. The Planning Commission shall prepare and transmit
to Council and to the applicant its recommendation and specific findings of
fact with respect to the extent to which the development plan complies with the
standards set out in §
152.159 and the district for which the change has been requested. Copies of the

('80 Code, § 152.159) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.160 SUBDIVISION PLAT REQUIRED.
   No building permit shall be issued for any structure in any portion of a
planned development unless and until the final subdivision plat for that
portion has been approved by the village Planning Commission and recorded in
the public record of Montgomery County. This requirement may be waived by the
Planning Commission when it is deemed that a subdivision plat is not required.
('80 Code, § 152.160) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.161 MODIFICATION OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Because of the difficulty in being able to supply precise data at the
time of approval of the final development plan, it may be necessary to make
certain modifications to the final development plan at a later date. Such
modifications shall have the recommendation of the Planning Commission and be
approved by Council without additional public hearings. Owners of property
within 300 feet of the area in question will be mailed notice of the time at
which the Council will review the request for modification. This notice will be
mailed at least seven days prior to such review by the Council.
   (B)   Modification to the final development plan shall not deter from the
general intent and purpose as originally approved by Council. No modification
shall be approved that will increase density or intensity, increase the LUI
index number, decrease parking and loading areas, reduce useable open space, or
reduce distance between structures and the perimeter property line. Any such
modifications shall require the zoning district amendment procedures of §
152.158 to be followed.
   (C)   If a modification is approved, the final development plan will be
changed to reflect the modification and notice will be sent to the Building
Inspection Department and Zoning Inspector.

proper authority.
('80 Code, § 152.164) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.165 EXISTING BUILDING PERMITS.
   Nothing contained in this zoning code shall require any change in the

control.
('80 Code, § 152.165) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.166 NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS.
   (A)   Nonconforming vacant lots in residential district. In any district
where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached dwelling may be erected on
any lot of official record as of the effective date of this zoning code when by
reason of its lot area, width, or depth it does not meet minimum requirements
for a lot under these regulations. However, no lot shall be deemed to be less
than 40 feet wide for the calculation of yard requirements, and provided,
further, that:
      (1)   The sum of the side yard widths on any such lot of record shall be
at least 25% of the width of the lot;
      (2)   In no case shall the width of any side yard be less than 10% of the
width of the lot, except that on a corner lot the width of side yard adjoining
the side street lot line shall be not less than ten feet;
      (3)   The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed 20% of
the depth of the lot, but in no case shall it be less than 20 feet; and
      (4)   If the width of such lot meets the standards of this zoning code
but the depth is such that the total area is less than 7,500 square feet, the
rear yard for such lot shall have a minimum of 30% of the depth of the lot but
in no case shall it be less than 30 feet.
   (B)   Nonconforming vacant lots in other districts. In any district, other
than a residential district, a building designed for any permitted use in the
district may be erected on any lot of official record as of the effective date
of this zoning district provided that the building shall comply with all
regulations applicable in the district in which the lot in question is located.
However, the width of any required side yard need not be greater than that
derived by applying the following equation, where X equals the required side
yard width:
         X         =   minimum side yard required by district regulation
      actual lot width         minimum lot width required by district
regulation

§ 152.167 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Continuation. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is
permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located

development standards, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the restrictions of divisions (B), (C), and (D) of this
section.
   (B)   Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any structure described in (A) above
may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered. However, no
such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration shall either
create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing
nonconformity of all or any part of such structures; except that as to
structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size
requirements, the side yard requirements shall be determined by §
152.166 (A) or (B), whichever is applicable.
   (C)   Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure described in
(A) above is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 75%
of the current replacement cost of the entire structure, the structure shall
not be restored unless it shall thereafter conforms to the regulations for the
zoning district in which it is located, provided that structures located on a
lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements shall not in
any event be required to provide a side yard that exceeds the yard requirements
in §
152.166(A) or (B), whichever is applicable. When a structure is damaged to the
extent of 75% or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning
certificate is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after
the date of the partial destruction.
   (D)   Moving. No structure described in (A) above shall be moved in whole or
in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any
other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the

strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a building or other structure
(other than a damaged or destroyed building or other structure subject to the
provisions of division (E) below) in accordance with the order of a public
official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares the
building or other structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe
condition.
      (3)   Nonconforming residential buildings in a business or industrial
district may be maintained, repaired, improved, modernized, or enlarged.
However, no increase in the number of dwelling units shall be permitted.

the entire building or other structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which the structure is located
except as provided in divisions (D), (E), and (G) below.
   (D)   Extensions and enlargement. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a
nonconforming building or structure to be extended, expanded, enlarged, or
increased in intensity subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of the
building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or
arranged for such use on the effective date of this zoning code or any
appropriate amendment thereto;
      (2)   The Board may permit either an expansion of a nonconforming
building or structure, or a substitution of a nonconforming use in such a
building or structure, but not both; and
      (3)   A nonconforming building or structure may be extended or enlarged
on the lot occupied by the building on the effective date of this zoning code
or on an adjoining lot, provided such lot was under the same ownership as the

building may be enlarged or extended to an extent not exceeding 25% of the
gross floor area of the nonconforming structure or building lawfully existing
at the time of the adoption of this zoning code;
      (4)   The extension or enlargement of a nonconforming building or
structure may not occupy ground space suitable and otherwise available for
meeting the off-street parking requirements of this zoning code;
      (5)   A nonconforming use of land may not be extended, enlarged, or
increased in intensity;
      (6)   Nothing contained in this section shall in any way prohibit a

      (7)   Application for an extension or enlargement in accordance with
divisions (D)(1) through (D)(6) shall be noticed and heard in the manner
prescribed for appeals in §

   (E)   Damage or destruction. In the event that any building or other
structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged
or destroyed, by any means, to such an extent that the cost of restoration to
the condition in which it was before the damage or destruction exceeds 75% of
the current replacement cost of the entire building or other structure,
exclusive of foundation, the building or other structure shall not be restored
unless the building or other structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. Moreover,
even if the damage is 75% or less, no repair or restoration shall be made
unless a building permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun, within
one year after the date of the partial destruction.
   (F)   Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved to any other location on the same lot or any other lot
unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the district in which it will be located after being so moved.
Moreover, no nonconforming land use shall be relocated, in whole or in part, to
any other location on the same or any other lot unless such use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located
after being moved.

152.999
§ 152.182 FENCES, WALLS, AND HEDGES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The intent of these provisions is to outline the regulations for
accessory fences, walls and hedges. Such structures provide screening, privacy
and security, provide a physical and visual barrier, improve pedestrian and
vehicular traffic flow, and enhance aesthetics on private property.
      (2)   The purpose of these regulations is to control the design and
installation of fences, protect the general appearance of property within the
community, and preserve the health and safety of the general public.
   (B)   General provisions.
      (1)   No barbed wired or electric fence with the exception of an
underground animal containment system is permitted in a residential district.
      (2)   A permit is required prior to the installation of a new fence or
fence section, or the relocation of any part of an existing fence located in
any side or rear yard.
      (3)   Fences, walls, and hedges shall not impede, inhibit, or obstruct
culverts, drains, natural watercourses, or storm water drainage in any zoning
district. No fence shall be constructed so as to alter the natural drainage of
an existing property.
      (4)   No fill or earthen berm, which results in a change of existing
grade in developed or built-up areas of the village, shall be used to
accommodate the placement of a fence or wall.
      (5)   All fences shall be installed so that support posts and other
support mechanisms face the inside part of the fence and provides at least one
easily accessible access point.
      (6)   All fences and walls, and any related supported structures or
appurtenances, shall be contained within the lot lines of the applicable lot
and shall not encroach into adjoining or abutting lots and/or rights-of-way.
Property owners, with written permission from abutting property owners, may
connect to fences on adjoining properties.
      (7)   It shall be the duty of each lot owner and contractor, or an agent
thereof, to determine lot lines and to ascertain that the fence or wall does
not deviate from the plans as approved by the village issuing any applicable
certificate or permit, and that the fence or wall does not encroach on another
lot or existing easement. The issuance of the certificate or permit, and any
inspection by the village, shall not be construed to mean that the village has
determined the fence is not encroaching on another lot, nor shall it relieve
the property owner of the duty imposed on him or herein.
      (8)   All fence line or property line disputes are civil in nature and
are not the responsibility of the village to resolve. When a fence appears to
be erected on the property line it is the responsibility of both property
owners to maintain the weeds and grass on their side of the fence according to
the Property Maintenance Code.
      (9)   Both sides of all fences or walls and the surrounding property,
where reasonably accessible, shall be maintained in equally good condition in
accordance with the Property Maintenance Code. Materials used to build,
maintain, and repair fences shall be similar to the existing material so as not
to create a patchwork appearance.
      (10)   Walls shall be prohibited within all utility easements. Fences
that are placed in utility easements are subject to removal without notice by
utility companies or the village when work is being done in the utility
easements. Replacement of the fence shall be at the property owner's expense.
      (11)   If any provision of this section is violated, the Code Enforcement
Administrator may order that the fence or wall be removed. No property owner
shall fail to remove such fence or wall within ten days of the order.
      (12)   Residential front yards.
         (a)   No fences, wall, hedges, or plantings shall be permitted to
interfere with visibility to or from a driveway or corner intersection.
         (b)   Decorative front yard fences shall not exceed three feet in
height, except for decorative posts which may not exceed 42 inches. Decorative
front yard walls, when built of solid masonry or stone materials, shall not
exceed two feet in height within the required front yard.
         (c)   Such fence or wall may not be located closer than one foot to
the rear edge of the sidewalk; however, no fence or wall shall be constructed
within the designated right-of-way.
         (d)   The length of a decorative front yard fence or wall shall not
exceed 50% of the property frontage as measured at the public right-of-way. For
the purposes of this Code, corner lots shall be considered as having two
frontages.
         (e)   A minimum of 50% visibility must be maintained through the
decorative fence.
         (f)   In no case, shall chain link, wire or steel mesh, plywood,
particle board and other non-traditional fence materials be permitted in the
front yard.
      (13)   Residential side and rear yards.
         (a)   The side yard is considered the area from the front foundation
of the house over to the side property line going towards the rear of the
property then back over to the rear foundation of the house. The rear yard is
considered that area from the rear wall of the house over to the side property
line and then back towards the rear property line.
         (b)   A privacy fence shall not exceed six feet in height.
         (c)   Privacy fences, once erected, shall be maintained and repaired
of similar materials.
         (d)   Any fence other than a privacy fence cannot exceed 48 inches in
height.
         (e)   Chain link fences with webbing designed to inhibit light,
ventilation, or sight through the fence shall not be allowed as privacy fences.
         (f)   Fences on corner lots must be erected a minimum of three feet
from the sidewalk or right of way. However, in no instance, shall a fence,
wall, hedge or planting interfere with visibility to or from a driveway or
corner intersection.
         (g)   Fences in residential districts shall be constructed of metal
chain link; vinyl coated chain link; iron; vinyl; naturally durable wood; or
treated wood.
      (14)   Non-residential districts.
         (a)   Fences used in conjunction with tennis courts and back stops for
ball fields shall be exempt from the height limitations; however, in no case,
shall a tennis court or back stop be more than 12 feet in height.
         (b)   Fences in industrial districts cannot exceed ten feet in height
and shall be constructed of metal chain link, vinyl coated chain link or wood.
         (c)   The use of barbed wire for fencing purposes shall only be
permitted in the industrial and agricultural districts.
         (d)   Barbed wire is only permitted on fencing eight feet in height or
higher.
         (e)   Fences in agricultural areas can be constructed of metal chain
link; vinyl coated chain link; poultry, chicken, rabbit or field wire only when
sufficiently supported by wood split rail.

a regular basis and shall be maintained in a neat, orderly, and sanitary
condition.
   (B)   In no instance shall any such refuse be visible above the required
enclosure.
   (C)   A decorative masonry wall of six feet in height shall enclose three
sides of the storage area. Bollards and/or other protective devices shall be

to the screening walls. The surface under any such storage area shall be
constructed of concrete which complies with local building requirements.
   (D)   Any such storage area shall be located in a rear yard and/or be so
located and arranged as to minimize its visibility from adjacent streets and

be reduced by the written consent of the owner or owners of abutting property,
but in any event, adequate lateral support shall be provided for the abutting
property.
      (2)   In the event that the site of the mining operation is adjacent to
the right-of-way of any public street or road, no part of the operation shall
take place closer than 50 feet to the nearest line of the right-of-way, except
as may otherwise be provided by R.C. § 4153.11.

Zoning Appeals, at its discretion, may fix a bond in a reasonable amount to
assure that the rehabilitation and reclamation will be carried out. The Board
of Zoning Appeals shall be guided by the following standards with respect to
rehabilitation and reclamation of mined-out areas:
      (1)   All excavation shall be made either to a water-producing depth,
such depth to be not less than five feet below the water mark, or shall be
graded or backfilled with non-noxious, non-combustible, and non-flammable
solids, to secure:
         (a)   That the excavated area shall not collect, and permit to remain
therein, stagnant water; or,
         (b)   That the surface of the area which is not permanently submerged
is graded or backfilled as necessary so as to reduce the peaks and depressions
thereof so as to produce a gently rolling surface that will minimize erosion
due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining
land area.
      (2)   The banks of all sand and gravel excavations in a water-producing
excavation, and to the pit bottom in a dry operation, shall be sloped to the
water line, at a slope which will not be less than three feet horizontal to one
foot vertical, and the banks shall be restored with vegetation in a manner set
forth in §
152.197(C)(3).
      (3)   Vegetation shall be restored by the spreading of sufficient solid
and by appropriate seeding of grasses or planting of shrubs and trees in all
parts of the mining area where the same is not submerged under water.
      (4)   Proper drainage shall be provided for the mined-out area.
      (5)   All equipment and structures shall be removed from the mined-out
area within six months of the completion of the mining therefrom.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such other reasonable
conditions and restrictions as it may deem necessary for the protection of the
public and to encourage the mining and processing of the sand and gravel from
the authorized area.
      (7)   Due to the inherent difficulties in reclaiming and rehabilitating
areas from which stone has been quarried, the Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
empowered, in the issuance of a conditional use permit for quarrying
operations, to impose such reasonable standards for reclamation as may be
necessary to protect the public interest, without unduly restricting the
operations of the mine owner.

§ 152.200 COMMUNITY-ORIENTED RESIDENTIAL SOCIAL SERVICE FACILITIES AND HALFWAY
HOUSES.
   (A)   Submission requirements. The operator or agency applying for a
conditional use permit to operate a community-oriented residential social
service facility or halfway house shall submit the following information to aid
the Board of Zoning Appeals in its review of the requested facility:
      (1)   Identification of similar facilities presently existing within the
village and contiguous jurisdictions and confirmation that the siting of the
facility is compatible with the Residential Care Opportunities Guide for
Montgomery County;
      (2)   A license or evidence of ability to obtain a license, if such is
required, from the pertinent governmental unit prior to operation. Prior to the
issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, the operator or agency shall
provide evidence that a valid license has been issued or is obtainable for the
proposed conditional use on the subject property. If licensing is not required,
an affidavit from the applicant so stating shall be presented;
      (3)   A copy of the sponsoring agency's operational and occupancy
standards and a detailed plan for services and programs; and
      (4)   A site plan for the proposed home indicating home structure outline
and floor plan, off-street parking provisions, driveway access, landscaping and
screening provisions, recreational and open space facilities as well as other
pertinent information which the Board of Zoning Appeals may require. Such plan
shall include sufficient information to indicate that the proposed site will be
compatible with the character of the neighborhood.
   (B)   Facility requirements.
      (1)   Every room occupied for sleeping purposes within the home shall
contain a minimum of 80 square feet of habitable room area for one occupant,
and when occupied by more than one person, shall contain at least 60 square
feet of habitable room area for each occupant.
      (2)   Indoor and outdoor recreational space shall be provided for the
clientele served, based upon standards specified by the licensing authority
and/or the sponsoring agency. If no such standards exist, then the following
minimum area shall apply:
         (a)   Common indoor area shall consist of at least 25 square feet per
individual.
         (b)   Common outdoor area shall consist of at least 60 square feet per
individual. If a public park or other common open space is available in the
immediate vicinity of the facility, the Board of Zoning Appeals may waive the
outdoor space requirement.
         (c)   No exterior alterations of the structure shall be made which
depart from the residential character of the building. All new structures
proposed shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

substituted for a portion of the required off-street spaces if approved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (f)   No facility shall be permitted within 1,500 feet of another
community-oriented residential social service facility or halfway house. The
Board of Zoning Appeals may reduce this standard if the applicant can show
that, due to unique conditions, a reduction of the separation requirement will
not contribute to the concentration of such facilities. (For example, the
proposed site is located in a distinctly different neighborhood which is
separated from an existing site by a freeway or the site is in an area that
does not constitute a typical residential neighborhood due to a diversity of
land uses.)
         (g)   The facility must be reviewed by the Fire Chief or a certified
fire safety inspector.
   (C)   Findings by the Board of Zoning Appeals. In its review of each
proposed facility, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make specific findings of
fact relative to the following criteria. Upon finding all such facts to be
true, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant the conditional use. The Board
shall find that the proposed facility:
      (1)   Complies with all the applicable facilities requirements;
      (2)   Is in fact a community-based residential social service facility or
halfway house licensed by an agency of the state (and respective jurisdiction).
If such licensing is not required, an affidavit so stating has been presented
to document this statement;
      (3)   Is approved by the local agency responsible for providing support
services and/or programs to the facility;
      (4)   Will be designed, constructed, and maintained so that such use will
not change the general character of the area and operated in compliance with
relevant licensing or certification standards;
      (5)   Will not be within 1,500 feet of another community-oriented
residential social service facility or halfway house, unless this standard is
varied by the Board of Zoning Appeals to a lesser distance based upon stated
findings of fact;
      (6)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services; and
      (7)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be
designed to prevent any undo interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets.

Appeals provided that the applicant provides affidavits of 51% of the property
owners and resident freeholders within the above described radii, giving their
consent to the establishment of an adult entertainment facility, and if the
Board of Zoning Appeals determines:
      (1)   That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest
or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this
section will be observed;
      (2)   That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a skid row or similar depressed area;

acceptable to the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) and as approved
by the Municipal Engineer. The aisle or driveway shall not be used for the

residence may be counted as a parking space.
   (D)   Required yards. Structures and buildings containing off-street parking
shall be subject to the yard requirements applicable in the district in which
located. Off-street parking areas open to the sky may be located on any yard,
except that:
      (1)   In any residential zoning district or in the OR-1 office/
residential zoning district, off-street parking shall not be located in any
required yard;
      (2)   In any residential zoning district on a corner lot devoted to a
residential use, the off-street parking shall not be located closer to the side
lot line bounding a street than the minimum side yard width prescribed by the
development standards for the district; and
      (3)   If a lot is devoted to a nonresidential use and if its front lot
line, side lot line, or rear lot line separates the lot from a lot in a
residential district, the off-street parking facilities located thereon shall
not be closer to such lot line than the minimum front yard depth, side yard
width, or rear yard depth prescribed by the development standard for the
district.
   (E)   Location. All required parking spaces shall be located as follows:
      (1)   In any residential zoning district, on the same lot as the building
or use served;
      (2)   In a business district, on the same lot as the building or use
served, or a contiguous parcel, or within 400 feet of the principal structure;
and
      (3)   In any industrial district, on the same lot as the building or use
served, or a contiguous parcel, or within 1,000 feet of the nearest point of

business or industrial use shall be located in a residential district.
   (F)   Restricted parking lots - conditional use. Notwithstanding the
provisions of division (E) above, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the
use of land lying in a zoning district in which parking lots otherwise are not
a permissible use, as restricted parking lots, subject to the following:
      (1)   The approval of a restricted parking lot by the Board of Zoning
Appeals must be based on a finding that:
         (a)   The parcel to be used is located not more than 50 feet from the
parcel on which is located the land use requiring the parking facilities;
         (b)   The parking lot or parking lots shall be for use in connection
with a permissible use in an adjacent zoning district (whether the adjacent
district is within the territory subject to this zoning code or is within a
territory subject to the zoning restrictions of another zoning authority). The
parking lot shall be used solely for the parking of private passenger vehicles;
         (c)   The parking lot shall not be used for repair work or vehicle
servicing or loading of any kind, and no advertising signs of any kind shall be

97; Am. Ord. 2004-18, passed 1-4-05) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.233 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS TO OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   (A)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas having a vehicular use
area greater than 10,000 square feet in size shall be graded and constructed
having a minimum eight inches of #304 base overlain by at least two inches of
asphalt concrete on comparable all-weather surface acceptable to the Municipal
Engineer.
   (B)   Peripheral landscaping required. All open off-street parking areas
shall be separated from public sidewalks and street rights-of-way by a
landscaped strip at least ten feet in width, and a six-inch high barrier (curb)
shall be provided on the parking lot side of the landscape strip.
   (C)   Screening. When any open off-street parking area containing more than
five parking spaces is adjacent to a residential district, an effective buffer
or screen, consisting of a solid wall, fence, or dense living hedge shall be
provided at the lot line to protect the privacy of the adjoining residential
uses. This wall, fence, or hedge shall be not less than six feet in height
within side or rear yards and not more than three feet in height within a front
yard.
   (D)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be equipped with suitable shielding or be so designed as to prevent a
glare at eye level on surrounding public or private property.
   (E)   Interior landscaping required. No off-street parking areas shall be
constructed or enlarged until interior landscaping has been approved by the
village Planning Commission and installed.
      (1)   Landscape materials. The primary landscaping materials used in such
off-street parking areas shall be trees, which shall be eight feet to ten feet
in minimum overall height upon planting and which provide shade or are capable
of providing shade at maturity. Shrubbery, hedges, and other planting materials
may be used to complement the tree landscaping. A guide of planting types
deemed acceptable for landscaping purposes is on file in the office of the
Zoning Inspector and should be consulted prior to design of any parking
facility.
      (2)   Size of planting areas. The interior dimensions of any planting
area or planting median shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping
materials planted therein and to insure proper growth. In those instances where
plant material exists on a proposed parking facility prior to its development,
such landscape material may be used to meet the requirement of this zoning
code.
      (3)   Interior requirements. Within interior vehicular use areas 10,000
square feet or greater in size, and for each additional 10,000 square foot unit
or a proportional fraction thereof, a minimum total of 500 square feet of
landscape area shall be provided, irrespective of the peripheral requirements.
For individual parking lots with more than five parking spaces and less than
10,000 square feet in area, 5% of the vehicular use area, irrespective of the
perimeter requirements, shall be devoted to landscape. Planting which is
required for screening along peripheral areas of parking facilities shall not
be considered as part of the interior coverage requirement.
         (a)   Required trees. A minimum of two trees, each a minimum size of
1-3/4 inches in trunk diameter, shall be provided for each 10,000 square foot
unit of interior vehicular use area. The minimum distance from a tree to a
vehicular use area shall be four feet measured from the face of the tree.
         (b)   Location of interior landscape area.
            1.   The interior landscape area and trees required for each 10,000
square foot vehicular use area unit, or fraction thereof, shall be located
within that vehicular use area unit or fraction thereof. In areas where the
Zoning Inspector has determined that the strict application of this section
will interfere with the function of a vehicular use area, the unused portion of
the required interior landscaping shall be relocated, upon recommendation by
the Planning Commission, elsewhere on the property so as to emphasize a
landscaping feature.
            2.   In order that there shall be safe access to parking spaces,
landscaped strips shall be arranged so as to divide parking corridors and to
limit cross movements through open parking spaces. The minimum width of any
landscaped area shall be five feet.
         (c)   Credit for existing trees. If in the judgment of the Zoning
Inspector it is deemed appropriate, credit may be received on the interior
landscaping plan by preserving existing trees capable of tolerating adjacent
construction. In order to maintain any tree deemed eligible for credit, 100% of
the ground area under and within the drip line of the tree shall be preserved
from the trunk out to the edge of the drip line and shall be maintained in
either vegetative landscape material or pervious surface cover, except when the
Zoning Inspector determines that lesser areas and other ground cover treatment
will provide sufficient nourishment for the continued growth of the preserved
type of tree. The required number of new trees may be reduced in accordance
with the following schedule in exchange for preserving existing trees:
Diameter of Existing Crown Diameter of Tree Trunk of Number of Trees Credited
Spread of Preserved Tree1  Preserved Tree2
Diameter of Existing Crown Diameter of Tree Trunk of Number of Trees Credited

Editor's note:
   The code user should interpret the first two columns in the table above as
alternatives; for example, if either the diameter of existing crown spread of
a preserved tree is 90 feet or if the diameter of tree trunk of a preserved
tree is 35 inches or greater, then the number of trees credited will be 7.
 
   (F)   Drainage. All open off-street parking areas shall be provided with
adequate drainage facilities as approved by the Municipal Engineer. This
approval will not be required for off-street parking for single-family or two-
family uses.
   (G)   Maintenance. All parts of open off-street parking areas which are
landscaped shall be continuously maintained and kept in a well-manicured
condition.
   (H)   Marking. Designated parking spaces shall be marked on the surface of
the parking area with paint or permanent marking materials and maintained in
clearly visible condition.

§ 152.234 UNITS OF MEASUREMENT FOR PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   For the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements, the
following units of measurement shall apply:
   (A)   Floor area. Floor area for nonresidential purposes shall be the sum of
the gross horizontal area of all the floors of a building measured from the
exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the center line of walls
separating two buildings.
   (B)   Hospital bassinets. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as
beds.
   (C)   Places of public assembly.
      (1)   Benches. In stadiums, sports areas, churches, and other places of
assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews, or other similar
seating facilities, each 24 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted
as one seat for the purpose of determining the off-street parking requirements
of this zoning code.
      (2)   Fixed seats and assembly area. In cases where a place of assembly
has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be computed
separately for each type and added together.
   (D)   Fractions. When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to 1/2 shall be disregarded and fractions of over and including 1/
2 shall require one parking space.
('80 Code, § 152.234) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.235 ADDITIONS TO BUILDINGS AND EXTENSIONS OF LAND USE.
   (A)   Requirement. Whenever any addition to a building or extension of land
use results in an increase in the number of units used to measure required off-
street parking spaces, and the addition or extension creates a need for an
increase of more than 10% in the number of required off-street parking spaces,
additional off-street parking shall be provided on the basis of the increase in
the number of such units of measurement.
   (B)   Exception. In the case of additional dwelling units created by
conversion of an existing dwelling, one off-street parking space shall be
required for each additional dwelling unit so created.
('80 Code, § 152.235) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94) Penalty, see §
152.999
§ 152.236 MIXED OCCUPANCIES AND USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   In the cases of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking
facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately. Where a use is not specifically mentioned in §
152.231, the requirements for a use which is so mentioned and to which said use
is similar shall apply. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be
considered as providing requirements for any other use, except as specified for
joint use.

§ 152.237 COLLECTIVE PARKING AREA PROVISION.
   Nothing in §§
152.230 through
152.236 shall be construed to prevent collective provision of off-street
parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided that the total
of such off-street parking spaces supplied collectively shall not be less than
the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. However,
the requirements set forth in §
152.232 (E) as to maximum distances between parking areas and establishments
served shall apply to each establishment participating in the collective
provisions of parking.

NOISE REGULATIONS
§ 152.240 METHOD OF NOISE MEASUREMENT.
   (A)   For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, the
sound level meter, the octave band analyzer, and the impact noise analyzer
shall be employed. The flat network and the fast meter response of the sound
level meter shall be used. Sounds of short duration, as from forge hammers,
punch presses, and metal shears, which cannot be measured accurately with the
sound level meter shall be measured with the impact noise analyzer.
   (B)   Octave band analyzers calibrated in the Preferred Frequencies
(American Standards Association S1, 6-1960, Preferred Frequencies for
Acoustical Measurements) shall be used with Tables IA through ID, set forth in
§§
152.243 through
152.245.Octave band analyzers calibrated with pre-1960 octave band (American
Standards Association Z24-10-1953, Octave Band Filter Set) shall use Tables IIA
through IID) in §§
152.243 through
152.245. For impact sounds measured with the impact noise analyzer, the sound
pressure levels set forth in Tables I and II (A through D) may be increased by
six decibels in each octave band.
('80 Code, § 152.240) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.241 EXEMPTIONS TO NOISE REGULATIONS.
   The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the noise level
regulations:
   (A)   Noises not directly under the control of the property users;
   (B)   Noises emanating from construction and maintenance activities between
7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.;
   (C)   The noises of safety signals, warning devices, and emergency pressure
relief valves; and
   (D)   Transient noises of moving sources, such as automobiles, trucks,
airplanes, and railroads.
('80 Code, § 152.241) (Ord. 94-14, passed 7-5-94)
§ 152.242 REQUIRED PERFORMANCE LEVEL FOR NOISE.
   No operation or activity shall cause or create noise in excess of the sound
levels prescribed herewith.

§ 152.261 APPLICATION OF LAND USE INTENSITY RATING.
   (A)   The purpose of land use intensity is to relate land area and open
space to each other. In applying land use intensity, the floor area ratio
creates a maximum use of buildings in relation to land area, and the open space
requirements are minimum requirements based on and computed from the actual
floor area developed on a zoning lot. Where accessory or mixed uses are
involved, the open space requirement shall be based on floor area, other than
the used for commercial purposes. Recreation space (RS) may be a part of living
space (LS) and living space a part of open space (OS). The following is an
application of the ratios expressed in the foregoing section:
      (1)   Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The ratio of Floor Area (FA) to Land Area
(LA), expressed as a percent or decimal. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) x Land Area
(LA) = MAXIMUM PERMITTED FLOOR AREA.
      (2)   Open Space Ratio (OSR). The ratio of Open Space (OS) to Floor Area
(FA) that has been developed, expressed as a percent or decimal. Open Space
Ratio (OSR) x Floor Area (FA) = MINIMUM REQUIRED OPEN SPACE.
      (3)   Living Space Ratio (LSR). The ratio of Living Space (LS) to Floor
Area (FA) that has been developed, expressed as a percent or decimal. Living
Space Ratio (LSR) x Floor Area (FA) = MINIMUM REQUIRED LIVING SPACE WHICH MAY
BE PART OF REQUIRED OPEN SPACE (OS).
      (4)   Recreation Space Ratio (RSR). The ratio of Recreation Space (RS) to
Floor Area (FA) that has been developed, expressed as a percent or decimal.
Recreation Space Ratio (RSR) x Floor Area (FA) = MINIMUM REQUIRED RECREATION
SPACE WHICH MAY BE PART OF REQUIRED LIVING SPACE (LS).
   (B)   In determining land area, floor area, and open space, the following
method of computation shall be applicable:
      (1)   Land area. In determining land area, the following shall be
included:
         (a)   The area of the zoning lot, less any area for which vehicular
access has been granted to other properties; and
         (b)   An area equal to not more than 1/2 of the abutting right-of-way
of any public street or alley to which the zoning lot has vehicular access
rights. Said abutting right-of-way shall not include freeways, nor easements or
private streets, in which vehicular rights-of-way to other properties are
granted. On lots abutting intersecting streets, the area shall be determined by
the center line extensions of the abutting streets connecting with the lot line
extensions of the zoning lot.
      (2)   Floor area. In determining floor area, the areas of the several
floors of a building measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls, or
from the center line of walls separating two buildings, and all stairways,
balconies, and corridors shall be included. The following areas shall be
excluded:
         (a)   Attic area with headroom of less than seven feet;
         (b)   Storage rooms;
         (c)   Elevator hoist machinery;
         (d)   Cooling towers;
         (e)   Areas devoted exclusively to air-conditioning, ventilating, and
other building machinery and equipment; and
         (f)   Parking structures.
      (3)   Open space. In determining the area of open space, the following
shall be included:
         (a)   Land area as determined under division (B)(1), less the building
area; and
         (b)   Usable roof area.
      (4)   Living open space. In determining the area of living open space,
the following shall be included:
         (a)   Land area as determined under division (B)(1), less than
building area and less the area used for parking or maneuvering of vehicles;
and
         (b)   Usable roof area.
      (5)   Recreation space. In determining the area of recreation space, open
areas for both passive and active recreation facilities shall be included,
subject, however, to the following conditions:
         (a)   If the recreation space requirement is less than 10,000 square
feet, the recreation space, other than roof areas, shall be located in a
contiguous portion of the zoning lot; and
         (b)   If the recreation space requirement is 10,000 square feet or
more, each separate recreation area shall contain at least 10,000 square feet
and shall be not less than 100 feet in least dimensions at any point, except
for any spaces of less than 10,000 square feet constituting the remainder after
provision has been made for the 10,000-square-foot area or areas. Modification
of these area and dimensional requirements shall be allowed, if the shape or
topography of the site prevents compliance or if the recreation space consists
of usable roof area.

water supply, the Zoning Inspector, in accordance with R.C. § 713.13, is
authorized to:
         (a)   Cause cessation of the activity or use of the regulated
substance;
         (b)   Require the provision of administrative controls and/or
facilities sufficient to mitigate said danger; and/or
         (c)   Cause the provision of pollution control and/or abatement
activities.
      (2)   Considerations. When considering the exercise of any of the above
authorities or actions, the Zoning Inspector shall consult with the appropriate
administrative official of any potentially affected protected public water
supply. Such consultation shall determine what measures need to be taken to
ensure the public water supply is reasonably and adequately protected from
contamination for the present and the future. The Zoning Inspector may take
into consideration any evidence represented by the entity regarding cost
effectiveness and the economic effectiveness and the economic impact imposed by
the requirements or actions.
         (3)   Exemption of certain regulated substances. The Zoning Inspector

§ 153.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of wireless telecommunication facilities and
their support structures within appropriate areas of the municipality, in order
to protect the public health, safety and welfare, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications marketplace in the Miami Valley Region. Specifically, the
purposes of the chapter are:
      (1)   To protect residential areas and all land uses from potential
adverse impacts of towers and wireless telecommunications facilities, through
careful design, siting, landscaping and innovative disguising techniques.
      (2)   To promote and encourage shared use and co-location of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers.
      (3)   To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties caused by towers
and wireless telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are
soundly designed, constructed, and modified, are appropriately maintained, and
are fully removed when abandoned.
   (4)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that towers and wireless
telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses, and
are designed in harmony with natural settings and in a manner consistent with
current development patterns.
   (B)   All towers, antenna support structures, and wireless telecommunication
facilities, any portion of which are located within the corporate limits of the
municipality, are subject to this chapter. Except as provided in this chapter,
any use of an existing tower or antenna support structure on the effective date
of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming structure and allowed to
continue, even if in conflict with the terms of this chapter.
(Ord. 98-12, passed 5-19-98)
§ 153.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words, and
their derivations shall have the meanings given herein. Words not defined shall
be given their common and ordinary meaning.
   ADEQUATE COVERAGE. Coverage is considered to be "adequate" within that area
surrounding a WTF where the predicted or measured median field strength of
transmittal signal is greater than or equal to -95dbm for at least 75% of the
intended coverage area, it is acceptable for there to be holes within the area
of adequate coverage where the signal is less than -95dbm, as long as the
signal regains its strength to greater than or equal to - 95dbm further away
from the WTF. For the limited purpose of determining whether the use of a
repeater is necessary or desirable, there shall be deemed not to be adequate
coverage within said holes. The outer boundary of the area of adequate
coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain a
strength of greater than or equal to -95dbm.
   ADEQUATE CAPACITY. Capacity is considered to be "adequate" if the Grade of
Service (GOS) is p.05 or better for median traffic levels offered during the
typical busy hour, as assessed by direct measurement of the personal wireless
service facility in question. The GOS shall be determined by the use of
standard Erlang B calculations. As call blocking may occur in either the land
line or radio portions of a wireless network, adequate capacity for this
chapter shall apply only to the capacity of the radio components.
   ANTENNA. Any panel, whip, dish, or other apparatus designed for
communications through the sending and receiving of electromagnetic waves,
excluding any support structure other than brackets.
      (1)   ANTENNA, PERSONAL USE. Any antenna and earth satellite dishes
designed only to receive AM and FM radio, CB radio, television, and satellite
television broadcast transmissions and receive and transmit amateur radio
signals, for the use and enjoyment of the property owner. Such uses are an
accessory use of the property and shall be governed by provisions specified in
this chapter and
Chapter 152.
   ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE.  Any building or other structure other than a

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.101 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The Village of New Lebanon, Ohio is vitally concerned with the use of
the various rights of way in the municipality as such rights of way are a
valuable and limited resource which must be utilized to promote the public
health, safety and welfare including the economic development of the
municipality.
   (B)   Changes in the utilities and communication industries have increased
the demand and need for access to public rights of way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
   (C)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the public rights of way to promote efficiency,
lessen the public inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights of way, and
promote public safety.
   (D)   In recognition of the limited space available in the municipality
rights of way, the municipality shall promote the collocation of utilities to
minimize intrusions into the rights of way.
   (E)   While not a principal purpose of this chapter, an ingredient or
component of this ordinance is to protect the public welfare by protecting real
estate from impairment and destruction of value by taking into account
aesthetic considerations in the requirement by the municipality, when in the
opinion of the municipality practical, of the underground placement of any
element of a public or private utility system located in the public rights of
way.
   (F)   The municipality has rights under the laws and constitution of the
State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4, and 7,
to regulate public and private entities which use the public rights of way.

the rights of way in the most advanced mapping format and in as much detail as
currently available to the provider. Following that initial provision of
information and upon the reasonable request of the Municipal Manager, which
request shall not occur more than once annually, every provider shall provide
to the municipality, in the most advanced mapping format and in as much detail

(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.306 RESPONSIBILITIES OF A UTILITY SERVICE PROVIDER WITH A VALID
CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   When required by this code, a utility service provider with a valid
Certificate of Registration must obtain a Revocable Street Privilege Permit.
   (B)   The provider must keep all the information required in the application
by the municipality current.
   (C)   When requested by the municipality, a public or private utility
service provider, with a utility system element located or proposed to be
located in a public right of way in the municipality, must meet with the
municipality to coordinate future plans for the public right of way between the
utility service provider and the municipality.
   (D)   A utility service provider with any utility system element located or
proposed to be located in a right of way in the municipality must provide the
municipality with up-to-date accurate plans in sufficient detail and in a
format acceptable to the municipality showing the location of all elements of
the utility system located in the right of way in the municipality.
   (E)   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, providers shall obtain
any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
federal, state and local authorities and, upon the municipality’s reasonable
request, shall provide copies of such documents to the municipality.
   (F)   A Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable,
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the municipality or under the management or control of
another utility provider that is legally occupying the municipality right of
way.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.307 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights of way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights of way in the municipality for the limited
purpose and for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration
and in accordance with this chapter and any associated permit. For those
providers with a valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a
Certificate of Registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall
not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights of way that may have
been granted by such franchise. The rights to occupy the right of way itself
may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more
providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights of way so
long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the municipality’s facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider’s system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this chapter and other applicable law.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.308 RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   A provider must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for
seasonal working conditions, permanently remove and relocate its equipment and
facilities in the right of way whenever the Municipal Manager requests such
removal and relocation, and shall restore the right of way to the same
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. The Municipal Manager
may make such request to prevent interference by the provider’s equipment or
facilities with:
      (1)   A present or future municipality use of the right of way,
      (2)   A public improvement undertaken by the municipality,
      (3)   An economic development project in which the municipality has an
interest or investment,
      (4)   When the public health, safety and welfare require it, or
      (5)   When necessary to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the right of way.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider shall not be required to
remove or relocate its equipment from any right of way which has been vacated
in favor of a non-municipality entity unless and until the reasonable costs
thereof are first paid to the provider therefor.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.309 PRE-EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT LOCATION.
   Before the start date of any right of way excavation, each provider who has
equipment in the area to be excavated shall contact OUPS and shall mark the
horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all said equipment. Any
provider whose equipment is estimated to be less than 20 inches below a
concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor to establish the exact location of its equipment and the best
procedure for excavation.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.310 DAMAGE TO OTHER EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   When the municipality does or causes to be done work in the right of
way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider’s equipment
to protect it, the Municipal Manager shall notify the provider representative
as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be
billed to that provider and must be paid within 30 days from the date of
billing.
   (B)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the right of way that it or its equipment damages. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of
another provider caused during the municipality’s response to an emergency
occasioned by that provider’s equipment.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.311 RIGHT OF WAY VACATION.
   (A)   If the municipality vacates a right of way which contains the
equipment of a provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of
the provider’s equipment, the municipality shall reserve, to and for itself and
all providers having equipment in the vacated right of way, the right to
install, maintain and operate any equipment in the vacated right of way and to
enter upon such right of way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing,
inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.
   (B)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider’s equipment;
and:
      (1)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the
provider must pay the relocation costs; or
      (2)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the municipality, the
provider must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the
municipality and the provider; or
      (3)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the provider, such other person or persons must pay the relocation
costs.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.312 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ABANDONED EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Discontinued operations. A provider who has determined to discontinue
its operations in the municipality must either:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the Municipal Manager that the
provider’s obligations for its equipment in the right of way under this chapter
have been lawfully assumed by another provider; or
      (2)   Submit to the Municipal Manager a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the municipality. If a provider
proceeds under this §
154.312(A)(2), the municipality may, at its option: purchase the equipment;
require the provider, at its own expense, to remove it; or require the provider
to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the municipality for
reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.
   (B)   Abandoned equipment.
      (1)   Equipment of a provider who fails to comply with the discontinued
operations provisions of this chapter and which remains unused shall be deemed
to be abandoned. Unused equipment means facilities located in the rights of way
to which all of the following apply:
         (a)   The facilities have remained unused for a period of two years;
         (b)   The provider is unable present to the municipality a credible
plan detailing the procedure by which the provider intends to begin actively
using such facilities within the next 12 months;
         (c)   The provider has no potential purchaser or user of the
facilities who will be actively using the facilities within the next 12 months;
and
         (d)   The availability of such facilities is not required by the
provider to adequately and efficiently operate its system.
      (2)   Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The municipality
may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but
not limited to:
         (a)   Abating the nuisance;
         (b)   Taking possession of the equipment and restoring it to a useable
condition; or
         (c)   Requiring removal of the equipment by the provider, or the
provider’s successor in interest.
   (C)   Removal. Any provider who has unused and abandoned equipment in any
right of way shall remove it from that right of way during the next scheduled
excavation, or at such different time as designated by the Municipal Manager,
unless this requirement is waived by the Municipal Manager. In the event of any
conflict with the provisions of this §
154.312 with the federal law known as the Miller Act, being 40 USC 270a - 270f,
the provisions of the Miller Act shall control and prevail.

any and all utilization of the public rights of way or rights of way, including
excavation, construction, installation or maintenance of any public or private
utility, roadway, street or any other facility, structure, driveway, culvert,

other easements of the municipality.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.502 PERMIT APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Applications for a right of way utilization permit, accompanied by the
appropriate fee, as established by the municipality, shall be submitted to the
Municipal Manager. The application shall be on a form approved and designated
by the Municipal Manager and in accordance with the procedure established by
the Municipal Manager. The Municipal Manager shall, upon request for a right of
way utilization permit application, provide to the applicant a copy of the
current right of way utilization application and procedures. Applications for
access to a state right of way shall be submitted to the appropriate office of
the State of Ohio Department of Transportation, and applications for access to
a Montgomery County right of way shall be submitted to the appropriate office
of Montgomery County, Ohio prior to obtaining a municipal right of way
utilization permit. All right of way utilization permits shall meet the
specifications and guidelines set forth by the Municipal Manager.
   (B)   The requirements in this chapter shall be in addition to any
requirement set forth in Chapters
151 and
152 of this code.
   (C)   A utility service provider must have a valid Certificate of
Registration on file with the municipality, or be exempt under §
154.206 before the municipality may issue a Revocable Street Privilege Permit.
   (D)   When practical, in the opinion of the municipality, the policy of the
municipality is to require the underground location of a new utility system
element in the public right of way.
   (E)   The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a utility
system in a public right of way by a utility service provider must be
accomplished in a practical manner that, in the opinion of the municipality,
results in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public
right of way.
   (F)   The applicant shall provide a specific timetable within which the
permit work shall be accomplished; detailed plans; accurate scale drawings;
and, specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the municipality to
describe the area of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the
municipality may require the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate,
comprehensive master plans of the existing and proposed utility system. These
master plans are intended to allow the municipality to consider the broader
context of the utility service provider’s plans upon which the permit
application is based.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.503 LIMITATIONS ON PLACEMENT OF UTILITY SYSTEM ELEMENTS AND/OR PERMISSIVE
DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   (A)   To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in recognition of
the limitation of space in the public right of way, the Municipal Manager shall
have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of a new utility system or
additional elements of an existing utility system within a public right of way
if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of persons to
occupy and use the public right of way. In making such decisions, the Municipal
Manager shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and
potential users of the public right of way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public’s needs for the particular
utility service, the needs of the property owners of the municipality for the
particular utility service, the condition of the public right of way, the time
of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing
elements of utility systems in the public right of way, and future municipality
plans for public improvements and development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest.
   (B)   The Municipal Manager may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the public right of way, or when necessary to protect the
public right of way and its users. The Municipal Manager, in his or her
discretion, may consider one of more of the following factors: the extent to
which public right of way space where the permit is sought is available; the
competing demands for the particular space in the right of way; the
availability of other locations in the public right of way or in other public
rights of way for the utility system elements of the permit applicant; the
applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right of way that affect
location of utility system elements in the right of way; the degree of
compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise,
this chapter, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of
disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the
use of that part of the public right of way; the condition and age of the
public right of way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial
reconstruction; the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and
damage to the public right of way against the benefits to that part of the
public served by the expansion into additional parts of the public right of
way; and the feasibility of accomplishing the desired goal outside of the
public right of way.

INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY
§ 154.601 MUNICIPALITY DOES NOT ACCEPT LIABILITY.
   By reason of the acceptance of an application or the grant of a permit, the
municipality does not assume any liability for injuries to persons, damage to
property, or loss of service claims or for claims or penalties of any sort
resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of
facilities.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.602 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with
the municipality a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a provider is
required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the municipality’s
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising
out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or
operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a
rights of way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by a permit, excepting only negligent acts or omissions
that are willful and wanton or intentional torts and for which immunity is not
provided by the Ohio Revised Code for such acts, omissions, or intentional
torts. This exception shall not extend to acts, omissions, or intentional torts
occurring as a result of or in response to an emergency. A provider further
agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or
other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the
municipality’s agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and
subcontractors or any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a rights of way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This chapter is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider or to the municipality; and the provider, in defending any action on
behalf of the municipality, if allowable by law, shall be entitled to assert in
any action every defense or immunity that the municipality could assert in its
own behalf. Any and all exercises of the above shall be consistent with, but
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, each provider shall, at its
sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
municipality, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers
and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including
without limitation worker’s compensation claims against the municipality or
others), causes of action, liability, and judgments for injury or damages
including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the municipality related to the following:
         (a)   Injuries or damages to persons or property, in any way arising
out of or through the acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents
or employees attributable to the occupation by the provider of the rights of
way, to which provider’s negligence shall in any way contribute, and regardless
of whether the municipality’s negligence or the negligence of any other party
shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or
damage.
         (b)   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of a person, firm or corporation, or the violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or
any other right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, by
excluding claims arising out of or related to municipality programming.
         (c)    Arising out of provider’s failure to comply with the provisions
of any law applicable to the provider.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the municipality:
         (a)    Giving the provider reasonable notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         (b)    Affording the provider the opportunity to fully participate in
any discussions concerning any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or
disposition of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification, as well as
the sole right to approve any compromise or settlement or financial commitment,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;
         (c)    Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available
to the provider all pertinent information under the municipality’s control.
   (B)   The municipality shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and
defense thereof, and the provider shall pay all reasonable fees and expense of
such separate counsel if employed.

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND RIGHTS OF APPEAL
§ 154.701 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION.
   It shall be unlawful to violate any provision of this chapter. Violation of
any provision of this chapter or failure to comply with any requirement of this
chapter (including a violation of a condition or safeguard established in
connection with a Certificate of Registration, permit, or any other
municipality approval) shall constitute a misdemeanor of the second degree.
Each and every failure to comply shall be considered a distinct and separate
offense. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a distinct and
separate offense.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.702 NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive or in lieu of other
rights and remedies that the municipality may have. The municipality is hereby
authorized at any time to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or
threatened injury to the rights of way, including damages to the rights of way,
whether caused by a violation or any of the provisions of this chapter or other
provisions of applicable law.
(Ord. 2000-06, passed 7-6-00)
§ 154.703 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter, and the remedy
of specific performance that may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Municipal Manager may assess an additional penalty of civil
forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Said
penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the municipality, in the amount of
$500 per 24 hour day of violation and any subsequent portion of a day less than
24 hours in length. Prior to assessing said penalty, the Municipal Manager
shall provide written notice to the provider detailing the failure to comply
with a specific provision of this chapter. Said notice shall indicate that said
penalty shall be assessed 15 calendar days after receipt of service of the
notice if compliance is not achieved. If a provider desires to challenge said
penalty, the provider shall request a hearing before the Municipal Manager
within ten days of service of the notice. Said hearing shall be held within 30
days of the provider’s request. If the provider requests such hearing before
the Municipal Manager, said penalty shall be temporarily suspended. If,
however, after the hearing, the Municipal Manager determines that the provider
failed to comply with the specific provision of this chapter referenced in the
notice, said penalty shall be assessed starting 15 calendar days after service
of the notice referenced in this chapter and continuing for each day thereafter
until compliance is achieved. The determination of the Municipal Manager shall
be final.
