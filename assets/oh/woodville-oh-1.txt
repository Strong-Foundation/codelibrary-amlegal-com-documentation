EDITOR'S NOTE
    The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Woodville Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Woodville Codified Ordinances is indicated.

         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

constitutes a potential threat to other trees within the Village. The Tree
Commission shall notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be
done by the owners at their own expense within ninety days after the date of
service of notice.

wire, other than one used to support a young or broken tree, or attach or place
any sign, poster, handbill or other thing to any tree growing in a public
place, or cause or permit any wire charged with electricity to come in contact
with any such tree, or allow any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which is
harmful to such trees to come in contact with their roots or leaves.
(Ord. 11-91. Passed 5-6-91.)
   151.19 ARBORISTS LICENSE AND BOND.

pruning, treating or removing Street or Park Trees within the Village without
first applying for and procuring a license. The license fee shall be twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) annually in advance, provided, however, that no license
shall be required of any public service company or Village employee during such
work in the pursuit of their public service endeavors.
   (b)   Before any license shall be issued, each applicant shall first file
evidence of possession of liability insurance in the minimum amounts of one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for bodily injury and one hundred thousand

STREET TREE CULTIVAR RECOMMENDATIONS
   The following tree cultivars are recommended for planting in tree lawn or
downtown planting sites where stress from compaction, pedestrian abuse,
pollution etc., has previously killed other types of trees. The trees listed
below have been used successfully in many communities. However, please remember
that the success of any tree planting depends upon the individual planting
sites as well as the tree.
   For specific information about any of the trees for our particular planting
sites, please contact the Division of Forestry or a member of the Ohio
Nurserymen's Association.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
               Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date." Rule 13 provides that a court
shall establish a traffic violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions
as to the designated offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver
payment in lieu of court appearance.

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §
3301-35-08, a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s
pupils certifying that the school meets state minimum standards for

the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
 
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been

R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender

shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this

   335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;or duty that the person is capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)

      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.

an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:

conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug

   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor     Maximum Fine  
First degree            $ 5000.00
Second degree           4000.00

Minor misdemeanor not
specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

         (Ord. 8-2015. Passed 8-10-15.)
   (b)   The rates and charges set forth in subsection (a) hereof are hereby
established and the Village Administrator is hereby authorized to make and
collect such rates and charges in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein.
(Ord. 29-2010. Passed 11-22-10.)
   (c)   The funds received from the collection of the aforesaid rates and
charges shall be deposited as received with the Fiscal Officer of the Village
who shall keep the same in a separate fund designated as the "Waterworks
Revenue Fund", subject to the provisions of any ordinance or indenture of
mortgage authorizing the issuance of, and securing, mortgage revenue bonds of
the utility. Subject to the provisions of any such ordinance or indenture of
mortgage, moneys so deposited shall be used for the payment of the cost and
expense of operation, maintenance, repair and management of the utility and for
payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on and other charges on
bonds and notes issued for improvement of, and extensions to, the utility, and
any surplus in such Fund over and above the requirements hereinbefore mentioned
may be used for enlargements of and replacements to, the utility and parts
thereof or for any other lawful utility purpose.
   (d)   All meters shall be read monthly, and all users shall be billed not
later than the fifteenth day of each month for their usage of water during the
preceding calendar month. If access to a user's meter is unobtainable for a
timely reading during a certain month, that user's usage during that month
shall be estimated by the Village Works Administrator, based on the actual
usage during the same calendar month in previous years or on the actual usage
during previous months. Upon the request of any party to the transfer of title
of property to which service is provided or his agent, made at least fourteen
days prior to the transfer, the meter at that property shall be read and a
final bill for all outstanding charges shall be rendered within ten days
following such request. Upon the request of any user, the Village Works
Administrator shall test the user's meter within ten days after such request.
   (e)   All bills shall be due and payable by the last day of the month during
which the bill is rendered. If the bill is paid by the last day of the month
during which it is rendered, payment of the "net bill", consisting of the
billed charges, shall constitute payment in full. If the bill is not paid by
the last day of the month during which it is rendered, payment of the "gross
bill", consisting of the billed charges plus ten percent (10%) thereof, shall
constitute payment in full. The ten percent (10%) penalty shall be added to the
billed charges for a certain month only once and shall not be computed on the
amount of any previous ten percent (10%) penalty. Prior to any certification of
the amount of a gross bill to the County Auditor in accordance with subsection
(g) hereof, any partial payment in the amount of ten dollars ($10.00) or more
shall be accepted as a partial payment.
   (f)   Any user may request a meeting with the Village Works Administrator to
dispute the amount of a bill within seven days after the bill is rendered. Such
meeting shall be held within seven days after such request. If the dispute is
not resolved, the user may request a hearing by the Board, provided that:
      (1)   The request is made within seven days after the meeting with the
Village Works Administrator; and
      (2)   The disputed bill is paid in full prior to such request.
   The hearing shall be held at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting
but in no event later than thirty days following the request therefor. If the
Board determines that the amount of the disputed bill is to be reduced, the
amount of such reduction shall be credited, first, against any outstanding bill
of that user and, second, against the next bill rendered to that user.
   (g)   Any user who fails to pay a bill by the date the next bill is to be
rendered, and who has so failed in the past on at least three separate
occasions, shall be sent a shut-off notice with such succeeding bill. Any other
user who fails to pay a bill by the date the second succeeding bill is to be
rendered shall be sent a shut-off notice with such succeeding bill. If such
user fails to pay all outstanding bills in full or make arrangements with the
Village Works Administrator for the payment of all outstanding bills by the due
date, and a call is made by the Village Works Administrator within three days
to collect such bill, an additional ten dollars ($10.00) trip charge will be
made. If payment is not made or arrangements made at this time, service will be
terminated and shall be resumed only upon payment in full of all outstanding
bills and a twenty dollar ($20.00) reconnection charge.
   (h)   This Board, in its discretion, may certify to the County Auditor any
charges which have been due and unpaid for at least sixty days, together with
any penalties thereon; provided that:
      (1)   The unpaid charges have arisen pursuant to a service contract made
directly with the owner of the property served by the connection, and
      (2)   Written notice of such impending certification has been sent to the
owner of the property at least thirty days prior to the certification;
provided, if the Board determines that a transfer of the property served is
about to occur, any overdue charges may be certified forthwith to the County
Auditor. Upon such certification, the County Auditor shall place the certified
amount on the real property tax list and duplicate against the property served
by the connection. The amount certified shall be a lien on such property from
the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be collected in the same
manner as other taxes, except that payment in such amount shall be accepted by
the County Treasurer when separately tendered as payment for the full amount of
unpaid charges and penalties thereon. The lien shall be released immediately
upon payment of the certified amount.
   (i)   The Board, in its discretion, may collect charges not paid when due by
actions at law in the name of the Village.
   (j)   Unless certified to the County Auditor in accordance with subsection
(h) hereof, bills shall be payable at the office of the Fiscal Officer of the
Village or at the offices of Huntington National Bank and First Federal Bank
located within the Village.
(Res. 18-86. Passed 9-30-86.)
   921.03 BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Village Works Administrator, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Village Works Administrator will give notice to the water consumer
to install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at
his own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Village Works Administrator and shall have inspections and
tests made of such approved devices as required by the Village Works
Administrator.
   (b)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the Village of Woodville may enter the supply or distributing
system of said municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water
supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been
approved by the Village Works Administrator and by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
   (c)   It shall be the duty of the Village Works Administrator to cause
surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served
by the public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public
water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter
of public record and shall be repeated as often as the Village Works
Administrator shall deem necessary.
   (d)   The Village Works Administrator or his or its duly authorized
representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the Village for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or
systems thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the Village Works Administrator any information which
he may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Village Works Administrator, be deemed evidence of the
presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Village Works Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this section.

(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1109.06 DISTRICT MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map which is made a
part of this Zoning Ordinance, which map is designated as the "District Map".
The District Map and all of the notations, references and other information
shown thereon, are a part of this Zoning Ordinance and have the same force and
effect as if the District Map and all of the notations, references and other
information shown thereon were all fully set forth or described herein, the
original of which District Map is properly attested and is on file with
Council.
   (b)   No changes of any nature shall be made on the official Map of the
Village, after the date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, except in
conformity with the procedures set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.

(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1109.07 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   The district boundary lines on such map are intended to follow either
centerlines of streets or alleys or lot lines; and where the districts
designated on the Map are bounded approximately by such street, alley or lot
lines, the street or alley or lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of
the district unless such boundary is otherwise indicated on the Map. In the
case of unsubdivided property, the district boundary line shall be determined
by the use of the scale appearing on the Zoning District Map or by dimensions.
In the case of the vacation of a street, alley, watercourse or other right of
way, the abutting zoning classification on each side thereof shall
automatically be extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley,
watercourse or right of way.
   (b)   Where boundaries appear to approximately follow such aforesaid lines
and are not more than ten feet distant therefrom, such lines shall be construed
to be the boundary lines unless specifically shown otherwise.

   1137.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Until recent years the regulation of all uses of land and structures
through zoning has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use
districts. However, the functions and characteristics of an increasing number
of new kinds of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of
the older, familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable
procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community. It
should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the
nature, magnitude and location of such types of land use activities are many
and varied, and are dependent upon the functional characteristics of the use,
competitive situations and the availability of land. Certain kinds of uses need
to be reasonably controlled by specific requirements that provide practical
latitude for the investor but at the same time, maintain adequate provision for
the security of the health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or general
welfare of the community's inhabitants.
   (b)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made in
this Zoning Ordinance for a more detailed consideration of each conditionally
permitted use as it relates to location, design, size, method of operation and
intensity of land use, which in turn affects the volume of traffic generated
and traffic movements, the concentration of population and the kinds of public
facilities and services it requires. Land and structure uses possessing these
particularly unique characteristics are designated as conditionally permitted
uses and are permitted through the issuance of a conditional zoning certificate
with conditions and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the
protection of the public welfare.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1137.02 PROCEDURES FOR MAKING APPLICATION.
   (a)   Application Data. Application shall be submitted to the Zoning Board
of Appeals and it shall contain the following data:
      (1)   The form supplied by the Zoning Board of Appeals completed by the
applicant.
      (2)   A site plan, plot plan or development plan of the entire property
being considered, drawn to a reasonable scale and showing the location of all
abutting streets, the location of all existing and proposed structures, the
types of buildings and the uses proposed.
      (3)   The fee payment for conditional zoning certificates shall be
submitted with the application and in accordance with the fee structure
established by the Board of Township Trustees.
   (b)   Review by Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
review the proposed development as presented on the submitted plans and
specifications in terms of the standards established in this Zoning Ordinance.
Such review shall be completed and made public within forty-five days.
   (c)   Hearing. After adequate review and study of any application the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing or hearings upon every application
after at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation, at least
ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Such notices shall indicate the
place, time and subject of the hearing.
   (d)   Reapplication. No application for a conditional zoning certificate
which had been denied wholly or in part by the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be
resubmitted until the expiration of one year or more from the date of such
denial, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof of changed
conditions which would be sufficient to justify reconsideration by the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
   (e)   Issuance and Revocation of Conditional Zoning Certificate. Only upon
conclusion of hearing procedures relative to a particular application may the
Zoning Board of Appeals issue a conditional zoning certificate. The breach of
any condition, safeguard or requirement shall automatically invalidate the
certificate granted, and shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
Such violation shall be punishable as specified in this Ordinance.
   (f)   Approval of Plans for Conditional Zoning Certificate. No conditional
zoning certificate shall be issued for the use of the land in any district
unless the plans have been approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Board
of Zoning Appeals may refer plans submitted to the Zoning Commission for its
comments and recommendations and may formally consider such recommendations
prior to approval or disapproval of the plan.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1137.03 STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall establishes beyond reasonable doubt that
both the general standards and the specific requirements pertinent to each
conditional use indicated herein shall be satisfied by the establishment and
operation of the proposed conditional use. The Zoning Board of Appeals may also
impose such additional conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary for the
general welfare, for the protection of individual property rights and for
ensuring that the intent and objectives of this Zoning Ordinance will be
observed.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1137.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence that such use of the proposed location:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives
or with any specific objective of the comprehensive plan;
   (b)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such a use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
   (c)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (d)   Will not be detrimental to property in the immediate vicinity or to
the community as a whole;
   (e)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services;
   (f)   Will be in compliance with the Subdivision Regulations, the Board of
Health Standards and the Building Code if there are such requirements;
   (g)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall require as conditions of approval any
other requirements, including guarantees that any conditions will be fulfilled,
that it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance.

1105.02(100)
   1141.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Define the legal status of buildings or land uses which do not conform
to this Zoning Ordinance but which were in operation prior to the enactment of
this Zoning Ordinance; and
   (b)   To provide either for the conversion of nonconforming uses into
conforming uses as soon as reasonably possible or for their eventual and
equitable elimination.
      (Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1141.02 REGULATIONS.
   The lawful use of any building or land existing prior to the enactment of
this Zoning Ordinance may be continued, although such use does not conform with
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance; however, to achieve the purposes of
this section the following regulations shall apply:
   (a)   Expansion. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use may
be altered, improved or reconstructed provided such work is not to an extent
exceeding thirty percent (30%) total increase in the size of the nonconforming
building or structure.
   (b)   Restoration. Whenever a building, the use of which does not conform to
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion or act
of God, it may be restored to its original dimensions if reconstructed within
eighteen months for residences and their accessory buildings/uses and twenty-
four months for all other structures.
   (c)   Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, but the
extension of a lawful use to any portion of a building or structure shall be
permitted when approved by the Board of Appeals.
   (d)   Displacement. No nonconforming use shall displace a conforming use.
   (e)   Change in Use. No nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use unless the Board of Appeals determines that the proposed
nonconforming use is in the same zoning district uses as the prior
nonconforming use or in the uses listed as permitted in a more restricted
zoning district. Public hearing, notices, etc., are required.
   (f)   Discontinuance and Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has been
discontinued for a period of two years or more, such discontinuance shall be
considered legal abandonment of the nonconforming use. At the end of that two
year period, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established, and any further
use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (g)   A Change of Zoning Districts. Whenever the boundaries of a district
shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another of a
different classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any
nonconforming use existing therein.
   (h)   Construction Approval Prior to Zoning Ordinance. Nothing in this
Zoning Ordinance shall prohibit the completion of the construction and use of
nonconforming buildings for which construction was commenced before the
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance provided that the construction is carried on
diligently and without interruption and that the entire building shall have
been completed within two years after the beginning of construction.
   (i)   Nonconforming Conditional Uses. Uses existing prior to the enactment
of this Zoning Ordinance which are listed as conditional uses in the district
in which they are located shall be considered as nonconforming uses until a
conditional zoning certificate has been applied for and issued for such use.

use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing types, a higher
level of urban amenities and the preservation of natural scenic qualities of
open spaces.
   (b)   Conflict With Other Sections. Whenever there is a conflict or
difference between the provisions of this section and those of other sections
of this Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
   (c)   Permitted Uses. Residential and commercial uses only shall be
permitted in this district provided that all pertinent requirements are met or

type residential development within the PUD District.
   (f)   Lot, setback and building requirements of the R-3 Multi-Family
Residential District shall apply to all other multiple-family type residential
developments. However, to permit the efficient design of common open space
areas:

(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1145.03 COMMERCIAL USES.
   Commercial uses and buildings may be included within the proposed PUD. The
permitted uses and lot, building and setback requirements found in the C-
2 Highway and General Commercial District shall apply to the commercial uses
and buildings in the PUD District. In addition, the following design standards
shall apply:
   (a)   The commercial uses and structures shall be clustered to provide
common parking and ingress and egress points to reduce the number of
intersections.
   (b)   Any combination of screens and landscaping shall be provided on the
perimeter of the commercial areas abutting on any residential areas.
   (c)   The commercial areas shall be provided with adequate and properly
arranged facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping and other
such features and facilities necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient for the residential development. The design of the structures shall
be harmonious with the design of the residential areas within the PUD.

improvement shall be landscaped or maintained in a neat and orderly manner as
specified by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Variations from the lot, setback and building requirements may be
permitted when necessary to allow for a more efficient design of the proposed
PUD. However, each foot of building height over the maximum height regulations
shall cause the required distance between the building and the side and rear
property line of the PUD District to be increased by one foot.
      (Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1145.04 PUD APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (a)   The PUD approval process, as a combined zoning amendment and
subdivision approval, consists of the following steps:
      (1)   Submission of completed application, materials and fees to the
office of the Zoning Inspector.
      (2)   Approval of the PUD concept plan by the Planning Commission. The
approval of the concept plan constitutes the preliminary plat approval.
      (3)   Approval of the PUD site development plan by the Planning
Commission. The approval of the site development plan constitutes a
recommendation of the Township Trustees of approval of the proposed zoning
amendment.
      (4)   Approval of the site development plan by the Township Trustees.
Approval of the site development plan is also the final plat approval; approval
also creates the PUD District.
      (5)   Issuance of the zoning certificates by the Zoning Inspector in
accordance with the approved site development plan.
   (b)   Applications for PUD approval may be obtained from the Zoning
Inspector, and when completed, three copies of the application and the PUD
concept plan shall be returned to the Zoning Inspector. The application shall
consist of the application form, the required fees, material required for an
application for a zoning amendment, the material required for preliminary plat
approval, and in addition the following material which shall constitute the PUD
concept plan:
      (1)   Location of different general land use areas proposed to be
developed;
      (2)   Proposed density levels of each residential area, excluding common
open spaces;
      (3)   Proposed treatment of existing topography, drainage ways and tree
cover;
      (4)   Time schedule of projected development, if the total landholding is
to be developed in stages, or if construction is to extend beyond a two-year
period; and
      (5)   Any other materials or information requested by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall adhere to the procedures found in
Chapter
1163 in preparing the recommendation concerning the PUD site development plan.
The process begins with the application and concept plan and is completed with
the recommendation to the Township Trustees concerning the site development
plan.
   (d)   The Planning Commission, in order to approve the concept plan, must
determine that:
      (1)   The relaxation of the conventional zoning standards is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated into the proposal and are
consistent with intent and purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Township but could
not be accomplished using the conventional zoning standards; and
      (2)   The provisions of Sections
1145.01 through
1145.04 where appropriate, have been met.
      (3)   Approval of the PUD concept plan shall also be considered as the
preliminary plat approval.
   (e)   The approval of the PUD concept plan and the preliminary plat shall
remain in effect for a period of two years from the date of approval. They
shall become null and void unless the PUD site development plan for the first
section of the planned unit landholding has been formally approved by the
Planning Commission within that two year period.
   (f)   Once the PUD concept plan has been approved by the Planning
Commission, the owner/developer shall submit three copies of the PUD site
development plan to the Planning Commission for their approval, approval with
modifications, or denial. The PUD site development plan shall bear the
signature of a professional engineer and shall be in accordance with the
approved concept plan. The site development plan shall contain:
      (1)   A survey of the tract to be developed showing existing physical
features such as general topography, drainage ways, tree cover, street,
easements and utility lines; and
      (2)   Preliminary building plans, including floor plans and exterior
elevations.
   (g)   Prior to approval of the site development plan, the Planning
Commission must determine that:
      (1)   The proposed PUD site development plan is in compliance with the
approved PUD concept plan;
      (2)   Any part of the PUD District not used for structures, parking and
loading areas, or streets, including those areas that are proposed for future
development, shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
      (3)   All requirements of Sections
1145.01 through
1145.04 are met.
   (h)   The Planning Commission shall submit its recommendation to the
Trustees within three days after its approval of the PUD site development plan.
The Trustees shall approve, approve with modifications, or deny the site
development plan within sixty days of receipt.
      (1)   Trustee approval of the site development plan shall be considered
as the final plat approval.
      (2)   Trustee approval of the site development plan shall also be
considered as approval of the PUD Zoning Amendment.
   (i)   The Trustees shall adhere to the procedures found in Chapter
1163.
   (j)   Prior to granting approval of the site development plan, the Trustees
shall be satisfied that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   That the PUD District is in conformance with the comprehensive plan
for the County;
      (2)   That each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development can exist as an independent unit and that the uses proposed will
have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved with conventional zoning;
      (3)   That the internal street and major and minor streets that are
proposed shall properly interconnect with the surrounding existing major and
minor streets as designated on the official thoroughfare plan of the County;
      (4)   That the minimum common open space area has been designated and
shall be duly transferred to a legally established home owner's association or
at the request of the Trustees has been dedicated to, and accepted by the
Township.
      (5)   That the PUD site development plan is consistent with the intent
and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, to promote public health, safety and
general welfare of the residents of the Township.
   (k)   In taking action, the Trustees may deny the PUD site development plan
or may recommend approval of the plan subject to specified conditions. Approval
of the PUD site development plan shall constitute the creation of a separate
Planned Unit Development Zoning District.
   (l)   At the time of adopting any ordinance establishing a PUD District and
approving the site development plan, the Trustees shall make appropriate
arrangements with the owner/developer which will ensure the accomplishment of
the public improvements and reservation of common open space as shown on the
approved PUD site development plan.
   (m)   Zoning certificates shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector and shall
be required for each individual structure. Zoning certificates shall be issued
only in compliance with the approved PUD site development plan.
   (n)   If no construction has begun within two years after approval of the
site development plan, it becomes null and void.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1145.05 AMENDMENTS TO THE APPROVED SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (a)   Minor changes in the location, siting or character of the buildings
and structures may be authorized by the Zoning Inspector. No change authorized
by the Zoning Inspector under this section may alter the size of any building
or structure by more than ten percent (10%), nor change the location of any
building or structure by more than ten feet in any direction provided that all
other maximum or minimum requirements are met. All changes authorized by the
Zoning Inspector must be reported to the Planning Commission at the meeting
immediately following such authorization.
   (b)   All other changes in the approved site development plan must obtain
Planning Commission and Trustee approval. The process shall begin at Section
1145.04(a)(2). If the Planning Commission determines that the amended site
development plan still complies with the approved concept plan, the process
shall proceed from Section
1145.04(a)(3).
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1145.06 SUBDIVISION OF AN APPROVED PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   All future subdivisions of a completed PUD shall be first reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission to assure that each subdivided area of the
development includes the parking, open space and other similar necessary
requirements.
   (b)   Subdivision approval shall comply with the Subdivision Regulations of
Sandusky County, Ohio.

   1159.01 INTENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL; VARIANCE.
   (a)   Administrative Appeal. The administrative appeal procedure is
instituted to allow any person or any official of the Village, aggrieved by a
decision of the Zoning Inspector during the administration or enforcement of
this Zoning Ordinance, the opportunity to have the Board of Zoning Appeals
review that decision. The Board shall determine whether or not the decision was
in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Variance. The variance procedure is instituted to allow the Board of
Zoning Appeals the authority to grant a variation from the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interests and where
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of these provisions would
result in an unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands,
structures or buildings in the same district shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1159.02 PROCEDURE FOR PRESENTING AN APPEAL OR AN APPLICATION FOR A VARIANCE.
   (a)   To initiate either procedure, the Zoning Inspector or the person
authorized to administer the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall have
taken an action involving the administration or enforcement of this Ordinance.
      (1)   Administration appeal. An administrative appeal may be filed only
if the following conditions are met:
         A.   The Zoning Inspector has decided to issue or deny a certificate;
that an activity is in violation of this Zoning Ordinance; that a certificate
is or is not required; or any similar decision.
         B.   The appeal is based upon an interpretation of the requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
         C.   The party filing the appeal is an official or citizen of the
Village who believes that the interpretation is in error.
         D.   The appeal has been filed within ten days after the decision.
      (2)   Variance. A variance may be filed only if the following conditions
are met:
         A.   The Zoning Inspector has denied the application for a zoning
certificate.
         B.   The denial is based upon the applicant's inability to meet or
exceed the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
         C.   The application has been filed within twenty days of the
decision.
   (b)   Applications for administrative appeals or variances are available at
the office of the Village Zoning Inspector and when completed are to be
returned to that office. The applications for administrative appeals and
variances shall include but not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
      (2)   Location of the property and the zoning district including the
inlot number;
      (3)   Present and proposed uses;
      (4)   If required by the Zoning Inspector, a vicinity map and plat layout
containing information required by the Zoning Inspector;
      (5)   A statement identifying the decision which is being appealed or the
variance requested and the reason for the request; and
      (6)   A fee as established by Council.
   (c)   Within three working days after the completed application or appeal
has been filed it shall be transmitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Within
forty day of receiving an application for a variance only, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hold a public hearing to consider the application. No public
hearing shall be held for an administrative appeal. Notice of the public
hearing shall be given not less then ten days prior to the date of the hearing
by publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Village. A notice shall also be sent to the applicant and may be posted at the
property in question. In addition, notice shall be sent to all property owners
within 200 feet of the property requesting the variance. The distance shall be
measured from the nearest property line.
   (d)   The Board shall decide on the application within sixty days after
receipt by the office of the Zoning Inspector. The filing of an administrative
appeal shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals
that, by reason of the facts presented in the application, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life and property.
   (e)   The Board of Zoning Appeals:
      (1)   Administrative appeals: shall reverse, affirm or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination that is being administratively appealed.
The decision shall, in the opinion of the Board, reflect conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Variances: shall grant, deny or modify the variance application.
The variance shall not be granted unless the following conditions exist:
         A.   The special circumstances apply to the applicant's building(s) or
land(s) and do not generally apply to other buildings or lands in the same
zoning district.
         B.   The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of
the applicant.
         C.   The literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
property owners in the same zoning district.
         D.   The variance will provide the minimum necessary relief and will
represent the least possible modification.

feet from the point of intersection of such centerline with any public road or

   1167.01 NOTICE.
   The Zoning Inspector shall give written notice, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by other means, to ensure actual notice to persons
responsible for the alleged violation. Such notice shall state the reasons why
the Zoning Inspector believes there is a violation in fact and shall require an
answer or a correction of the alleged violation, as determined by the Zoning
Inspector, within a reasonable time limit set by the Zoning Inspector. The
notice shall also state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or
correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector
within the set time limit constitutes an admission of the violation.
(Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1167.02 RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The manner in which persons responsible for an alleged violation of this
Zoning Code respond to the notice of violation shall determine the course of
action taken by the Zoning Inspector as follows:
   (a)   Correction of Violation Within Time Limit. If, within the time limit
set, the alleged violation is corrected, as determined by the Zoning Inspector,
he or shall note "violation corrected" on his or her copy of the notice and
retain it among his or her records.
   (b)   Petition for Administrative Review. If, within the time limit set,
persons responsible for the alleged violation petition the Zoning Board of
Appeals for an administrative review to determine whether or not there is an
error by the Zoning Inspector in regard to the interpretation of this Zoning
Code, then no legal action shall be initiated by the Village against those
responsible for the alleged violation until after the Board has made its
determination.
   (c)   Request for Extension of Time. If a reply is received within the time
limit set indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected, but that more
time is required than was granted by the original notice, the Zoning Inspector
may grant an extension of time, if he or she deems such extension will not, in
his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life, health or property. In acting
on such a request, the Zoning Inspector shall, in writing, state his or her
reasons for granting or refusing to grant the extension and shall transmit the
same by certified mail, return receipt requested, or other means to ensure
actual notice, to those to whom original notice was sent.
   (d)   No Correction; No Reply. If there is no reply within the time limit
set, thus establishing an admission of the violation, and the alleged violation
is not corrected to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector within the time
limit set, he or she shall take or cause to be taken such action as is
warranted by the continuation of an admitted violation.
      (Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1167.03 PROSECUTION OF VIOLATION.
   If the notice of violation is not complied with nor an appeal proceeding
started within fifteen days of the service of notice, the Zoning Inspector
shall request the legal counsel of the Village to institute the appropriate
proceeding at law and/or in equity against the person responsible for such
violation, ordering such person to:
   (a)   Restrain, correct or abate such violation;
   (b)   Remove or terminate the unlawful use of the parcel of land or building
or other structure in violation;
   (c)   Remove the work in violation;

   (e)   Enforce the penalty provisions of this Zoning Code against the person
responsible for the violation.

enforcement of this Zoning Code;

promulgated under this Zoning Code or other applicable law, conceal such
violation.
      (Ord. 13-87. Passed 7-27-87.)
   1167.05 NUISANCES; ABATEMENT.
   Buildings erected, altered, razed or converted, or uses carried on in
violation of this Zoning Code are hereby declared to be nuisances per se. The
Village may petition the courts to order the nuisance abated. The owner or

1187, shall apply to improvements to be constructed in any plat within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.02 SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Five of the Planning and Zoning Code shall be known and may be
cited as the "Subdivision Regulations for the Village of Woodville, Sandusky
County, Ohio" and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these Regulations".
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.03 PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION.
   The purpose of these Regulations and rules shall be to guide and regulate
the planning, subdividing and development of land in order to promote and
protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
Village. The provisions of these Regulations shall be the minimum requirements.
Whenever these provisions are different from the requirements of other lawfully
adopted regulations or probate deed restrictions, the more restrictive rule or
higher standard shall govern. It is intended that the provisions of these
Regulations shall be applied to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)    Secure and provide well-planned subdivisions in order to preserve the
public health and safety, thereby providing orderly, efficient, integrated
development in accordance with established County and Village policies and
plans. This includes the proper arrangement of streets or other highways in
relation to existing or planned streets or highways, the Sandusky County
Regional Development Plan, or the general plans of the Woodville Village and
Township.
   (b)    Establish minimum uniform standards for subdivision design; provide
requirements for planned unit developments; establish minimum engineering
criteria and performance guarantees, as well as providing for environmental
factors.
   (c)    Give assurance that:
      (1)    Adequate water supplies, storm drainage and sewerage facilities
can be provided; and
      (2)    Open spaces to permit access for utilities are provided;
      (3)    Traffic, to include fire fighting and other emergency vehicles,
has been addressed; and
      (4)    Maintenance of light, air, and minimal congestion of population
has been considered.
   (d)    Preserve the natural beauty of the land; protect the vegetative cover
of natural areas; prevent surface water, subsurface water, air, noise, and
visual pollution; regulate development in areas of geological and topographical
hazards (including but not limited to flood plains, shorelines, areas of
unstable or expansive soils and excessive slopes or slope areas); protect
against loss or injury from inappropriate use of the land; and otherwise help
preserve and enhance both the safety and the quality of the environment.
      (Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These Regulations shall be effective following adoption by Council.
Henceforth, any other subdivision regulations previously adopted by the Village
of Woodville, Sandusky County, shall be deemed to be repealed.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.05 SCOPE AND VALIDITY.
   These Regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations. Nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with any existing provisions of other laws,
or regulations, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations. If any
section, clause, phrase, word, provision or portion of these Regulations shall
be held to be unconstitutional or invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding or decision shall not effect the validity of these
Regulations as a whole, or any other part other than the section, clause,
phrase, word, provision or portion that is ruled invalid. Where these
Regulations impose a greater restriction upon land than that which is imposed
or required by such existing provisions of law, these Regulations shall
control.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.06 AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION.

approve, or disapprove plats or subdivisions of land falling within their
jurisdiction.
   (b)    The Village Planning Commission is authorized to administer these
Regulations, except where specific authority is delegated to some other Village
office as established by these Regulations within all areas under the
jurisdiction of the Commission.
   (c)    The Planning Commission and an appropriate Village office may serve a
written notice, or order by personal service or certified mail, upon the person
responsible whenever evidence reflects that work is being done or any
transaction is being made in violation of a submitted and approved detailed
statement or plan. Such notice shall direct the discontinuance of any illegal
action and the remedying of the condition that is in violation of the
provisions and requirements of these Regulations.
      (1)    The person served with the written notice may request an
appearance and/or hearing before the Planning Commission. The decision of the
Planning Commission may be appealed by either the person served the written
notice or the department or office involved. This appeal must be made before
the appropriate court.
      (2)    In case such notice or order is not promptly complied with, the
enforcement officer of the appropriate department or office shall notify the
other public offices and other officials concerned therewith and shall request
the same to withhold their approval and issue a stop work order.
      (3)    The enforcement officer of the appropriate agency, in any case,
may also request the Village legal advisor to institute the appropriate legal
proceedings.
   (d)    The planned unit development approach to development is greatly
encouraged. These Regulations may be modified by the degree necessary to
accomplish the objectives and standards required by the planned unit
development of residential, commercial or industrial subdivisions, or a mixture
thereof, in accordance with Article IX of the zoning (ordinance #22-74)

approved via these Regulations.
   (c)    All proposed subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the Village
shall conform to the applicable zoning regulations.

final plans, all in accordance with Chapters

1187.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1181.08 DEED TRANSFER; MINOR SUBDIVISION (LOT SPLITS).

private water wells may be used within a subdivision in lieu of a public water
supply distribution system when it can be reasonably shown that such wells will
be properly installed, located and properly isolated from all possible sources
of contamination. In determining such factors, the regulations and/or laws in
effect by the Ohio Department of Health, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency,
Ohio Department of Natural Resources or the local Board of Health shall be
employed by the subdivider or developer. No individual water wells shall be
provided within a subdivision without the expressed written approval of the
regulatory agency having jurisdiction.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1187.08 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)    Location of sanitary sewers within a right of way shall be approved
by the Village Engineer. All subdivisions shall be served by the extension of

(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1187.10 IMPROVEMENTS BOND.
   The improvements and standards therefor described in this chapter have been
adopted by the Village at a meeting on November 15, 1993 and no final or
official submittal of any subdivision shall be approved unless the improvements
listed in the sections of this chapter have been satisfactorily completed prior
to such approval or the subdivider shall file with the Village Attorney a
surety bond, cashier's or certified check, the amount and character of which
shall be approved by the Village Engineer, for improvements. This bond
guaranteeing to the Village that such improvements will be constructed and
completed in a satisfactory manner and within a period specified by the Village
Engineer, but such period shall not exceed two years. Such bond or checks shall
be approved by the Village Attorney and shall be made payable to, and

systems, park areas or other physical facilities necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit and which are of
such character that the Village or other public agency does not desire to
maintain them, then provisions shall be made by trust agreements, which are a
part of the deed restrictions and which are acceptable to the Planning
Commission and the Village and/or County Sanitary Engineer or acting Sanitary
Engineer for the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such
facilities by the lot owners in the subdivisions.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1187.12 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
minimum required improvements of Chapter

      Inspection of streets and acceptance - see Ohio R.C. 711.08, 711.09
   1189.01 GENERAL.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major, secondary
and minor streets or highways shall conform with the provisions of these
Regulations. Other streets shall conform to the recommendation of the Village
Planning Commission based on existing and planned streets, topography, public
safety and convenience and proposed uses of land.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1189.02 STREETS.
   (a)    Design and Arrangement. 
      (1)    The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provision for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
area (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided)
insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public requirements. All stub
streets shall be improved with a two-foot buffer strip which is unimproved and
includes a proper reflective guard rail and posts per ODOT standards. Every
subdivision shall have access to a public right of way, as required by Ohio
R.C. 5553.02.
      (2)    The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so
designed as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be
avoided.
      (3)    The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten (10) degrees from a right angle. All other
streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible and no
intersection of streets at angles of less than seventy (70) degrees shall be
permitted.
      (4)    Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through
traffic which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin
and destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending
for considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (b)    Alignment. 
      (1)   Vertical. For main thoroughfares profile grades shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty times the algebraic
difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred; for
secondary and minor streets and alleys, fifteen times.
      (2)    Minimum horizontal. Radii of centerline curvature:
 
Main thoroughfares      12 degrees 475 ft.
Secondary thoroughfares 19 degrees 300 ft.
Minor streets           28 degrees 200 ft.
         A minimum fifty foot tangent shall be introduced between reverse
curves.
      (3)    Visibility requirements.
         A.    Minimum vertical visibility (measured four and one-half feet eye
level to tail light eighteen inches above ground level).
 
1000 ft. on main thoroughfares
500 ft. on secondary thoroughfares
200 ft. on minor streets
         B.    Minimum horizontal visibility shall be:
 
500 ft. on main thoroughfares measured on centerline
300 ft. on secondary thoroughfares measured on centerline
200 ft. on all other streets measured on centerline
   (c)    Street and Alley Width. 
      (1)    The width of all major thoroughfares shall be a minimum of sixty-
six feet or as may be specified in a thoroughfare plan.
      (2)    The minimum right-of-way widths of all other streets shall be
sixty-six feet.
      (3)    The minimum width of right of way in single- and two-family
districts shall be sixty-six feet and the pavement width shall be twenty-six
feet, except where there are unusual topographical or other physical
conditions, the Village Planning Commission may require a greater width for a
minor street. The right-of-way width of minor streets serving multiple
dwellings shall be sixty-six feet and the pavement width shall be twenty-six
feet.
      (4)    Dedication of half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street or alley exists adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
      (5)    Alleys shall not be permitted in single- or two-family districts.
They may, however, be required in multiple dwelling developments where they
should have a minimum right-of-way width of twelve feet. Alleys are required in
the rear of all commercial and industrial lots, if no other provisions are made
for adequate service access or for parking. The rights of way of such alleys
shall be not less than twenty feet and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
   (d)    Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall require 120 foot diameter right of way
with 100 foot diameter pavement and maximum length of 600 feet. Islands shall
not be permitted.
   (e)    Dead-end Streets. Dead-end streets, designated to be so permanently,
shall not be permitted.
   (f)    Street Grades. Street grades shall not be less than one-tenth of one
percent (.1%) and shall not exceed the following width due allowances for
reasonable vertical curves.
 
Main or arterial highway       5%
Secondary thoroughfares       6%
Minor streets and alleys       8%
   (g)    Easements. Easements of at least ten feet in width shall be provided
on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary,
for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Additional width may be required for
necessary access to the utility involved. Easements may also be required along
or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may necessitate
the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights of way. For
lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should consist of
straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection. Easements along
rear lot lines should be twenty feet where control of the property is outside
of the subdivision.
   (h)    Block. No block shall be longer than 800 feet nor less than 400 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
   (i)    Lots. 
      (1)    The lot arrangement and design shall be such that sublots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
      (2)    All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines
and radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will
provide a better street and sublot layout. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
      (3)    No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the
Village zoning regulation applying to the area in which it is located.
      (4)    Lots which cannot reasonably be served by a public or private
sanitary sewer and are not within reasonable distance of a public or private
water supply main, shall have a minimum width of 100 feet, measured at the
building line and a minimum area of 20,000 square feet or as may be required by
regulations of the Board of Health.
      (5)    In case of soil conditions or other physical factors which may
impair the health, welfare and safety of the neighborhood in which the
subdivision may be located, upon recommendation of the Sandusky County Board of
Health or Village Engineer, the Commission may require large lot widths and lot
areas as deemed necessary.
      (6)    No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy- five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a
street may be designated the front of a sublot, provided the rear yard shall
always be opposite the frontage so designated. Setbacks for residential corner
lots shall be thirty-five feet minimum in both directions unless existing homes
adjacent to the corner lot are less and development would be inconsistent. This
would require concurrence by the Planning Commission.
      (7)    All corner lots, be they at the intersection of the rights of way
of two streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a curve with a minimum
radius of twenty feet joining the two sidelines of such rights of way.
      (8)    Orientation of all homes will be parallel to right-of-way lines
except at cul- de-sacs where orientation shall be radial.
   (j)    Street Names. Where new names are required for new streets in
unincorporated areas, the names shall meet with the approval of the Planning
Commission. Continuations of existing streets shall carry the identical name as
the existing street.
   (k)    Acceptance of Streets. 
      (1)    The approval of a plat by the Planning Commission shall not be
deemed to be an acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or
highway dedicated in such plat, per Ohio R.C. 711.041.
      (2)    The Planning Commission shall, upon written request by the owner
of the land upon which the street has been constructed, instruct the Village
Engineer to check the construction and if the Village Engineer finds that such
street has been constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth on
the approved plat, and that such street is in good repair, then the Planning
Commission may recommend acceptance of the street for public use by Council
(Ohio R.C. 711.091). Posting of a one-year maintenance bond, letter of credit
or performance bond shall be required prior to Village acceptance.
         (Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1189.03 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Building Lines. 
      (1)    Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control and is to be
used for residential purposes, the building lines shall be established at a
minimum of thirty-five feet from the road or street right of way.
      (2)    Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than the above may be
required for commercial and industrial uses as determined by the Planning
Commission.
   (b)    Easements. Easements of at least ten feet in width shall be provided
on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary,
for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Easements may also be required along
or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may necessitate
the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights of way. For
lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should consist of
straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection.
(Ord. 22-93. Passed 11-15-93.)
   1189.04 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)    Easement Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide a permanent easement dedicated to the proper authority for the
purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream
for drainage of public use. The width of such easement shall be as determined
by the Village Engineer.
   (b)    Land Subject to Flooding or Containing Poor Drainage Facilities. The
right is reserved to disapprove any subdivision which is subject to periodic
flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities. The 100-year
flood plain, floodway elevations and contours shall be shown on the preliminary
drawings. However, if the subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will
make the area completely safe for residential occupancy, the subdivision may be
approved, subject, however, to approval of the Village Engineer and Planning
Commission.
   (c)    Parks and Open Spaces. 
      (1)    Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding scenic,
historic and cultural features as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (2)    If a subdivider divides ten or more acres in a subdivision, the
Village shall require one of the following options:
         A.    Where parcels are greater than thirty acres, the developer will
dedicate a minimum of five percent (5%) of the net area of the subdivision as
open space. The dedicated area shall meet with the approval of the Park Board
or, where parcels are less than thirty acres or where the Planning Commission
determines that it would prefer, the developer shall:
         B.    Donate a fee equivalent to five percent (5%) of the fair market
value of the land for acquisition of open space and recreation purposes.
      (3)    If adjacent land is subdivided, the sum of all areas subdivided
after adoption of the revisions to the Subdivision Regulations, will form the
total acreage of the subdivision.
      (4)    Any lands that have been dedicated to open space purposes through
this program may be transferred to suitable public park agencies, non-profit
homeowners' and renters' associations or the Sandusky County Board of Park
Commissioners, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, subject to
acceptance by the receptive agency, with the provisions that the recipient
agency shall be responsible for the maintenance appropriate to the designated
lands.

   1305.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of Woodville, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Woodville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Woodville as identified in Section
1305.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Village of Woodville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   The “Flood Insurance Study Sandusky County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” effective April 18, 2011.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Sandusky Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
effective April 18, 2011.
       (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of Woodville, Ohio Municipal Utility
Building, 530 Lime Street, Woodville, Ohio 43469.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 6-
2011. Passed 3-28-11.)
   1305.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.” See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Fremont’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
   “Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)” means a revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   “Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)” means a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   “Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)” means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial Flood Regulations effective
date, April 16, 1987, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Fremont’s flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1305.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1305.04(c).

1305.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development that increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1305.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Woodville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Woodville have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Woodville’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village’s boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Woodville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1305.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1305.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Woodville and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1305.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Fremont specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1305.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Critical Development.  
      (1)   Critical development is that which is critical to the community’s
public health and safety, are essential to the orderly functioning of a
community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials,
or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or
injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools,
fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants,
and gas/oil/propane storage facilities.
      (2)   Critical developments shall be elevated to the 500-year flood
elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where
records are available), whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing
the 500- year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation,
the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (k)   Fill. The following standards apply to all fill activities in special
flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal.
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided.
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
   (l)   Storage of Materials. Storage of material or equipment not otherwise
prohibited in Section
1305.05(a)(2) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotations.
      (Ord. 6-2011. Passed 3-28-11.)
   1305.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   Council shall appoint the Zoning Appeals Board as established in
Section
 1151.02 to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations.
      (2)   The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the
vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of all official
actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the office of
the Fiscal Officer.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1305.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance may be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Village.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on
all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1305.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 6-2011. Passed 3-28-11.)
   1305.06  ENFORCEMENT.

      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1305.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that

occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village shall prosecute any violation of these
regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
