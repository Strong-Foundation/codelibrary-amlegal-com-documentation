DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
 
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Martins Ferry, Ohio, has had the matter
of recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some
time, and
 
   WHEREAS, the Model Cities Department of the City has heretofore entered into
a contract with the Walter H. Drane Company to prepare and publish such
recodification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MARTINS FERRY,
STATE OF OHIO:
 
   Section I. That the ordinances of the City of Martins Ferry, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Martins Ferry,
Ohio, 1972.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Martins
Ferry, Ohio.
 
   Section II. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to May 18, 1972,
which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other

cause to be published in a manner required by law a summary of the new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate
that the section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
 
   Section IV. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
and safety of the residents of the City of Martins Ferry, Ohio, and for the
further reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and
avoid practical and legal entanglements. Therefore, provided this Ordinance
receives the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the elected or appointed members of

approval by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect and be in force at the
earliest time allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

sections hereafter enacted in lieu thereof; and unless otherwise provided,
whenever a reference to a section or group of sections is made in any amendment
or supplement to any section of the Codified Ordinances hereafter enacted, such
reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended.

violation of any provision of the section or sections included in such
reference.

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

repeal the conflicting provisions.

101.09 KEEPING CODIFICATION UP TO DATE.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.

181.01 NECESSITY OF URBAN RENEWAL.
   It is hereby determined that within the City there exist slum, blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this chapter
which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimical to the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents. The
existence of such areas:
   (a)    Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime, and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection, and for other public services
and facilities;
   (b)    Constitutes an economic and social liability; and
   (c)    Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community,
retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems
and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities.
   This menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory processes and
exercise of the police power, and cannot be dealt with effectively by the
ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids provided in this
chapter. The elimination in whole or in part of slum, blighted, deteriorated
and deteriorating areas, and the prevention of occurrence or recurrence of such
areas by redevelopment and by the conservation, rehabilitation and
reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of the salvageable portions of such
areas, and by other activities pursuant to urban redevelopment or urban renewal
as defined in this chapter, are public uses and purposes for which public money
may be expended and private property acquired by purchase, by donation and by
eminent domain and are governmental functions of concern to the City, and
require the exercise of the powers of government granted to the City by the
provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. The necessity in the
public interest and general welfare, for the provisions of this chapter is
hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.02 COUNCIL POLICY.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of Council to promote and encourage
the sound development, including renewal and redevelopment where necessary, of
the entire City in accordance with the General Plan for the City. Council
realizes that the City Government will be unable to carry out coordinated and
effective programs for renewing the City without the cooperation and support of
the public as a whole. Therefore, Council stands ready to cooperate with
private enterprise, civic groups, neighborhood agencies and governmental
agencies in developing and carrying out urban renewal programs and projects to
promote the sound development of new areas, to prevent the spread of slums and
blight and to eliminate slums, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas
in the City.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the meanings ascribed
to them in this section unless a different meaning is clearly indicated in the
context.
   (a)    "Agency" or "urban renewal agency" or "local public agency" or "City"
means the City of Martins Ferry.
   (b)    "Slum, blighted or deteriorated area" means an area within the
corporate limits of the City in which there are a majority of structures or
other improvements, which, by reason of dilapidation, deterioration, age or
obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation or
open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary
conditions or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by
fire or other hazards and causes, or any combination of such factors, and an
area with overcrowding or improper location of structures on the land,
excessive dwelling unit density, detrimental land uses or conditions, unsafe,
congested, poorly designed streets or inadequate public facilities or
utilities, all of which substantially impair the sound growth and planning of
the community, is conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant
mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime, and is detrimental to the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (c)    "Deteriorating area" means either:
       (1)    An area, whether predominantly built up or open, which is not a
slum, blighted or deteriorated area but which, because of incompatible land
uses, nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking facilities, faulty street
arrangement, obsolete platting, inadequate community and public utilities,
diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, increased density of population
without commensurate increases in new residential buildings and community
facilities, high turnover in residential or commercial occupancy, lack of
maintenance and repair of buildings, or any combination thereof, is detrimental
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and which will
deteriorate, or is in danger of deteriorating, into a slum, blighted or
deteriorated area, or
      (2)    An area consisting principally of land in highways, railway
tracks, bridge or tunnel entrances, or other similar facilities which have a
blighting influence on the surrounding area and over which air right sites can
be developed thereby eliminating such blighting influence.
   (d)    “Project area” or "urban redevelopment area" or "urban renewal area"
means a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area or any combination
or part thereof which Council designates as of a character and size appropriate
for urban renewal activities and for which an urban redevelopment plan or urban
renewal plan is proposed or prepared.
   (e)    "General neighborhood renewal area" means an urban renewal area of
such scope that urban renewal activities therein have to be carried out in more
than one separate urban renewal project, over an estimated period of up to ten
years.

City, with or without Federal or State aid or assistance, for developing,
undertaking and carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment programs and

connection therewith, or any part of such activities.
   (g)    "Open space land" means land which has not been developed by the
construction or installation of streets, utilities, buildings, except sporadic
or incidental structures, or other site improvements. Whether or not such an
area has been platted in whole or in part does not prevent its classification
as "open space land."
   (h)    "Redeveloper" means any person or entity purchasing property from the
City within a project area, or owning property located within such an area and
entering into a conforming agreement with the City in consideration for which

exists from time to time for the urban renewal or redevelopment of a general
neighborhood renewal area. The general neighborhood renewal plan need not
contain all of the required contents set forth in Section
181.06 with respect to an urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan.
Approval of the general neighborhood renewal plan by Council does not create
authority to carry out project execution activities.
   (k)    "Urban renewal project", "urban redevelopment project" or "project"
means undertakings and activities of the City, with or without Federal or State
aid or assistance, in a project area for the elimination and for the prevention

areas, and may involve clearance and redevelopment in a project area, or
rehabilitation and conservation in a project area, or any combination or part
thereof, in accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan for
the project area to the full extent of and in accordance with the rights,
powers and authority of the City, whether derived from the applicable

welfare, or otherwise to remove or prevent the spread of blight or
deterioration, or to provide land for needed public facilities; and disposition
of property, so acquired in accordance with this paragraph for voluntary repair
and rehabilitation of buildings or other improvements in accordance with the

repaired or rehabilitated for dwelling use or related facilities, provided,
that there shall not be acquired for such purposes, in any project area,
buildings which contain or will contain more than 100 dwelling units, or five
percent of the total number of dwelling units in the area which, under the
urban renewal plan, are to be repaired or rehabilitated, whichever is the
lesser. The urban renewal project shall not include the construction or
improvement by the City of any building other than municipal buildings, except
as provided in paragraph (7) of this subsection and this paragraph (8).
   (l)    "General Plan" or "Master Plan" generally means a broad and general
guide and pattern for the future growth and development of the City including
maps, plats, charts and descriptive, interpretive and analytical narratives, as

181.04 MAYOR TO SUPERVISE RENEWAL AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.
   The Mayor is hereby charged with the responsibility of supervising the urban
renewal and urban redevelopment activities of this City, coordinating the
activities of the several officers, employees, commissions and boards concerned
with such projects and executing on behalf of the City, as its authorized

(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.05 PREPARATION OF PLAN.
   (a)    Upon the recommendation of the Mayor and approval by the Planning

this section have been prepared, they shall be submitted to Council and filed
as provided from time to time.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.06 CONTENTS OF PLAN.
   (a)    Any urban renewal or redevelopment plan hereafter prepared shall be
prepared in such detail as to clearly set forth sufficient information to
permit the Planning Commission to exercise its power of approval or disapproval
under Ohio R.C. 713.02, and in any event such plans shall include, but not be

displaced from the project area, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings equal in
number to the number of such displaced families, and available to them and
reasonably accessible to their places of employment.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.07 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    When a general neighborhood renewal plan or an urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan and the supporting documentation therefor is filed with
Council, Council shall refer the plan and supporting documentation to the
Planning Commission of the City for its review and recommendations including
the exercise of its power of approval or disapproval under Ohio R.C. 713.02,
and its certification as to whether or not the plan is in conformity with the
General Plan of the City, by causing a copy of the plan and supporting
documentation to be delivered to the person charged with the preparation and
custody of the record of proceedings of the Planning Commission.
 
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval or recommendations concerning the plan. The approval of the Commission
shall also constitute its approval of those matters placed under its
jurisdiction by Ohio R.C. 713.02, except as the recommendations of the Planning
Commission may include a disapproval pursuant to that section. Except as
recommendations or disapprovals are received from the Planning Commission on or
before the thirtieth day after the day of delivery to the person charged with
the preparation and custody of the record of proceedings of the Planning
Commission of such plan and supporting documentation, the plan shall be
conclusively presumed to have been approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
 
181.08 PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)    Council, before approving a general neighborhood renewal plan or an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, shall hold a public hearing on the
plan at which an opportunity shall be provided to all interested persons to be
heard either in person or by counsel, which hearing may be adjourned from time
to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing will be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for two
consecutive weeks on the same day of the week, and at least seven full days
shall elapse between the second publication and the date set for the public
hearing. The notice shall also contain a description of the project area by its
location in relation to highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or
artificial boundaries, and shall also designate the place at which the plan,
maps, plats and other materials describing the project area are and will be
available for public inspection.
 
   (b)    Following the completion of the public hearing, Council may either
approve or reject the general neighborhood renewal plan or the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan, or make modifications and approve the plan as
modified; provided that:
      (1)    If the boundaries of the project area are extended to include any
land (except land contained within the right-of-way lines of a dedicated street
or alley) not included in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon
which the public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, or if
there is added a type of urban renewal or redevelopment activity not included
in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing
was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof which requires the acquisition of
property or if there is any change in land use or redevelopment restrictions
contained in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the
public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a public hearing
shall be held on the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan as modified
prior to the approval thereof by Council in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (a) hereof; and
      (2)    If such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the general neighborhood renewal
plan or urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan as modified shall be
resubmitted to the Planning Commission for its written approval or
recommendations pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07 .
   
   (c)    When Council wishes to approve a general neighborhood renewal plan,
or an urban renewal or redevelopment plan, it shall do so by ordinance passed
by not less than a majority vote, after reading in full on three separate days
or under suspension of rules pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.17; provided, however,
that if the plan has not been approved by the Planning Commission, or if there
were any partial disapprovals by or adverse recommendations of the Planning
Commission under Ohio R.C. 713.02, not accepted by Council by its modifications
of the plan in accordance therewith, then an affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the members of Council shall be required to pass the ordinance and, to the
extent that such disapproval involves the construction of an improvement or
utility within the meaning of Ohio R.C. 713.02, the concurrence of the head of
the department or departments having control of the construction of such
proposed improvement or utility shall also be necessary.
 
   (d)    The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal
plan should contain a finding that the plan conforms to the general plan and to
the workable program of the City and such other findings as may be necessary or
desirable, but need not contain the other findings set forth in subsection (e)
hereof for approval of urban renewal or redevelopment plans. Such approval of a
general neighborhood renewal plan may be made before or at the same time as the
approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan for a project within the
general neighborhood renewal area.
 
   (e)    The ordinance of Council approving an urban renewal or redevelopment
plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)    Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area
which make it a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, and
findings that the project area is a slum, blighted, deteriorated or
deteriorating area;
      (2)    That the size and character of the area and the location of
elements of slum, blight and deterioration in the area make it appropriate for
urban renewal activities;
      (3)    That the proposals for the proper relocation of individuals and
families displaced in carrying out the project in decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings in conformity with acceptable standards are feasible and can be
reasonably and timely effected to permit the proper prosecution and completion
of the project; and that such dwellings or dwelling units available or to be
made available to such displaced individuals and families are at least equal in
number to the number of displaced individuals and families, are not generally
less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities than the dwellings of the displaced individuals and families in the
project area, are available at rents or prices within the financial means of
the displaced individuals and families, and are reasonably accessible to their
places of employment;
      (4)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is needed: That
financial aid to be provided by the Federal Government under its contract is
necessary to enable the project to be undertaken in accordance with the plan;
      (5)    That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise;
      (6)    That the plan conforms to the existing General Plan for the
overall development of the City as prepared by the Planning Commission pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 713. 02;
      (7)    That the plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities, as may be desirable for
neighborhood improvement, with special consideration for the health, safety and
welfare of the children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by
the plan;
      (8)    This finding is to be made only if there is included in the plan
any provision permitting the new construction of hotels, motels or other
housing for transient use: That the City has caused to be made a competent
independent analysis of the local supply of transient housing and as a result
determines that there exists a need for additional units of such housing in the
project area;
      (9)    This finding is to be made only if the project area is not
predominantly residential in character and is not to be redeveloped for
predominantly residential use: That the redevelopment of the project area for
predominantly nonresidential uses is necessary for the proper development of
the community;
      (10)    This finding is to be made only where an open space land program
is involved:
That the land and the interests in land to be acquired are for the purpose of
preserving the area as open space land and are necessary for orderly long range
development, to curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban blight and
deterioration, to encourage more economical and desirable urban development and
to provide areas for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation areas,
watersheds and to preserve natural resources, and that the area so to be
acquired is of a size and character appropriate for these purposes;
       (11)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
clearing is the sole treatment proposed: That the objectives of the urban
renewal plan cannot be achieved through rehabilitation of the urban renewal
area;
      (12)    This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
both clearance and rehabilitation treatment are proposed: That the objectives
of the urban renewal plan cannot be achieved through more extensive
rehabilitation of the urban renewal area;
       (13)    This finding is to be made only where an educational institution
or a hospital is located in or near the project area and it is desired to
utilize Section 112 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended: That, in addition
to the elimination of slums and blight from the area, the undertaking of an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment project in the area will further promote
the public welfare and the proper development of the community by making land
in the area available for disposition, for uses in accordance with the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan, to an educational institution or hospital
for redevelopment in accordance with the uses specified in the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan and by providing, through the redevelopment of the
area in accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, a
cohesive neighborhood environment compatible with the functions and needs of
the educational institution or hospital, or by any combination of the
foregoing.
   (f)    The Clerk of Council shall certify as true and correct and deliver to
the Mayor a copy of the ordinance approving the plan for the Mayor's approval
or veto and appropriate further action, and any documents which were submitted
to Council to support findings made in the ordinance should be filed with a
copy of the ordinance.
 
   (g)    The taking effect of the ordinance approving an urban renewal or
redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the City
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
Federal Government, the State, any entity, instrumentality or subdivision of
either, or from any other entity or person for such purpose.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.09 FEDERAL AID CONTRACTS.
   Any contract with a Federal agency for loans, advances, grants or other
Federal aid to the City shall be approved by the Solicitor as to form and
legality and after approval and authorization by ordinance of Council, passed
in accordance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 731.17, shall be executed by
the Board of Control.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.10 MODIFICATION OF PLAN.
   An approved urban renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time; however, if the boundaries of the
project area are extended to include any land (except land contained within the
right-of-way lines of a dedicated street or alley) not previously included
therein or if there is added a new type of urban renewal activity which
requires the acquisition of property or if there is any change in the land use
or redevelopment restrictions or if there is a change in the proposed location,
extent or character of a public improvement or utility within the project area
or in any other matter directly within the jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission to approve or disapprove under Ohio R.C. 713.02, or if the
amendment, modification or change is deemed by Council to be a substantial
change in the urban renewal or redevelopment plan, then all of the proceedings
provided for in Sections
181.07 and
181.08 shall be carried out in connection with the amendment, modification or
change except that the findings to be made in the ordinance approving the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan shall be altered to fit the new
circumstances. The land use or redevelopment restrictions applicable to any
land previously conveyed by the City may not be amended, modified or changed
without the consent of the property owner.
   A general neighborhood renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time, provided that any such amendment,
modification or change shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its
written approval or recommendations pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.11 EXECUTION OF URBAN RENEWAL PROJECTS.
   (a)    Acquisition of Property. As authorized by Council and with the
approval of the Board of Control where appropriate under the provisions of Ohio
R.C. 733.22, the Director of Public Service with the appropriate advice and
assistance of the Solicitor, shall cause the necessary steps to be taken to
acquire the parcels of land in the project area in accordance with the urban
renewal or redevelopment plan, including but not limited to, the negotiation
for such parcels, obtaining appraisals, title examinations and reports,
executing contracts for any of such services and appropriate documents to
transfer title to the City; provided, that in the event appropriation of
property is necessary, Council shall initiate and carry out, with the
appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees, boards and
commissions of the City, the proceedings in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter
163. Acquisition may take place at any time after compliance with Sections
181.07  and
181.08 .
 
   (b)    City Activities Preparing Property for Disposition. The Director of
Public Service shall make the contracts, purchase the supplies and materials
and provide the labor, pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable
provisions, including the competitive bidding requirements, of Ohio R.C. 735.05
to 735.09, Chapter 153 and Sections 723.52 and 723.53, for such City activities
as may be necessary to carry out the urban renewal project, including but not
limited to the demolition, rehabilitation or repair of structures (whether
voluntarily by the private owners thereof or by the City for demonstration
purposes in limited numbers), the removal of pavement, sidewalks, lighting and
trees, capping, removal and relocation of City-owned utility lines, grading,
construction of site improvements and supporting facilities and the temporary
lease, rental or permission to let others use structures or parcels of land
while owned by the City, relocation activities and the enforcement of any
applicable provisions of law or conforming agreements relative to building,
zoning, platting and the repair or rehabilitation of land and structures
remaining in private ownership after:
      (1)    Any necessary appropriations of City moneys and authorization of
expenditures by ordinances of Council in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter
5705;
      (2)    Council action, where appropriate, to rezone property, vacate or
dedicate streets or other public places and to provide for the establishment
and preservation of open space areas pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapters 711, 713
and 723, and applicable City ordinances;
      (3)    Approvals and directions of the Board of Control, where
appropriate, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 733.22;
      (4)    Certification of funds by the Auditor, where appropriate, pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 5705.41; and
      (5)    Preparation of or approval of legal form of contracts by the
Solicitor.
   (c)    Disposition of Property. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 721.01, 721.03 and
721.28, after Council determines that real property is not needed for any
Municipal purpose, Council may authorize by ordinance the transfer, lease or
conveyance of any real property in accordance with and for the purposes of the
plan, subject to such lawful terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants
(including covenants running with the land) to assist in carrying out the
purposes of the plan. All dispositions of real property shall be at not less
than the fair value thereof determined by Council based upon the proposed new
uses and restrictions to be imposed thereon under the urban renewal plan by
Council through zoning ordinances, private covenant or otherwise. Such
determination shall be made only after obtaining independent appraisals of the
fair value upon the aforesaid bases, which appraisals shall not be binding upon
the City. The manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and may
be by negotiation, with or without any competitive bidding, and such
competition and award of a disposition contract may be based on factors other
than price alone. Two weeks publication of notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City shall be sufficient notice for the taking of
competitive bids or of the execution of a disposition contract without
competitive bidding. The financial and legal ability of those proposing to
acquire or lease such real property shall be considered in all dispositions.
The Director of Public Service shall execute, on behalf of the City, such
instruments as may be necessary to transfer, lease or convey such real property
in the form approved by the Solicitor and authorized by Council, which form
shall include all covenants running with the land, including any portions of
the plan incorporated by reference. The Director of Public Service shall
execute any certificates of completion of improvements or other appropriate
instruments, on behalf of the City, that may be necessary in accordance with
any covenants in such instruments of lease or conveyance.
 
   (d)    Conforming Agreements. If the owner of property in the project area
is willing to make the use of his property conform to the urban renewal or
redevelopment plan and Council finds and determines that the acquisition of
such property by the City will not be necessary if so conformed, the Mayor,
upon Council authorization, may enter into a conforming agreement upon such
terms and security as may be authorized by Council. The agreement may provide
for the acquisition of the property upon continued failure of the property
owner to keep his agreement after notice from the City specifying such failure.
 
   (e)    Employment of Community Corporations. In the execution of urban
renewal or redevelopment projects, Council may authorize, as to any appropriate
projects or parts of projects, the employment of community improvement
corporations, community redevelopment corporation and metropolitan housing
authorities, as defined by the statutes of Ohio, and when authorized by
ordinance of Council may grant leases, make conveyances and enter into
agreements with such corporations related to appropriate aspects of such
projects to the full extent of the powers possessed by such corporations.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.12 FINANCING.
   The cost of urban renewal activities may be paid in whole or in part by the
City from appropriate general or special funds or accounts established pursuant
to Ohio R.C. Chapters 135 and 5705 and the City may accept grants or gifts of
moneys or real or personal property from persons, entities, governments or
taxing authorities to be used for the planning and financing of such urban
renewal activities. Any investment of excess funds shall be carried out in
accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C. 731.56 to 731.59. All bonds or
notes payable from the general credit and taxes of the City to finance urban
renewal activities shall be issued in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 133. Accounts shall be maintained for the carrying out of
those urban renewal activities being financed by loans or advances from the
Federal Government separate from any other City accounts, including City
accounts used to carry out any activities being financed by the City and no
money or real or personal property shall in any way be pledged as security for
the repayment of any Federal loans or advances, except the separately described
portion of a project area set aside for such purpose, together with the
proceeds from the sale, lease or temporary operation thereof and Federal
capital grant moneys earned in connection therewith in order to avoid violating
statutory and constitutional debt and tax limitations.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.13 BUILDING PERMITS.
   After approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan by Council, no
building permit shall be issued for the improvement or enlargement of any
existing structure, or for the construction of a new structure, in the
clearance and redevelopment portion of the project area except that a permit
may be issued for the repair of an existing structure when such repair is
deemed necessary by the Department of Public Service for the immediate
preservation of the public health and safety or is required by the redeveloper
in accordance with the redevelopment plan.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.14 TAX EXEMPTION.
   (a)    All property of the City, including funds, owned or held by it for
the purposes of this chapter shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an
execution, and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the
same nor shall judgment against the City be a charge or lien upon such
property. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to or limit
the right of obligees to pursue any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge
or lien given pursuant to this chapter by the City on its rents, fees, grants
or revenues from urban renewal or redevelopment projects.
 
   (b)    The property of the City, acquired or held for the purposes of this
chapter on January 1 of any year, is declared to be public property used
exclusively for essential public and governmental purposes and such property
shall be exempt from all taxes of the City, County, State or any taxing
authority thereof; however, such tax exemption shall terminate when the City
sells, leases or otherwise disposes of such property in a project area to a
purchaser or lessee which is not a person, corporation, partnership or other
association entitled to tax exemption with respect to such property.
(Ord. 5379. Passed 10-22-64.)
181.15 SEPARABILITY; CHAPTER CONTROLLING.
   Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby
declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this
chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held
invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision to
persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall
not be affected thereby.
   Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall
be controlling. The powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and
supplemental to the powers conferred
by other law.

185.01 PROCEDURE ADOPTED.
   The City hereby elects to adopt and implement the procedure set forth in
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5722 relative to the effective utilization of nonproductive
land situated within the Municipal corporation. The existence of such
nonproductive land within the boundaries of the City is such as to necessitate
the implementation of the land reutilization program to foster either the
return of such nonproductive land to tax revenue generating status or the
devotion thereof to public use. The implementation of such a program
constitutes a public purpose and the use of such land required pursuant to such
program constitutes a public use of such land.

193 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The
tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code Section 718.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)    Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
Ohio Revised Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term
used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of
the Ohio Revised Code.
 
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
 
   (C)    As used in this chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;

extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;

operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt
income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with
any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not
more than five consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which
the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the
deduction to be fully utilized.

is available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant
to (C)(1)(h) of this section.
            (v)    Nothing in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this section
precludes a person from carrying forward, use with respect to any return filed

utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation
described in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the
amount carried forward.

the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (V)(3)(b) of

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as
payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United
States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-
employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Municipality income
tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax to
other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
          (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled
in the Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year
or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is
domiciled in the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
                (b)    The location at which the individual is registered to
vote;
                (c)    The address on the individual's driver's license;
                (d)    The location of real estate for which the individual
claimed a property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the
individual's residence or domicile;
                (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
                (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
                  (g)    The primary location at which the individual is
employed;
         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located; and
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Chapter 5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
193.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
193.12 (A).
                 (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
193.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Municipality. The individual may claim a
credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Municipality. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
193.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
193.03 of this Chapter, of 1.0%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)    (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Municipality
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business,

controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location to which the employee is required to report for
employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location at which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a calendar
year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

      (2)    (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Municipality income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Municipality if the employee performed such services in the Municipality
on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
193.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)    (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Municipality under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
      (5)    If an employer’s fixed location is the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
193.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
193.04.
         (Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)

   (A)    An annual Municipality income tax return shall be completed and filed

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
193.05 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the

other payer, and no additional tax is due the Municipality.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Municipality
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from

municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to

to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality. No remittance
is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
       (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of the Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the
Municipality's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
193.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
193.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of the Municipality's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Municipality's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
193.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
193.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Municipality;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Municipality
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
193.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. (Ord. 15-
2018. Passed 9-5-18.)
193.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject
to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed 100% of the amount
obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits
or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the lower of
the tax rate in such other municipality or the tax rate imposed under this
Chapter.
   (B)    The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Municipality’s income tax
for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Municipality for
the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled,
and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit
from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality from qualifying wages shall
be considered as paid to the Municipality in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
193.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
193.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Municipality under Section
193.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled here on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

193.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is

      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate

(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
193.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
193.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by the
Municipality. If the Municipality’s tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Municipality’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality’s tax rate. However, if the Municipality’s tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
193.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
193.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
193.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipality’s tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Municipality return showing income
subject to the Municipality income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Municipality income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
193.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
193.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
193.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
193.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio
Revised Code is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator,
except when the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to
acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. With the permission of the person affected by an
assessment, the Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)    (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. If the Tax Administrator is unable
to ascertain a new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary
mail and considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned
because of an undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within
60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the
Municipality official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipality’s income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Municipality ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)

accordance with division (A)(2) of this section.
      (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,
schedule, and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or
the Municipality by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any
other payer pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1,
2016.

   (B)   (1)    This section applies to the following:

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Municipality on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be
made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

any penalty, amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that the
Municipality has properly imposed or collected before January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-5-15.)
193.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)    (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this Chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
193.03;
      (7)    (a)    Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
193.04.
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be

presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-

the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety
test to the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).

   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Fair Housing Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state: The name and address of the
person aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint
is filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the

or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or
volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the filing
of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed necessary by
the chairman of the Board. If the secretary shall determine that there are
reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to
conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all
interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist
them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done
during such initial conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board
or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)    If the secretary of the Board determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the secretary of the Board, with respect to a matter which
involves violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the
parties have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an
informal conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines
that a complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the
Board and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine
whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve
upon the respondent a written statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of the
hearing. The respondent or his authorized counsel may file and amend such
statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in
support of its position. The hearing shall be opened to the public. The hearing
shall be held not less than fifteen calendar days nor more than thirty calendar
days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons so
issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which
record shall be made public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the secretary determines that
the person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board shall
recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought
in the name of the Board before a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

section, to grant special variances.
   (b)    Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the Safety Director. The application shall contain
information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity
for which the special variance is sought into compliance with this chapter
would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community,
or on other persons. Notice of an application for a special variance shall be
given by the Safety Director to persons who frequent the area of the sound or
activity and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any
individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special
variance may file a statement with the Safety Director containing any
information to support his claim.
   (c)    In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Safety
Director shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community and other
persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the
health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property
affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the special variance.
Applicants for special variances and persons contesting special variances may
be required to submit any information the Safety Director may reasonably
require. In granting or denying an application the Safety Director shall place
on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting
the special variance.
   (d)    Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of the
special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those
provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which
the special variance was granted.
   (e)    Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.
   (f)    The Safety Director may issue guidelines approved by resolution of
Council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special
variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a
special variance.
   (g)    The decision of the Safety Director may be appealed by the person
denied the special variance or by any person claiming to be adversely affected
by allowance of the special variance. Such appeal shall be made to the Board of
Zoning Appeals and review by the Board shall be "de novo".
(Ord. 82-80. Passed 8-15-82.)
555.12 ABATEMENT ORDERS.
   In lieu of issuing a notice of violation as provided for in Section
555.13, the Safety Director or law enforcement officer may issue an order
requiring the immediate abatement of any source of sound alleged to be in
violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 82-80. Passed 8-15-82.)
555.13 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Except where a person is acting in good faith to comply with an abatement
order issued pursuant to Section
555.12 violation of any provision of this chapter shall be cause for a notice
of violation to be issued by the Safety Director or law enforcement officer.
(Ord. 82-80. Passed 8-15-82.)
555.14 OTHER REMEDIES.
   No provision of this chapter shall be construed to impair any common law or
statutory cause of action, or legal remedy therefrom of any person for injury
or damage arising from any violation of this chapter or from other law.
(Ord. 82-80. Passed 8-15-82.)
555.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.

applicant such additional information, sketches and data as it shall reasonably
require. It may call upon experts and specialists for testimony and option
regarding the matters under examination. It may recommend to the applicant
changes in the plans that it considers desirable and may accept a voluntary
amendment to the application to include or reflect such changes. The Board

   The specific powers and duties of the Board of Zoning Appeals, which are
described in Section
1115.05, are intended to assist in carrying out the purposes of this Zoning
Code. In exercising its authority to grant variances of this Zoning Code in
individual cases which may be subject to unusual hardship, the Board shall be
guided by the following policies:
   (a)    Every property owner shall be permitted to enjoy some reasonable use
of his land.
   (b)    The intent and purpose of this Zoning Code shall be adhered to in all
decisions on matters coming before the Board.
   (c)    Decisions of the Board may not assume legislative authority by having
the effect of changing the meaning of the text of this Zoning Code or of
changing the Zoning Map.
   (d)    A lack of opportunity to obtain a maximum profit from the sale of
property does not itself constitute grounds for relief by action of the Board.
   (e)    Personal relationships in the use and ownership of property are of
relatively brief duration and do not belong in considerations of long term
improvement of and protection to the community.
      (Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1115.05 POWERS AND DUTIES, APPEALS; VARIANCES.
   The specific duties of the Board of Zoning Appeals are as follows:
   (a)    To grant variances for certain buildings and for uses in residential
districts, following which the Director of Public Safety may issue building
permits and certificates of occupancy;
   (b)    To grant variances in certain cases for those uses permitted in an I-
2 District. This action may be taken when there are specific safeguards to
protect surrounding properties from the nuisance factors of explosion and fire
hazard, noise, smell, dust, smoke, vibration and unsightliness, and when there
is assurance that these protective measures will be continued and maintained
through succeeding years and ownerships, following which the Director of Public
Safety may issue a building permit or certificate of occupancy;
   (c)    To grant variances for side, front or rear yards whenever the
provisions of this Zoning Code in respect to these requirements shall affect
construction on any lot which is nonconforming as to size or area as a result
of the adoption of this Zoning Code. Owners of such property must show that the
normal application of the standards for the zoning district in which the lot is
located would deprive the owner of practicable use of the lot or would be
contrary to established front, side or rear yard setbacks by a majority of the
structures within the same block in which the lot is located. The variance
shall be to the minimum degree necessary to permit reasonable use of the lot.
The variance shall not be granted if a majority of the buildings on lots within
the block, in which the lot for which the variance is requested is found, are
not substandard in respect to the variances being requested;
   (d)    To decide, in case of question, the exact location of a zone district
boundary line on the Zoning Map or to interpret any of the provisions of this
Zoning Code;
   (e)    To hear any appeal taken by a property owner as a result of the
denial of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy by the Director of
Public Safety when the property owner holds that such a denial is unreasonable
or unjust or would require him to adhere to standards not adhered to by at
least fifty percent of the properties within the block in which the lot is
located;
   (f)    In granting any variance the Board of Zoning Appeals may designate
specific conditions for the approval of the building permit or certificate of
occupancy for which the variance is granted and such conditions shall be listed
on the permit or certificate by the Director of Public Safety. Failure to
adhere to such conditions of approval will automatically invalidate the right
of a property owner to proceed further under such permit or certificate;
   (g)    To establish a zone boundary line within fifty feet in either
direction of a zone boundary line dividing a property in one ownership.

direct conduit for contamination of groundwater by surface water, all abandoned
wells should be properly plugged to local and state regulations.
               (Ord. 2024-09. Passed 7-5-24.)
1155.03 LIABILITY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to imply that the City of Martins
Ferry has accepted any of an owner/developer's liability if a permitted
facility or use contaminates groundwater in any aquifer.
(Ord. 2024-09. Passed 7-5-24.)
1155.04 AREA BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   If the location of the Source Water Protection Area boundary in relation to
a particular parcel is in doubt, resolution of boundary disputes shall be
through a Special Permit application. The burden of proof shall be upon the
owner(s) of the land to demonstrate where the boundaries of the area with
respect to their individual parcel(s) of land show should be located. If the
owner(s) request that local government agency determine more accurately the
boundaries of the area with respect to individual parcels of land, the agency
may engage a professional engineer, hydrologist, geologist, or soil scientist

1161.01 ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any use of land or building existing on the effective date of this section
(Ordinance 4702, passed August 21, 1956) may be continued even though such use
does not conform to the regulations of this Zoning Code for the district zone
in which it is located. No enlargement, alteration including the addition of
signs, expansion of a nonconforming use or reoccupancy for another type of a
nonconforming use shall be permitted except that businesses permitted in a C-
1 District when existing as nonconforming uses in any residence zone, may
expand their off-street parking facilities immediately adjacent to the lot or
lots on which the nonconforming use is in existence. Such expansion of off-
street parking facilities must be made in accordance with plans approved by the
Planning Commission and must provide for the construction of a six foot fence
or solid evergreen hedge on any and all sides adjoining dwellings or dwelling
units.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1161.02 REVERSION TO A CONFORMING USE.
   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been intentionally abandoned
or when such a use has been discontinued, any re-use of the building shall
conform to this Zoning Code. Whenever a nonconforming use of an open area or
tract has been discontinued, any re- use of the property shall conform to this
Zoning Code. However, this shall not be interpreted to interfere with temporary
seasonal nonconforming uses that have been in continual operation for a period
of two or more years prior to the effective date of this section (Ordinance
4702, passed August 21, 1956).
   Any building damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of ninety percent
or more if its assessed valuation may be rebuilt only in accordance with this
Zoning Code. If any building which has contained a nonconforming use is moved
or removed, the subsequent use of the property shall conform to this Zoning
Code.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1161.03 PERMITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED.
   The use of a nonconforming building or land area for which a permit was
issued legally prior to the adoption of this section (Ordinance 4702, passed
August 21, 1956) may proceed provided such building is completed within one
year, or such use of land established within thirty days after the effective
date of this section (Ordinance 4702, passed August 21, 1956).
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1161.04 EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ZONE DISTRICTS.
   Whenever the boundaries of a zone district are changed, any uses of land or
buildings which become nonconforming as a result of the change shall become
subject to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1161.05 VARIANCES FOR FRONT YARD SETBACK LINES IN SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)    In approving subdivisions, the Planning Commission may approve front
yard setback lines not in conformity with the required front yard setback lines
of the zone in which the subdivision is located under the following conditions:
      (1)    If the terrain is such that adherence to the required normal
setback line would make building more than normally difficult, or
      (2)    If it would make attachment to a sewer connection impossible
except by the use of booster pumps.
   (b)    The Director of Public Safety may grant variances for front yard
setbacks less than the normal front yard setback for lots in established
subdivisions under the following conditions:
      (1)    If a front yard setback line has been established within the block
in which the lot is located of less than the required front yard setback line
by more than fifty percent of the buildings within the block;
      (2)    If it would be impossible due to terrain to make a sewer
connection without the use of booster pumps; or
      (3)    If the terrain of the lot is of such a nature as to cause undue
hardship to the owner in construction of a building on the premises through
adhering to the normal front yard setback line.
   (c)    In the event that adjacent property owners protest the granting of a
building permit with variances as provided for in this section, by the Planning
Commission or Director of Public Safety the permit shall be denied. The owner
may then appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, which shall have the right to
hear evidence by the property owner requesting the variance and may grant the
variance if the Board feels the variance is justified.

1163.02 MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
   (a)   Legislative Purpose. Although medical marijuana is in some respects
legal under applicable state law, it remains illegal under federal law. The
purpose of this Section is to prohibit the use of real property in the City for
a medical marijuana-related business or home occupation. This section is
expressly adopted as an exercise of the City’s power of local self-government
and Home Rule authority pursuant to Section 3, Article XVIII of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio, and pursuant to the provisions of Ohio
Revised Code Section 3796.29.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for all purposes
under the Zoning Code:
      (1)   “Marijuana” means marihuana as defined in Ohio R.C. 3719.01.
      (2)   “Medical marijuana” means marijuana that is cultivated, processed,
dispensed, tested, possessed, or used, for a medical purpose, regardless of
whether such marijuana is, or is not, in a form or intended for incorporation
into a form permitted under Ohio R.C. 3796.06.
      (3)   “Medical marijuana-related business or home occupation” means a
business or home occupation use, involving in whole or in part, the
cultivation, processing, distribution, and/or wholesale or retail sale of
medical marijuana on the premises. This definition shall specifically include,
but is not limited to, dispensaries of medical marijuana; facilities for the
cultivation, packing, transportation, processing, storage, and/or sale of
medical marijuana; and bakeries or kitchens producing edible forms of medical
marijuana or products containing the same.
   (c)   Prohibition. No medical marijuana-related business or home occupation
may be established, operated, or maintained within the City, nor shall any
provision of the Zoning Code be construed to permit the use of any property for
that purpose. This prohibition shall apply to all zoning districts within the
City.
   (d)   Severability. In the event that any portion of this section shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable for any reason by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that portion shall be considered severable and the remainder of

1165.01 DWELLINGS TO ABUT STREETS; GARAGE APARTMENTS EXCEPTED.
   Every dwelling hereafter erected, moved or remodeled into a greater number
of dwelling units shall be on a lot which abuts onto a public street or way,
except garage apartments, if they fulfill all other requirements for garage
apartments.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.02 DWELLING GROUP STANDARDS.
   When several dwellings are to be erected under one ownership on a tract
containing one acre or more, there shall be similar provision for adequate
light, air and circulation between all dwellings. Plans for such development
must be approved by the Planning Commission and no reduction of open spaces on
an approved plan for a group of dwellings may be made without similar approval
of a revised plan.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.03 MULTIPLE USES ON ONE PROPERTY.
   Certain manufacturing establishments may come under the category of several
use districts as set up in this Zoning Code because of the fact that different
types of activities are carried on in different buildings or areas. In such
cases, conformity with this Zoning Code shall be determined by the particular
use which takes place in any given building or area.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.04 SIGNS IN RESIDENCE DISTRICTS.
   Signs for home occupations and professional offices shall be of an area not

   There shall be no storage of building materials, furniture, household
equipment, fixtures or any other unsightly or unsanitary material in any
required front or side yard.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.07 CLASSIFICATION OF ANNEXED AREAS.
   (a)    Areas which become annexed to the City subsequent to the adoption of
this section (Ord. 4702, passed August 21, 1956) shall be classified
automatically to conform to the zoning district to which they are contiguous,
unless the Planning Commission feels that a more restrictive zone application
is in the best interests of the City; such would be the case particularly in
zoning newly annexed properties to an R-3 District which is established
primarily for application to undeveloped and annexed areas to provide more
desirable residential sites.
   (b)    If annexed areas are contiguous to more than one zone the Planning
Commission shall have the authority to classify them in accordance with the
land uses therein and appropriately to the land uses in the adjacent contiguous
zoned districts.
   (c)    Nonconforming uses in annexed areas shall be subject to the
nonconforming use provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)    Areas shown as public and semipublic uses on the Zoning Map shall
become classified automatically to conform to the zoning district to which they
are contiguous, if and when these areas are made available for private
development or use. If they are contiguous to more than one district, the
Planning Commission shall have the authority to classify them in accordance
with the land uses in the adjacent contiguous districts.
   (e)    Public rights of way which become legally closed shall become
classified automatically with the zone district of the adjoining property.
Private easements and railroad rights of way shall only be used for the
purposes for which the easements or rights of way
were established.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.08 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR MULTIPLE ZONES UNDER ONE OWNERSHIP.
   Wherever any lot, which was in separate ownership prior to the adoption of
this section (Ordinance 4702, passed August 21, 1956), is divided by a district
zone boundary, the Planning Commission may recommend to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, upon request by the owner of the lot, that up to fifty feet on either
side of the zone district boundary be rezoned to one of the zone districts into
which it is divided and the Board of Zoning Appeals may order, on the basis of
hardship, such a zoning classification to be made effective.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.09 ZONE BOUNDARY LINES .
   Insofar as is possible, when preparing zoning district boundaries, the
Planning Commission shall draw such boundaries to coincide with existing
property lines. If such zone boundary lines therefore become irregular in
shape, the Planning Commission shall add special detail inserts in larger
scale, where necessary, to the Zoning Map in order to clearly define the zoning
district boundaries.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.10 USES NOT PROVIDED FOR.
   Whenever, in any zoning district established under this Zoning Code, a use
is neither specifically permitted nor denied and an application is made by a
property owner to the Planning Commission or Director of Public Safety for such
use, the Planning Commission shall have the authority to permit or deny the
use. The use may be permitted if it tends to conform with permitted uses in the
zone. The use shall be denied if it is not in conformity with permitted uses in
the zone.
(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1165.11 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR STREET OR HIGHWAY WIDENING.
   Whenever there are plans in existence for the widening of any street or
highway within the City, the Planning Commission may require additional front
yard setbacks for any new construction or for any structures altered or
remodeled in order to preserve and protect rights of way for such proposed
street or highway widening.

(Ord. 4702. Passed 8-21-56.)
1167.05 VARIANCES IN C-1, I-1 AND I-2 DISTRICTS.
   In order that application of this chapter may not cause undue hardship in
the established, built-up downtown section of the City, the Planning Commission
may decrease, modify or waive any and all of the off-street parking regulations
in this chapter for any properties lying in C-1, I-1 and I-2 Districts. The
Planning Commission shall not so act, however, unless the property owner

1313.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore,
the Council of City of Martins Ferry, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Martins Ferry has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions,
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Martins Ferry as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Martins Ferry.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study for Belmont County, Ohio and incorporated
areas, effective date April 5, 2006. Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Belmont
County, Ohio and incorporated areas, effective date April 5, 2006.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Martins Ferry as required by Section
1313.04 (c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Development Department, City of Martins Ferry, 5th
and Walnut Streets, Martins Ferry, Ohio 43935.
   (f)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these relations may be in conflict with a
state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage, These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Martins Ferry, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood drainage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2006-03. Passed 1-25-06.)

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100 year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS)  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus zero [0] feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Martins Ferry whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis An analysis performed by
a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC) A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) A revision based on technical data showing that
a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.
A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes
that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) A revision based on technical data that, usually
due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) A formal review and comment by FEMA
as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floors' which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other
than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with
the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park, A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Martins Ferry
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 5, 1983, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2006-03. Passed 1-25-06.)

1313.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1313.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Martins Ferry, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Martins Ferry have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Martins Ferry Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Martins
Ferry, Ohio boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Martins Ferry suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Martins Ferry has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1313.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
Variance Application Fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Martins Ferry is based upon the fee schedule established and structured by the
City of Martins Ferry Code Enforcement Department.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.  
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be preferred and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Belmont County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1355.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Public nuisance” means any fence, wall, garage, shed, house,
building, structure, tree, pole, smoke stack, or any excavation, basement,
cellar, well, cistern or sidewalk subspace or part thereof which may endanger
the health, life, limb or property, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience,
discomfort, damage or injury to anyone in the City because it is:
      (1)   Detrimental to the general health of the community;
      (2)   A fire hazard;
      (3)   Unsafe for occupancy, or use on, in, upon, about or around the
premises;
      (4)   Continually vacant which results in lack of reasonable or adequate
maintenance of the structure and grounds, causing deterioration and having a
blighting influence on nearby properties, thereby depreciating the enjoyment
and use of property in the immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is
harmful to the community in which the structure is situated.
   (b)   “Owner” means the owner of record of the premises in fee or lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, assignee of the rents,
receiver, executor, administrator, trustee, lessee or other person, firm or
corporation in control of a building, or his duly authorized agent. Any such
person thus representing the owner shall be bound to comply with the provisions
of this chapter to the same extent as if he were the owner.
      (Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.02 INSPECTION OF SUSPECTED PUBLIC NUISANCE; WRITTEN REPORT AND
PHOTOGRAPHS.
   Whenever the Code Administrator suspects the existence of a public nuisance,
he shall promptly cause the premises in question to be inspected. If the Code
Administrator finds that a nuisance does exist, he shall have photographs made
of the nuisance and the photographs shall be filed in his office along with a
written report of the inspection of the premises, the date that the photographs
were taken and the date of the inspection.
(Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.03 NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCE.
   The Code Administrator shall cause a written notice to be served on the
owner of premises where a public nuisance exists, stating the findings of a
public nuisance and that unless the owner causes the abatement of the public
nuisance, by repair or removal, it shall be abated by the City at the expense
of the owner. Such abatement shall start within fifteen days after service of
the notice and shall be complete within forty-five days or such additional
time, verified in writing, as the Code Administrator may deem advisable.
(Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.04 SERVICE OF NOTICE.
   The notice to abate a public nuisance shall be served either personally or
by mailing a copy to the owner at his usual place of residence by certified
mail with return receipt requested. If service of the written notice is not
perfected by either of these methods, then the Code Administrator shall cause
the notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City
once each week for two consecutive weeks and shall further cause a copy of the
notice to be left with the person if any, in possession of the premises, or if
there is no person in possession thereof, the Code Administrator shall cause a
copy of the notice to be attached to the property.
(Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.05 RIGHT AND PROCEDURE OF MAKING IMMEDIATE REPAIRS.
   Upon being served a notice to abate a public nuisance, the owner may make
immediate application in writing or in person to the Code Administrator for a
special building permit to undertake the repair or replacement of items found
to constitute a public nuisance.
   Adequate plans and specifications, covering the repairs or replacement shall
be furnished by the owner if required by the Code Administrator within fifteen
days.
   The Code Administrator shall, upon approval of the plans and specifications,
cause a special building permit to be issued to the owner. The special building
permit shall be for a period of thirty days and within the thirty days, the
owner shall effect and complete the repairs and/or replacements. The Code
Administrator may grant an extension to the special building permit if the
owner shows cause for the requested extension.
(Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.06 APPEAL; HEARING BOARD.
   The owner of premises where a public nuisance is deemed to exist may, within
ten days after completion of service of the notice to abate the public
nuisance, make a demand in writing to the Code Administrator for a hearing on
the question of whether in fact a public nuisance, as defined in Section
1355.01 exists. The hearing shall be held within ten days following receipt of
the written demand and at least two days notice in writing of the hearing shall
be given to the owner.
   The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Board composed of the Director
of Public Service, the Director of Public Safety and the Health Commissioner
or, in the event any such officer is unable to attend, by someone from his
department delegated by him to act in his behalf. All members of the Hearing
Board must concur that a public nuisance, as defined in Section
1355.01, exists before enforcement of the abatement is carried out. A copy of
the decision of the Hearing Board shall be promptly served upon the owner in
the manner provided for in Section
1355.04.
(Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.07 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY CITY.
   Should a public nuisance not be abated by the expiration date stated in the
notice to abate or in the special building permit issued to abate the nuisance,
or in such additional time as the Hearing Board may grant, the Code
Administrator is authorized, at any time thereafter, to enter upon the premises
and the owner shall permit him entry to abate the nuisance by demolition and
removal of the structure or by taking any other action as may be required
provided the requirements of Ohio R.C. 715.26(B) have been complied with.
   In abating the nuisance the Code Administrator may call upon any department,
division or bureau of the City for whatever assistance may be necessary; or the
Code Administrator may, by private contract, obtain the abatement, and the cost
of such private contract shall be paid for from City funds specifically
authorized by Council to abate the nuisance.
   In abating the nuisance, the Code Administrator may go to whatever extent
necessary to complete the abatement and the cost of the abatement action shall
be recovered from the owner in the following procedure:
   (a)    The owner shall be billed directly by certified mail for the cost of
the abatement. The bill for the cost of the abatement shall be paid within
sixty days after receipt of the bill.
   (b)    If costs are not so recovered then the City shall cause the cost of
the abatement to be levied as an assessment and recovered in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.261. (Ord. 5760. Passed 12-5-68.)
1355.08 PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to be a limitation or
restriction on the authority of any department, division, official or employee
of the City, but shall be deemed as an enlargement of any authority existing by
virtue of the Constitution or statutes of the State, or any ordinance enacted
by Council prior to December 12, 1968.

1370.01 ADOPTION; PURPOSE.
   (a)    The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a vacant property
registration program and to further regulate the maintenance of properties
which are in the foreclosure process, abandoned or vacant. This Chapter is
intended to reduce and prevent neighborhood blight, to avoid the creation and
continuance of public nuisances, to ameliorate conditions that threaten the
public health, safety and welfare, to promote neighborhood stability and
occupancy by preserving the condition and appearance of residential properties
and the worth and activity of commercial and industrial properties, and to
maintain property values and assessments.
   (b)    There is hereby adopted, then, for the aforementioned purposes and
for the purpose of providing a means of identifying the owner and/or
responsible entities of vacant and/or abandoned properties within the corporate
limits of the City of Martins Ferry having complete contact information on
record for these properties and responsible parties, a registration and
maintenance requirement for vacant and/or abandoned properties.
   (c)    Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to waive, relieve or
otherwise excuse an owner of property from compliance with all applicable
codes, ordinances, statutes or laws and the owner shall at all times remain
responsible and liable therefore. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prevent the enforcement of other provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Martins Ferry or the Ohio Revised Code; and nothing in this Chapter
shall be construed to relieve an owner or interested party from duties imposed
pursuant to any regulatory code, ordinance, statute, or law of the City of
Martins Ferry or the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 11-5-15.)
1370.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This Chapter shall be applicable to all residential, commercial, and
industrial structures located within the corporate limits of the City of
Martins Ferry.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 11-5-15.)
1370.03 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this section:
   (a)    "Abandoned" means a structure that is unoccupied as the result of the
relinquishment of possession or control by an owner or other person with the
right of possession or control of the structure, a mortgagor or the mortgagor's
assigns whether or not the mortgagor or mortgagor's assigns have relinquished
equity and title. A structure may be deemed abandoned when there is evidence of
conditions, taken separately or as a whole, that would lead a reasonable person
to conclude that the property was abandoned, including, but not limited to,
evidence of overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of newspapers,
circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means of notice by
publication, the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris, absence of
windows or window treatments, absence of furnishings and personal items,
statements of neighbors, delivery agents or similarly situated persons that the
property is abandoned.
   (b)    "Code Administrator" means the Code Administrator of the City of
Martins Ferry or his or her designee. If there is no currently serving Code
Administrator, the term will refer to the Safety Director of the City of
Martins Ferry or his or her designee.
   (c)    "Codes" means the Codified Ordinances of the City of Martins Ferry or
those adopted by said Codified Ordinances.
   (d)    "Inspector" means a person employed by or under contract to the City
of Martins Ferry to perform inspections to determine compliance with Codes and
to order corrective measures and/or initiate administrative, civil, or criminal
proceedings.
   (e)    "Vacant" means a structure that is not lawfully occupied or that
otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-family residential
structures shall be considered vacant when substantially all of the dwelling
units are not lawfully occupied or that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned"
under this Section. Commercial structures shall be considered vacant when all
commercial activity has ceased at the site or that otherwise qualifies as
"Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-tenant commercial structures shall be
considered vacant when substantially all of the units are not lawfully occupied
or engaging in commercial activity, or that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned"
under this Section. Industrial structures shall be considered abandoned when
all industrial or manufacturing activity has ceased at the site or that
otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. Multi-tenant industrial
structures shall be considered vacant when substantially all of the units are
not lawfully occupied or engaging in industrial or manufacturing activity, or
that otherwise qualifies as "Abandoned" under this Section. In determining
whether a structure is vacant, it is also relevant to consider, among other
factors, the percentage of the overall square footage of the building or floor
not in use to the occupied space; the condition and value of any items in the
structure and the presence of rental or for sale signs on the property.
A property that is temporarily unoccupied and is in the process of being
lawfully renovated under proper and unexpired permits shall not be considered
vacant.
A property that is listed for sale with a licensed realtor under a fully
executed listing agreement shall not be considered vacant for the first six
months of the listing agreement under which the property was first listed for
sale. Such property shall be considered vacant for purposes of this Section
upon the expiration of the first six month period for which it is first listed
for sale or upon a subsequent re-listing with the same or a different licensed
realtor. Unoccupied property listed as "For Sale by Owner" shall be considered
vacant for purposes of this Section.
   (f)    "Owner" means the person, persons, or entity holding title to the
freehold estate, a mortgagee or vendee in possession, a receiver, an executor,
a trustee and any other person, public or private entity, lessee or holder of a
lesser estate in the premises or its duly authorized agents with the authority
to bring the property into compliance with the provisions of this code,
including, but not limited to any mortgagee that has filed an action in
foreclosure on the property at issue.
A mortgagee who has filed a foreclosure action pursuant to a mortgage agreement
secured by a lien on the property shall be considered an Owner until (1) the
mortgagee releases all liens encumbering the property; (2) a Court issues a
final Confirmation of Sale of the property to a person other than the
mortgagee; or (3) the property is no longer vacant. The mere dismissal of a
foreclosure action shall not be construed to terminate the mortgagee's status
as an Owner. Under this definition, there may be more than one "Owner" of a
property for purposes of this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2015-17. Passed 11-5-15.)
1370.04 OWNER REQUIRED TO ACT; ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.

agent under the provisions of this subsection shall be deemed to consent to the

until the owner notifies the Code Administrator or his or her designee in
writing of a change of authorized agent or until the owner files a new annual
registration statement. An owner shall be liable under this Section for failing
to register an authorized agent.
   (c)    The owner of any vacant structure shall, within fifteen (15) days of
registering a vacant structure, cause a physical inspection of the structure to
be made and secure all exterior openings to prevent intrusion by birds, vermin
and trespassers, and shall cause photographs to be taken of the property that

owner or agent, is required to take action, through its own efforts or via a
contract for such services, to abate a nuisance at a vacant property the owner
will be billed for the cost of the abatement to include all labor and materials
needed to correct the violation. Nuisance abatements shall include, but are not

openings that are not closed or sealed against the entrance of rats.
(Ord. 6298. Passed 3-16-73.)
1379.06 STRUCTURAL CHANGES.
