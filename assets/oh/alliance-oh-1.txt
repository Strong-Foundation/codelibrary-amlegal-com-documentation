not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Alliance was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Alliance Codified Ordinances is indicated.

         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

133.01  CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose and Acknowledgment.
      (1)   The purpose of this policy is to ensure the City of Alliance credit
card accounts are in compliance with applicable laws (Ohio Revised Code
717.31).
      (2)   All departments must acknowledge receiving the City's Card Policy
and Procedures.
   (b)   Officers or Positions Authorized to Use Card.
      (1)   The City Auditor or his designee if granted permission.
      (2)   Department Heads: or their designee.
   (c)   Purchasing Card Transactions.
      (1)   A purchase order requisition must be completed prior to
expenditures of funds as is the case with all purchases. The City Auditor can
approve a "Then and Now Certificate" for up to $3000.00 in the event of an
emergency. The Purchasing Card can only be used for authorized City related
goods and services. The same budgetary restrictions apply to these purchases;
the Purchasing Card is simply another form of payment. Receipts/invoices must
be attached with all requisitions.
      (2)   Types of permitted expenses:
         •   Meals
         •   Gas and Oil
         •   Repair and maintenance of City assets.
         •   Professional development: classes, seminars, conferences, and
lodging.
         •   Internet
         •   Telephone
         •   Software
         •   Worker's comp premium
         •   Benefits
         •   Utilities
         •   Equipment
         •   Capital   
         •   Facilitate online purchases- especially in cases that vendors only
accept credit cards.
      (3)   The Purchasing Card (Auditor) is limited by restrictions by certain
merchant categories codes to prevent misuse. The spreadsheet attached to
original Ordinance 12-19 (MCC Group Worksheet) indicates the codes that are
included/excluded.
      (4)   Examples of restricted merchant categories/items.
         •   Entertainment
         •   Cash advances
         •   All categories identified as "high risk".
         •   Receipts/Invoices must be kept in compliance with the City's
approved record retention policy.
   (d)   the Procedure for Acquisition, Use, and Management of a Credit Card
Account and Presentation Instruments Related to the Account Including Cards and
Checks.
      (1)   Department heads must notify the City Auditor and the appropriate
appointing authority of their intentions to open any new credit card accounts.
      (2)   The "City of Alliance" shall appear on each presentation instrument
related to a credit card account including cards and checks.
      (3)   The Finance Chairman of Council will serve as the compliance
officer and report to City Council quarterly (the number of credit cards issued
and active, the cards' expiration dates and the cards' credit limits, in
accordance with the requirements of HB 312).
   (e)   Reissuing/Cancelling or Reporting Lost /Stolen Cards.  In the event of
a lost or stolen card, the cardholder must notify the issuer as well as the
Auditor's office as soon as possible.
   (f)   Credit Limits.
      (1)   The Purchasing card for the Auditor's Office has a total credit
limit of $400,000, and maximum single purchase limit of $400,000. Use limited
to Auditor and unless permission granted to others.
      (2)   Other Departments:
             Alliance Fire Department: Walmart $500 credit limit. Use is
limited to Chief and Assistant Chief
             Alliance Parks Department: Staples $7,500 limit, Walmart/Sams
$15,000. Use limited to FT Staff and RCC Manager.
             Alliance Police Department: Staples $3500, Walmart $1000. Use
authorized by Chief or Chief's secretary.
             Alliance Water Treatment: Walmart $1000. Use by Superintendent
only.
   (g)   The Actions or Omissions by an Officer or Employee That Qualify as
Misuse of a Credit Card Account.
      (1)   Card holders shall sign acknowledgement of Credit Card Policy
before receiving a card.
      (2)   Cards if issued to employees must be surrendered upon their
separation of employment from the City or when requested by the appointing
authority.
      (3)   The use of a City credit card account for expenses beyond those
authorized by this policy, or any failure to comply with these Credit Card
Policies and
Procedures, constitutes misuse of a credit card account. Any employee who
knowingly misuses a credit card account is subject to discipline, which could
include demotion, termination, in addition to criminal charges. Use of any City
card for any other than those permitted in this Policy is a violation of
section 2313.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (h)   Disclosure of Awards. The City Auditor shall file an annual report
with the Council detailing all rewards received based on the use of the City
card.
(Ord. 12-19. Passed 4-15-19.)

identify itself as an equal opportunity employer;

provided herein.

educational or training programs to which the Local Public Agency gives support
or can obtain support, will be reviewed regularly to assure that minority group

   (a)    Procedure.

out its function under this chapter. The EDPSC shall recommend to Council those
loans or other economic development activities which the EDPSC has determined
should be approved for funding from the RLF. In considering loans or other
economic development activities the EDPSC shall consider each of the program
guidelines set forth herein. Notwithstanding any delegation of authority to the
EDPSC and the Program Administrator, Council retains to itself absolute and
final authority to authorize or not authorize any economic loan or development
activity, or any part thereof, that is recommended by the EDPSC or Program
Administrator, and no disbursements shall be made from the RLF without the
express approval of Council.
(Ord. 85-10-S. Passed 10-17-11.)
177.03 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   The RLF will be administered through the Stark Development Board Finance
Corporation (SDB), or such other suitable agent or agency as City Council may
from time to time designate. This agent shall be known as the Program
Administrator, and shall serve for such terms and for such compensation or fees
as the City shall determine, such compensation or fees to be paid either by the
applicant or by the City. Any fees paid by the City shall be paid from the RLF.
The Program Administrator shall:
(a)    Prepare loan applications and provide the same for distribution through
City officials, the Alliance Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Alliance
Development Corporation, Stark Development Board or other.
(b)    Accept and review RLF loan applications and assist applicants in
preparing the same.
   (c)   As soon as is practical, make a written recommendation of approval or
disapproval on each application reviewed by it to the EDPSC.
(d)    Collect an application fee from the applicant for each loan application
received by it prior to reviewing the same.
(e)    Negotiate specific terms of financing plans with applicant and, if
applicable, with other funding sources such as S.B.A., Ohio Department of
Development, S.D.B., and the like.
(f)    Assist the applicant in the preparation of adequate business plans, and
if a loan is made, provide follow up assistance and training as necessary.
(g)    Prepare, subject to the Law Director's approval, all loan documentation
such as loan agreements, notes, mortgages, security agreements, guaranties and
the like.
(h)    Receive and collect all payments made by loan recipients, and account
for the same. Monies received by the Program Administrator shall be promptly
remitted to the City RLF.
(i)    Provide, no less often than quarterly, reports of its receipts and
collections to the City.
(j)    Report in writing to Council, no less often than semi-annually,
regarding its activities, the status of the existing and outstanding loans, the
activities of loan recipients and the status of efforts aimed at achieving the
goal set forth in Section
177.04(j).
    (k)   Projects totaling fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or less which are
located in the Downtown Development District and which are secured by a first
priority mortgage, with a supporting independent appraisal, performed by a
licensed appraiser shall be submitted directly to the EDPSC for direct
recommendation to Council. (Ord. 85-10-S. Passed 10-17-11.)
177.04 PROGRAM GUIDELINES.
   In determining whether or not to recommend an application for approval, the
EDPSC shall consider the following guidelines as to each such application:
(a)    Job Creation. The number of jobs for City residents that will be created
by use of RLF funds. At least fifty-one percent (51%) of jobs created must be
for low or moderate income individuals. Job retention projects may be
considered under these same guidelines if the jobs retained can be verified as
jobs that will be (not may be or could be) lost.
   (b)    Underlying Private Financial Commitment. At least a 1:1 ratio of
private financial commitment to RLF funds is desirable. Higher ratios of
private financial commitment should receive higher competitive ratings in the
application review process. The private financial commitment shall not include
CDBG, SBA, EDA, or other public dollars that are involved in the project.
   (c)    Eligible Economic Development. The following economic development
activities, although not in order of priority, should be given priority over
other types of eligible economic development activities:
      (1)   Fixed asset capital expenditures (land, buildings, equipment or
other construction based elements); and
      (2)   Direct relocation costs and expenses incurred by companies
relocating businesses into the City of Alliance; and
      (3)   Expenses incurred in updating building codes, health codes, fire
codes and other code compliance in existing buildings located in the City of
Alliance; and
      (4)   Land acquisition, including land acquisition by the City directly,
or assistance to the loan applicant, or working in conjunction with the Greater
Alliance Development Corporation as the City’s Community Improvement
Corporation.
      (5)   Economic development activities in the area designated as the
Downtown Development District.
      No RLF loan funds shall be used to provide for inventory, refinancing or
wages.
   (d)    Equity and Collateral. All economic development projects shall
include a minimum of 10% developer equity, which shall be available and spent
before RLF loan funds may be spent. Acceptable collateral, including but not
limited to a mortgage, lien or UCC filing, should also be provided for at least
the full amount of the RLF loan funds involved in the project. Economic
development activities located in the Downtown Development District shall
provide collateral in the form of a mortgage or lien. For any loan in excess of
50% of the eligible economic development activities described in subsection (c)
hereof, the City may require that the City hold a mortgage and be in the first
position.
(e)    Firm Private Financial Commitments. All private financial commitments
must be finalized in written form. However, such commitments may be contingent
upon City approval of an RLF loan.
(f)    Documented Need. The project application must provide documentation on
the need for the RLF loan and that the request is not just a substitute for
private funds.
(g)    Location. Any projects recommended for funding must be located within
the corporate limits of the City of Alliance. Projects located outside of the
City limits may be considered. Any project funded by an RLF loan will be
required to remain in the City unless otherwise authorized by Council.
Relocation outside the City not otherwise authorized will result in
acceleration of the RLF loan balance.
   (h)    Downtown Development District. For projects located in the Downtown
Development District, loans may be made for up to 90% of the eligible economic
development activities described in subsection (c) hereof, subject to the
provisions of Section
177.06. The Downtown Development District shall include the area of the City of
Alliance with a zoning classification of B-1 and the Arch Avenue corridor with
a B-4 zoning classification.
      EDITOR’S NOTE: The Alliance Arts, Culture and Entertainment District was
also created to coincide with the boundaries of the Downtown Development
District and to be eligible for the same benefits as that district.
   (i)   City Officials and Employees Excluded. No loan, grant or other
economic development assistance shall be provided under this program to any
elected official of the City, any employee of the City or any member of the
EDPSC or to any corporation or partnership or other entity or business owned or
controlled by any of the foregoing, or to or by any member of the immediate
family of any of the foregoing. No loan, grant or other economic development
assistance shall be given to any corporation, partnership or other entity or
business in which any of the foregoing have any interest whatsoever unless
there shall be full, prior disclosure of such interest to City Council.
      (j)    In considering all loan applications and in making all
recommendations to Council, the EDPSC shall consider the City's goal that a
minimum of 10% of total loan funds per year be provided to minority applicants.
      (k)    Unless this section is waived by Council, applicants must attend
and complete a financial counseling session as directed by the Program
Administration.
      (l)    These guidelines shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Other
factors may also be considered by the EDPSC.
      (Ord. 85-10-S. Passed 10-17-11.)
177.05 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)    An application procedure will be established by the City requiring

submittals to include:
      (1)    A three-year proforma of income and expenses;

time of the filing of the application. No application will be accepted without
the application fee.
(Ord. 22-08. Passed 7-21-08.)
177.06 LOAN AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS.
   The amount, rate and terms of loans will be negotiated by the Program
Administrator for the purpose of presenting a proposal for Council's
consideration. The rate of interest on any loan will be negotiated on a basis
of blending total interest involved in the project. The term of any loan will
be based on the collateral provided for the loan and generally will be no
longer than ten to twelve years for land and building and five to seven years
for equipment liens. The amount of any loan will generally be subject to:
   (a)   A minimum loan of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) except in cases
involving a project that creates more than two jobs and needs less than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000); and
      (b)    A maximum loan as may be determined by Council based upon the
available balance in the RLF and other factors deemed relevant by Council.
      (Ord. 85-10-S. Passed 10-17-11.)

Guidelines and the financial soundness of each project as the basis for the

   (a)    The application fee shall be established as three hundred dollars
($300.00) per application. In the event that an independent appraiser is
necessary, the applicant shall also pay the cost of the independent appraisal.
Applicant shall be responsible for any closing costs charged by Stark
Development Board Loan Corporation, and any recording fees. (Ord. 22-08. Passed
7-21-08.)
   (b)    Additional administrative costs, if any, may be provided by the City
through the U.D.A.G. repayment funds annually in an amount not to exceed five
percent (5%) of the prior fiscal year's U.D.A.G. repayment receipts, from all
sources, subject to Council appropriations.
      (Ord. 10-88. Passed 2-16-88.)

effective period of the ordinance by non-residents for work done or services
performed or rendered in the City of Alliance. The tax shall not be levied upon
expenses reported on Federal Form 2106, subject to audit and approval by the
Department of Taxation.
(3)   On any programs to include, but not limited to, deferred compensation

   (b)   Determination of Income Subject to Tax. The portion of the entire net
profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the
City, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
(1)   Multiply the entire net profits by business allocation percentage to be
the average ratio of:
A.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated. As used herein, real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereupon by 8.
B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid or accrued during the taxable

C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and services
performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of the
business or profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever
made or performed. In the event the foregoing allocation formula does not

substituted so as to produce such results.
      (2)   As used in this section, “sales made in the City” means:
A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the City
regardless of where title passes if tangible personal property is shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within the City.

C.   All sales of tangible personal properly which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside the City regardless of where title passes

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,

a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City of
Alliance, constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator
shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City of Alliance. If the
Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City of
Alliance by reason of transactions with stockholders or with corporations
related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with
such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity or by some
other method, he shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce
a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City of Alliance.

percent (1.75%); and from July 1, 2007 and thereafter until repealed at the
rate of two percent (2.0%).
(Ord. 04-07. Passed 5-21-07.)
181.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Council hereby directs that each taxpayer except as herein provided,
shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a return on or before
April 15 of the year following the effective date of this chapter, and on or
before April 15 of each year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal
year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be
filed within 105 days from the end of such fiscal year or period. This method
of filing, termed "universal filing", shall be in effect until such time as
Council provides otherwise, subject to the exception set forth in subsection
(f) hereof. If directed by Council, the Tax Administrator is authorized to
provide by regulation that the return of an employer showing the amount of tax
deducted by such employer from the salaries, income, wages, commissions or
other compensation of an employee, and paid by him to the Tax Administrator,
may be accepted as the return required of any employee whose whole income,
subject to tax under this chapter is such salary, wages, commissions or other
compensation.
   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Administrator setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from the business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require.
   (b)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the federal income tax return. A tentative return,
accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due shall be filed by
the date the return is normally due. No penalty shall be assessed in those
cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as
extended, but interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum as imposed
under Section
181.10 shall be assessed on the tax due.
   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal income tax
return may request an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a federal filing extension with the Administrator. The request for
extension shall be filed not later than the last day for filing, the municipal
income tax return as prescribed in this chapter. The Municipality shall grant
such a request for extension for a period not less than the period of the
federal extension request. The Municipality may deny a taxpayer’s request for
extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file
a copy of the request for the federal extension, owes the Municipality any
delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest, assessment, or other charge for
the late payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any
required income tax return, report, or other related document for a prior tax
period. The granting of an extension for filing a municipal income tax return
does not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless the
Municipality grants an extension of that date.
   (c)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due is deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of such tax is paid by the taxpayer pursuant to
the provisions of Section
181.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Sections
181.06,
181.07 and
181.14 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing and return.
   (d)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City of
Alliance is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on he return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded, provided, however, that no additional taxes or refunds of less than
one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others doing
business who engage persons, either on a commission basis, or as independent
contractors, and are not subject to withholding shall indicate the total amount
of earnings, payment, commission and bonuses to such as are residents of the
City of Alliance, or who do business in the City of Alliance, supported by form
(s) 1099A attached, providing the same information as is required on Federal
Form 1099.
   (f)   Retirees having no taxable income for municipal income tax purposes
shall be exempt from these filing requirements and any subsequent penalties
upon the filing of a registration form with the Tax Administrator in the manner
prescribed. Such registration shall be in effect until that time in which the
retiree registrant received taxable income for municipal income tax purposes,
at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with the provisions of
this chapter, including the filing requirements.
   (g)   Amended returns:
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
181.11 and
181.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
appointment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Alliance tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Alliance return showing income
subject to the City of Alliance tax based upon such final determination of
federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   No refund shall be allowed unless a written request is presented to
the Administrator within three years of the date the taxes were due.
   (i)   When the taxpayer's tax return indicates that a refund is due and a
refund is not issued within 180 days after the Tax Administrator has received
proper verification and substantiation as to the validity of the refund claim,
interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be paid on the amount
to be refunded after the date shown validating return.
   (j)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete shall be filed within the limits set forth for the
filing of the tax returns and the failure to file such information returns,
schedules and statements shall be deemed to be a violation. However, the
taxpayer shall have ten days after notification by the Administrator to file
the items required by this section.
(Ord. 04-07. Passed 5-21-07.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within the City of Alliance or doing business within the
City of Alliance who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission
or other compensation basis (including tips and gratuities) shall deduct at the

December 31 make a return and pay to the Income Tax Administrator the amount of
taxes so deducted. However, (when required by the Tax Administrator through an
administrative ruling or adopted by the Board of Review), any employer who
deducts taxes in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more per month
shall remit to the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the
second and third months of each calendar quarter the taxes so deducted monthly,
which remittance may be based on an estimate made by the employer of the
employer's most recent payroll. Also, by January 31, each employer shall file a
withholding reconciliation prescribed by and attainable from the Administrator
attaching form(s) W-2, setting forth the names and addresses of all employee
from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year
and the amount of tax withheld from his employees and such other information as
may be required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Administrator.
   (c)   Such employers, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same until payment is made by such employer to the City of Alliance, as a
trustee for the benefit of the City of Alliance and any such tax collected by
such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the City of
Alliance, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages,
or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person's residence, even though the residence is in the City, but such
employee shall be subject to all the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Beginning January 1, 2001, the Municipality shall not require
any nonresident employer, agent of such an employer or other payer that is not
situated in the Municipality to deduct and withhold taxes from the taxable
income of an individual unless the total amount of tax required to be deducted
and withheld for the Municipality on account of all the employer’s employees or
all of the other payer’s payees exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for
the calendar year beginning on or after that date. If the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld on account of all of the nonresident
employer’s employees or all of the other payer’s payees exceeds one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) for the calendar year beginning on or after January 1,
2001, the Municipality may require the employer, agent or other payer to deduct
and withhold taxes in each ensuing year even if the amount required to be
deducted and withheld in each of those ensuing years is one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) or less, except as otherwise provided in subsection (e)(2)
hereof.
      (2)   If a nonresident employer, agent of such an employer, or other
payer that is not situated in the Municipality is required to deduct and
withhold taxes for the ensuing year under subsection (e)(1) hereof, and the
total amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld under that subsection
in each of three consecutive ensuing years is one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) or less, the Municipality shall not require the employer, agent, or
other payer to deduct and withhold taxes in any year following the last of

pay taxes due.
(Ord. 04-07. Passed 5-21-07.)
181.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every taxpayer having or anticipating any income not subject to the
provisions of Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
181.03, shall file a declaration setting forth the estimated annual income, or
the estimated profit or loss from such business activity, together with an
estimate of the amount of tax due thereon. Such declaration shall be filed
quarterly as provided in subsection (b) hereof, upon a form furnished or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator. The estimated amount of tax due annually
may be amended each quarter to reflect the tax due under this chapter.
   (b)   Such declaration of estimated annual tax to be paid to the City of
Alliance shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the
estimated annual tax for such year and shall be paid on or before April 15,
June 15, September 15 and January 15 of the succeeding year. Provided, however,
that on or before April 15 of the year succeeding that for which such
declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any tax remaining
due the City of Alliance in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) or more shall be
paid therewith. Should it then appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the
amount of the tax to which the City of Alliance would be entitled under the
provisions of this chapter, such overpayment shall be applied against any
subsequent liability hereunder, or, at the election of the taxpayer and so
indicated on the tax return, such overpayment (or portion thereof) shall be
refunded, but in no event shall overpayment of less than one dollar ($1.00) be
refunded.
   (c)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file and pay
the annual declarations of estimated tax and the annual return and tax due
thereon using the corresponding calendar quarter of the fiscal year.
   (d)   If a taxpayer's total quarterly estimate payments do not equal at
least seventy percent (70%) of the total tax liability as established on the
taxpayer's annual tax return or if the taxpayer's total quarterly estimate
payments do not equal the taxpayer's tax liability for the preceding year,
provided that such preceding year's liability was not zero, interest and
penalty shall be assessed at the following rates and in the following manner:
      (1)   The taxpayer's annual tax liability as established on the
taxpayer's annual return shall be divided by four to determine the amount of
tax which should have been paid quarterly on an estimated basis. The difference
between the amount of tax which should have been paid quarterly on an estimated
basis and the amount of tax actually paid quarterly on an estimated basis shall
be subject to a penalty of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof and
interest of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof from the due date of
each quarterly installment to the date the annual return is due or the tax paid
thereon, whichever is earlier.
      (2)   In the event the taxpayer provides satisfactory evidence to the Tax
Administrator that the taxpayer's annual income fluctuated in such a manner
that the penalty and/or interest as specified in subsection (d)(1) hereof
should not be imposed, the Administrator, as provided in Section
181.10(d), may waive any portion of such penalty and/or interest upon the
request of the taxpayer and submission of evidence of such fluctuation to the
Administrator.
      (3)   The Administrator may waive imposition of penalty and/or interest
on underpayments of estimated taxes for good cause shown under guidelines
established by the Board of Review.
         (Ord. 04-07. Passed 5-21-07.)
181.08 DUTIES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   (1)   The Administrator shall receive and collect the tax imposed by
this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers to keep an
accurate record thereof; and shall report all moneys so received to the City
Treasurer who in return shall make a written report to Council each quarter of
all moneys collected during the preceding quarter.
      (2)   The Administrator shall enforce payment of all taxes owing the City
of Alliance, shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years showing
the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make
any return, including taxes withheld, and shall show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
   (b)   The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns and
payments.
   The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes,
interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments not to exceed six
months, when the taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter. The Administrator may
also authorize an extension of time of not more than six months in addition to
the initial six months extension for the payment of such taxes due upon written
application of the taxpayer. Denial of such extension by the Tax Administrator
may be appealed to the Board of Review as set forth in Section
181.12. Any additional extensions shall only be granted by the Board of Review.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due, shall cause the total unpaid
amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the
provisions of Sections
181.11 and
181.99 shall apply.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer or employer has failed to file a return
or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City of
Alliance from the taxpayer or employer and shall send to such taxpayer a
written statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. Such assessment shall be collected in
accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth by the Administrator and
approved by the Board of Review.
   (d)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review, the Administrator shall
have the power to compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by
Section
181.10.

returns and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or
witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or
information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with any
order or subpoena of the Income Tax Administrator authorized hereby shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as a result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, and no disclosure thereof shall be made except to municipal,

competent jurisdiction, or unless disclosure is necessary to the conduct of a
hearing before the Board of Review. Any appointed employee divulging such
information in violation of this section shall be subject to dismissal. Any

the tax evaded, or not withheld, or not paid over. No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
      (2)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
      (3)    The address on the individual's driver's license;
      (4)    The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
      (5)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
      (6)   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding the
individual's residency;
      (7)   The primary location at which the individual is employed.
      (8)   The location of educational institutions attended by the

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation or state where the educational institution is located;
      (9)   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (C) All applicable factors are provided in Ohio Revised Code Section
718.012.

182.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
182.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
         (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
          (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.
         (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the receding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars. The payment under division (B)(1)(c) of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than one of the
following:
            (i)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
(Ord. 046-16. Passed. 8-15-16.)
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
182.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent
the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.

agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   “Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03(11) of this Chapter.

Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative

issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and

sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
         (Ord. 72-17. Passed 1-16-18.)
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit

division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the

five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Ohio Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)
(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.

file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 182.062 of this Chapter,
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

tax liability for the taxable year.
            (Ord. 72-17. Passed 1-16-18.)
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals

of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091 of this Chapter for that year.

was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

income tax in another municipality, he or she shall not pay a total municipal
income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the highest rate.

profits, salaries, income, wages, commissions, other personal service
compensation or a distributive share of net profits from a resident or
nonresident unincorporated business entity or association of which he is a
partner or owner, for work done or services performed or rendered outside the
City, if it is made to appear that he (or she) or such business entity has paid
a municipal income tax on or with respect to the same income taxable under this
chapter to another municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this chapter in the amount so paid by him or her, in his or her
behalf, or by such business entity, to the other municipality; provided
however, that the credit allowed hereunder shall not exceed one and three
quarters percent (1.75%) of the taxable income. In no event, however, shall any

or such business entity.
   (C)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may by regulation provide.

his final tax return or other form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, and
presents such evidence as W-2 form(s) of the payment of a similar tax to
another municipality, as the Administrator may require.
   (E)    The Administrator, or any duly authorized agent or employee, may
exchange information with the Administrator or his authorized agent or
employees of other taxing jurisdictions for the purpose of verifying any claim
for credit by the City of Alliance residents, or for the purpose of verifying
any claims for credit for taxes paid to the City of Alliance by residents of
such other taxing jurisdictions, and may enter into agreements for such
purpose.

182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a

of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net

the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 182.092 of this Chapter
prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

      (2)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this Section, "receiving that payment" refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
(Ord. 46-16. Passed. 8-15-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the

return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
182.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this

division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
 
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 64-15. Passed 12-7-15.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;

183.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   Only the designated lands within the corporate limits of the City designated
and certified by the Director of Development as the "Alliance Enterprise Zone"
shall be considered for development under the Enterprise Zone program. The
purpose of this Enterprise Zone shall be to promote additional investments
within designated time periods pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5709.61 to 5709.66 and
these guidelines. This program is designed to assist existing businesses to
modernize and expand and to encourage new businesses to locate in the City.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.02 ENTERPRISE ZONE TAX INCENTIVE NEGOTIATING BOARD.
   (a)   Composition. The Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Negotiating Board shall
be composed of the three members of the Alliance Community Development
Committee of Council.
   (b)   Duties. It shall be the responsibility of the Negotiating Board to
provide, to accept, to review and to duly process applications for tax
incentives relating to the bona fide projects within the City's Enterprise Zone
generally consistent with the guidelines established herein and approved by the
City from time to time. The Negotiating Board shall submit its recommendations
concerning the granting of tax incentives to Council and to the Board of
Education for each bona fide application it receives as promptly as possible.
These recommendations shall be in a form sufficient to be translated into an
appropriate tax incentive agreement to be prepared by the City and submitted to
Council for its approval, and the County for its approval; any deviations from
these guidelines shall be accompanied by explanations from the Negotiating
Board.
   The Board of Education shall offer a formal advisory opinion concerning the
recommendation of the Negotiating Board for the consideration of the City. Such
action by the Board of Education would occur at a date no later than that of
the Board of Education's next regularly scheduled meeting following a
recommendation of the Negotiating Board.
   The chairman shall call meetings of the Board whenever necessary, giving at
least twenty-four hours notice of each meeting. A quorum shall be constituted
by a minimum of two members of the Board, and any recommendation concerning tax
incentive to Council shall require the affirmative vote of two members of the
Board. In all other matters respecting parliamentary procedure, Roberts’ Rules
of Order shall govern. The Board is deemed to be a public body and is subject
to Ohio R.C. Section 121.22 (the "Sunshine" Law).
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.03 APPLICATIONS AND FEES.
   Applications shall be filed for tax incentives in the Enterprise Zone at the
office of the City Auditor. Effective January 1, 1991, each application shall
be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee equal to one hundred dollars
($100.00). Such application fee shall be deposited in an account of the City
set aside for economic and/or community development purposes.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.04 PROHIBITION AGAINST DUPLICATE TAX CREDIT OR INCENTIVE BENEFIT.
   No application shall be processed by the Board nor any tax incentive granted
by the City to any applicant receiving tax incentive benefits using the same
assets for any other state or federally-sponsored tax incentive/credit programs
(including but not limited to investment tax credits for historic structures)
as to the project or parcel as to which an incentive is sought. Any incentive
erroneously granted in concert with other tax credits or incentives of any kind
shall be revoked by the City in its entirety.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.05 JOB CREATION AND/OR RETENTION.
   No tax incentive shall be granted to an enterprise whose application
projects the creation of additional payroll of less than one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) annually and a minimum of five employees or the retention of
an entire existing payroll of less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). In
order for an enterprise proposing to retain jobs to qualify for incentives, its
entire existing payroll shall be retained for the period of the incentive
granted. Failure to do so shall result in the proportionate reduction and/or
the revocation of the incentive granted by the City. (Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-
90.)
183.06 MINIMUM ASSISTANCE.
   In order to minimize the loss of tax revenues, only the minimum incentive
possible to bring about the investment shall be offered. (State law permits up
to seventy-five percent (75%) incentive of real and personal property taxes for
a period up to ten years in unincorporated areas and up to one hundred percent
(100%) incentive in municipalities. The maximum allowable incentive in amount
and duration shall only be offered when absolutely necessary to bring about the
investment.)
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.07 ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS.
   All enterprises except residential, retail sales and nonprofit institutions,
except those in conjunction with a for profit enterprise, may apply for tax
incentives consistent with these guidelines in all portions of the Enterprise
Zone. All enterprises except residential may apply for tax incentives
consistent with these guidelines in the area defined by the City Zoning Code as
the Central Business District. Only individuals who are principally involved as
an owner or manager of a business applying for Enterprise Zone tax incentives
may negotiate with the Negotiating Board for such incentives. Only property
owners or their legal representatives designated in writing may negotiate for
tax incentives relating to real property improvements.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.08 TYPES OF INCENTIVES.
   Only personal tangible property taxes and locally levied real property taxes
shall be the subject of negotiations and recommendations of and by the
Negotiating Board. No taxes collected or assessed prior to the implementation
of any tax Enterprise Zone agreement entered into pursuant to the Alliance
Enterprise Zone program shall be affected in any manner whatsoever. Incentives
may be granted for these five types of eligible projects:

183.09 TERMS AND INCENTIVE.
   Although Ohio R.C. Sections 5709.62 to 5709.66 permit granting tax
incentives in municipal Enterprise Zones of up to one hundred percent (100%)
for real and personal tangible property for up to ten years, it shall be the
policy of the City and of the Negotiating Board to generally consider the
following chart of criteria when negotiating with any given applicant.
   The Negotiating Board shall prepare its recommendations for tax incentives
in a fashion generally consistent with these guidelines. In cases where the
Negotiating Board's recommendations deviate from these guidelines, a written
explanation of this deviation shall accompany the recommendation to the City.
   The City may accept, reject or amend the Board's recommendation. However, it
is the express intention in generating these guidelines to present the City's
policy towards Enterprise Zone tax incentives in a fashion which will result in
general consistency in their implementation.
   The Negotiating Board may recommend tax incentives for incremental
investments in real and personal tangible property up to one hundred percent
(100%) for a maximum of ten years by considering the following investment,
payroll and job location criteria and summing the level of incentive suggested
for each of the three criteria:
   (a)   Investment Criteria.
 
Incentive Suggested (%) Type of Project (Years) Level of Investment

30                      8                       $500,000 to $1,999,999
40                      10                      $2 - $10 million
50                      10                      Over $10 million

   The Negotiating Board may require the submission of annual financial or
other performance reports to document job, payroll and investment levels. Such
information shall be submitted to the City within thirty days of the end of the
applicant's fiscal year or at such other time deemed appropriate by the
Negotiating Board. Furthermore, the Negotiating Board may recommend varying
terms and levels of incentives up to a maximum of ten years and a percentage
incentive not to exceed the sum of the percentage suggested for each level of
investment, payroll and job creation/retention. Percentages of incentive
granted may vary on a year-by-year basis, but should generally not exceed the
maximum percentage suggested by the sum of the three criteria.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.10 SHARING.
   For enterprises located within both the City of Alliance and the Marlington
Local School District, a special consideration shall be given by the
Negotiating Board and the Tax Review Board to obtain an equitable division of
real and personal property taxes between the Alliance City School District and
the Marlington Local School District.
(Ord. 101-90. Passed 11-5-90.)
183.11 PERIODIC REVIEW OF GUIDELINES.
   The Negotiating Board shall review the adequacy and propriety of these
guidelines annually. A report indicating the Board's findings and
recommendations concerning these guidelines shall be prepared and submitted to
the City and the appropriate school board if and when its annual review reveals
desired changes hereto.

195.01  INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an excise tax of three percent (3%)
on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient occupants, as authorized and permitted by Ohio Revised Code 5739.
Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and to
be consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.02 PURPOSE.
   There shall be levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel is or is to be furnished to transient occupants of three percent (3%) of
the amount paid or to be paid by the transient occupants for the lodging for
the purpose of providing revenue with which to help meet the needs of the City.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.03  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Administrator” means the City Auditor.
   (b)   “Hotel” means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for consideration to transient occupants, in which more than one room
is used for the accommodation of transient occupants, whether the rooms are in
one or more structures.
   (c)   “Transient occupants” means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty days.
   (d)   “Vendor” means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
and who furnishes the lodging. (Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.04 APPLICATION OF TAX.
   The tax shall be known as the transient occupancy tax. It applies and is
collectable at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when
the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions. For the purpose of the proper administration
of this chapter and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all
lodging furnished by hotels in the City to transient occupants is subject to
the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.05 TAX COLLECTION; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   The transient occupancy tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by
the transient occupants to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the
transient occupants the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each
taxable lodging. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the vendor until paid to the Administrator, as
provided in Section
195.08. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that the tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
   (b)   No exemption shall be granted except on a claim therefor made at the
time the tax is collected and under penalty or perjury on a form prescribed by
the Administrator.
   (c)   Health care providers who provide hospital or nursing home rooms in
relationship to health care to a patient are exempt from the application of
this chapter. Further, entities holding federal tax exempt status remain exempt
from the application of this chapter.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.06  RECORDS.
   The transient occupancy tax shall be stated and charged separately from the
charge for the lodging and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time
when the occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and on every
evidence of occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.07 LIMITATIONS ON TAX REDUCTIONS.
   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.08  RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall, on or before twenty (20) days after the last day of
each quarter of the calendar year, make and file a return for that quarter, on
forms prescribed by the Administrator, showing the receipts from furnishing
lodging, the amount of tax due from the vendor to the City for the period
covered by the return, and any other information the Administrator deems
necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The Administrator may
extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by
delivering or mailing them to the Administrator, together with payment of the
full amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   (b)   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit quarterly returns, as determined by the Administrator on the
basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file returns as less
frequent intervals. This authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)   All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient occupants with
the vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (d)   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him except on
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County or the City, for official use only.
   (e)   The Administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the
payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to
be made for other than quarterly periods. The returns shall be signed by the
vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 127-05. Passed 12-19-05.)
195.09  REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself from the transient
occupant. A transient occupant may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the
transient occupant directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished by the
Administrator, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds on which
the claim is founded. The claim shall be filed with the Administrator within
three years of the date of payment. (Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.10  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX.
   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient guest tax or to file
a return to make a remittance of the tax or any portion thereof, as required by
this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in the manner he may deem best to
obtain information on which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the tax,
or to file a return and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof. The
Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against the vendor the tax
and penalty provided for in this chapter. The Administrator shall have the
power to issue subpoenas compelling persons to respond, provide testimony or
provide documentary evidence which the administration deems necessary for the
enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.11 HEARINGS.
   (a)   In cases where a determination as provided for in Section
195.10 is made, the Administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed
by serving it personally or by registered or certified mail. The vendor may
within ten days after the serving or mailing of the notice, make application in
writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If
application by the vendor is not made within the time prescribed, the tax and
civil penalty determined by the Administrator shall become final and conclusive
and immediately due and payable.
   (b)   If the application is made, the Administrator shall give not less than
five days written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor
to shown cause as a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for the tax and penalty. At this hearing, the
vendor may appear and offer evidence.
(Ord. 106-04. Passed 10-18-04.)
195.99 PENALTY.
   Any vendor or transient occupant who fails to comply with the requirements
of Chapter
195 as set forth herein shall be subject to a civil penalty equal to the amount
of the transient occupancy tax which was not timely remitted to the Auditor,
plus interest on all tax due at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. In
addition to the civil penalty assessed, any vendor or transient occupant who
fails to comply with the requirement of Chapter
195 as set forth herein is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

section, a violation of subsection (b) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (4)    A violation of subsection (b) of this section is a felony and

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to

In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense, if
there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of
less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in subsections (a)
(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of subsection (a)(1)J. of this section,
that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the
guilt or innocence of the defendant. This subsection does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially
equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is

consecutive days.

should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

summons for a violation of subsection (a) of this section, the officer shall do
both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does
not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
      (4)   Except as provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section, points
shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic
wireless communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:
         A.   Access the device without a warrant unless the operator
voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R. C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona-fide
commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,

removed from the property.

days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   Any junk motor vehicle parked or stored in violation of this section may be
removed to a motor vehicle pound or other place of storage by any police
officer or the Fire Prevention Officer and shall not be released except upon

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.

which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit

conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.

(Ord. 96-85. Passed 11-4-85.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
      (4)   The Alliance Municipal Court imposing sentence upon an offender who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense under state law or
municipal ordinance may order the offender to pay to the State, Municipal or
County Law Enforcement Agencies that handled the investigation and prosecution
of all the costs reasonably incurred in having tests performed on any substance
that was the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the
substance contained any amount of controlled substance provided that the
results of the tests indicate that the substance tested did contain a
controlled substance. The Court shall not order an offender to pay the costs of
tests performed on a substance if the results of the test do not indicate that
the substance tested contained any controlled substance. The Court shall hold a
hearing to determine the amount of cost to be imposed under this section which
may be part of the sentencing hearing of the offender. The Court may waive the
costs of the testing upon submission of an Affidavit of Indigency on behalf of
the Defendant.
         (Ord. 59-07. Passed 5-7-07.)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

 545.08, 
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

cable operator to scramble any regulated service tier unless it is explicitly

cable operator to scramble any regulated service tier under any of the
following circumstances:

734.02 FINDING OF NUISANCE ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that two nuisance
activities declared in Section
734.01 have occurred within any six-month period at a residential dwelling that
is leased by an owner to a tenant or tenants, shall, as a courtesy to the owner
of such property, attempt to cause a written notice of said nuisance activities
to be sent to the owner. However, failure to prove delivery of such notice
shall in no way prevent enforcement of any provision under this chapter. The
Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding that three or more nuisance
activities declared in Section
734.01 have occurred within any six-month period at a residential dwelling
unit, shall cause a written notice to be served on the owner of the property
declaring that such property is a nuisance property. The notice shall set forth
the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to respond to and abate a
similar future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being charged the
costs of response and abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance
activities as set forth in this section. The notice shall further state that if
a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in Section
734.01 occurs within six months of the date of the notice, the city may abate
the nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property. Notice shall be served on the owner personally or by
certified mail and regular mail to the person's residence, regular place of
business or last known address. If the certified or regular mail is returned
undelivered, a copy shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or on the
person's residence, regular place of business, last known address, or the
property affected.
   (b)   If within six months of the date of the notice referred to in
subsection (a) hereof, a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in
Section
734.01 occurs, the city may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities
using administrative and law enforcement action, and the costs of such
abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. The costs of such
response and abatement shall be calculated as set forth in Section
 734.03. Any further nuisance activity that occurs within six months of a
nuisance activity for which the owner has been given notice of assessment may
be charged to the owner.
(Ord. 21-15. Passed 6-25-15.)
734.03  COSTS.
   (a)   Cost of abatement shall be assessed per each nuisance in a six month
period and up to and including five nuisances by an assessment of a service fee
of $250.00 per each nuisance, by the Chief of Police or his or her designee.
Each nuisance in a six-month period in excess of five nuisances shall be
assessed a service fee of $500.00 by the Chief of Police or his or her
designee.
   (b)   The Chief of Police shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance
property of the City's intent to assess the costs of responses and abatement
against the owner's property. Such notice shall contain a description of the
nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent to assess the
property, and the cost to abate. Notice shall be served as set forth in Section
734.02.
(Ord. 21-15. Passed 6-25-15.)
734.04 APPEAL.
   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief of
Police or his designee pursuant to Section
734.03(b) may request reconsideration of such notice by submitting a written
request to the Chief of Police within 30 days of the date of the notice.
   (a)    If, after a timely request for reconsideration is submitted, the
Chief of Police finds that the facts presented do not support the assessment of
costs, the Chief shall grant the request and rescind the notice. Otherwise, the
Chief shall deny the request.
   (b)    The property owner may appeal denial of the request by submitting a
written request within 30 days to the Chief of Police for a hearing before the
Commission on Citizen Relations.
   (c)    A request for reconsideration or appeal shall not stay any actions by
the city to abate any nuisance activity.
      (Ord. 21-15. Passed 6-25-15.)
734.05 COMMISSION ON CITIZEN RELATIONS.
   The Commission on Citizen Relations will hear appeals under this Chapter.
   (a)   There is created in Section
178.01, a Commission of Citizen Relations.
   (b)   The Commission on Citizen Relations shall hear any appeals made in
accordance with Chapter
734.
   (c)   Hearing of Appeal. In any such appeal, the City must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the intent of the City to assess the property
for abatement costs is justified. The City shall not have to show that there
has been a conviction for a criminal offense to show the existence of a
nuisance. The City shall be deemed to have failed to have met this standard if
the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
      (1)   He was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance activity
that is the basis of the notice;
      (2)   He had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and
vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. §§ 5321.17(C)
and 5321.04(A)(9); or
      (3)   He had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not, with
reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and upon
receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. §§
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
   (d)   Any appeal from a decision of the Commission on Citizen Relations
shall be made pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (Ord. 21-15. Passed 6-25-15.)
734.06  OTHER REMEDIES.
    (a)   After final decisions on any requests for reconsideration or further
appeals have been issued and the costs to abate have not been paid within 30
days of the notice of such decision, the costs of abatement shall be reported
to the Safety Service Director, who shall mail a statement of the amount
thereof to the owner of the property.
      (1)    If after 30 days such amount remains unpaid, the Safety Service
Director shall certify the total amount of the expenses, the name of the owner
of the land and a sufficient description of the premises to the County Auditor,
to be entered on the tax duplicate, to be a lien on the land from the date of
entry and to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the
City pursuant to Ohio R.C. § 731.54.
   
   (b)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the city on a property, do not affect or limit
the city's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action, including nuisance abatement and assessment as provided by law. (Ord.
21-15. Passed 6-25-15.)

chapter.
   (c)    The application for the permit shall be accompanied by documentary
evidence substantiating that the equipment had been installed prior to the
effective date.
(Ord.   99-73.   Passed 9-4-73.)
735.03  AUTOMATIC DIALING DEVICES.
   (a)    No person shall use, cause to be used, or maintain for use, any
telephone device or telephone attachment that automatically selects and
produces a prerecorded message reporting an intrusion or emergency on any
telephone line allocated by the telephone company to the Police Department,
except a telephone line or lines which may be specifically designated by the
Police Chief for such purpose. Such designated telephone line or lines shall
terminate at the Police Station.
   (b)    The City may subscribe to one or more unlisted telephone lines for
the purpose of reporting burglaries and other emergencies, or other similar
purpose, and when such line is designated, as provided in subsection (a)
hereof, persons may, upon proper application and compliance with applicable
laws and provisions of this chapter be granted a permit to install and use a
device or devices which automatically select the designated telephone line for
the purpose of playing a recorded message or to otherwise report a burglary or
other emergency.
   (c)    For alarms of the type described in subsection (a) hereof, the
message shall first state, "This is a recording." The balance of the message
shall be appropriate to the purpose for which the alarm is installed, be clear,
concise and subject to approval of the Police Chief.
   (d)    For alarms of the type described in subsection (a) hereof, each such
device shall be programmed to first dial the police station, using the
designated unlisted telephone number described in subsection (b) hereof. The

the next dialing. No more than three such dialings may be programmed and no
more than one may be programmed to select the Police Department number per
reporting incident, except under unusual circumstances and then only upon
approval of the Police Chief. No enforcement agency other than the Police
Department may be selected.
   (e)    The cost of providing the service described above, including any fee

fifteen percent for administration and handling, and rounding off the next
highest dollar, except that the minimum charge shall be thirty dollars ($30.00)
per half year. All fees charged shall be on a semiannual basis in advance.

735.04 LOCAL ALARMS.
   (a)    A permit for the installation of a local alarm which, when activated,
sounds a horn, bell, buzzer, siren or other type of audible alarm, shall be
required if the sound created by the alarm is audible beyond the premises being
served. The Police Chief shall issue a permit upon due application and

provided the level of intensity of sound of the alarm is controlled so that it
does not exceed fifty-five decibels at any location outside the premises being
served.

of automatically turning off the audible signal after a period of time
designated by the Police Chief.

   Upon proper application by any persons to connect their alarm system to the
consolidated police alarm panel, the Police Chief may approve installation if a
permit has been issued for the applicant's alarm system and if permission has
been obtained from the alarm company that maintains the panel at the police
station. Permission shall not be denied provided equipment is available and
compatible and provided charges are paid. The approval of the Police Chief must
have been gained before installation will be allowed.

burglary, or other crime, or emergency or malfunction. (Ord. 99-73. Passed 9-4-
73.)
   (b)    The permit holder of an alarm system or device shall pay to the City
a charge for each and every false alarm to which the police respond each
calendar year, according to the following schedule:
 
(1) First two false alarms                No charge
(2) Third false alarm                     $50.00
(3) Fourth and fifth false alarm          $75.00

short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or vibrating of doors
or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation or other forces
unrelated to genuine alarms.
   (c)    All components comprising such a device must be maintained by the
owner or lessee in good repair to assure reliability of operation.

may require the alarm equipment supplier to have the same revised, to meet his
approval and then promptly distributed to persons for whom installations of
such devices are made.
   (f)    The Police Chief shall have the authority, at reasonable times and
upon oral notice, to enter upon any premises within the City, to inspect the
installation and operation of an automatic protection device or signaling
device, the purpose of which is to report an emergency to the police station.

permit. The Police Chief shall take whatever steps are necessary to disconnect
the alarm.
(Ord.   99-73.   Passed 9-4-73.)

743.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall commence to drill a well for oil or gas
or operate a producing well within the corporate limits of the City, except
pursuant to a permit issued by the Mayor, as hereinafter provided. Each well
shall require a separate permit.
(Ord.   77-67.   Passed 8-7-67.)
743.02 PERMIT APPLICATION REQUIRED; FEE.
   Any person, firm or corporation desiring to engage in the drilling of a well
for oil or gas, or to carry on the operation of an oil or gas well, within the
corporate limits of the City, shall make application to the Mayor upon such
forms as may be prescribed for a permit to do so. Such application shall be
accompanied by a fee of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500). There shall be filed
a separate application and fee for each well contemplated.
   No refund or any permit fee or part thereof shall be returned for a dry hole
or for failure to exercise the privilege to drill upon a site covered by such a
permit.
(Ord. 128-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
743.03 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS; MAP AND EASEMENTS.
   It shall be the duty of the applicant at the time of presenting such
application to supply and attach to the application a map showing the exact
location of the proposed well and sludge pit and the location of storage tank
batteries and access road if there is a producing well. Such map shall remain
on file with the Mayor for future reference. The map shall be drawn to scale
and show the lot lines of all properties in the area unitized for the well, the
location of buildings and structures in the unit and the names of each of the
property owners shall be shown on the map within the drilling unit.
   Each application shall have attached with it copies of any existing
easements or options for easements for pipe lines and/or storage tanks if there
is a producing well. The copy of such easement shall be accompanied by a map
showing where such easement crosses private property. (Ord. 77-67. Passed 8-7-
67.)
743.04 INVESTIGATION; COUNCIL APPROVAL OR REJECTION OF APPLICATION.
   The Mayor or his agent shall make an Investigation of the premises for which
an oil or gas well permit is sought. Included in this investigation shall be an
inspection by the Building Department and the Fire Department.

comments and recommendations made by the Building Department and Fire
Department shall be submitted to Council, which shall grant a permit or reject
the application. (Ord. 128-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
743.05 REJECTION OF PERMIT BY COUNCIL; FEE REFUND.
   Any provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, Council, in
its sole discretion, shall have the right to reject any application for a
permit where by reason of the location of the proposed well and the character
and value of the permanent improvements already erected, the use to which the
land and surroundings are adapted for civic purposes, for sanitary or health
and safety reasons, or other unspecified reasons, the drilling of an oil or gas
well would be detrimental to the City and its inhabitants. Council shall also
not be required to consider the issuance or denial of prior applications for
permits in making its decision to grant or not to grant an application for a
permit.
   When a permit is refused the fee deposited with the application shall be
returned to the applicant. (Ord. 128-92. Passed 12-21-92.)
743.06 INSURANCE; LIABILITY.
   If decided upon affirmative vote by a majority of members elected to Council

by Council only if there is submitted to the Mayor a certificate of insurance
that includes the following requirements:
   (a)    That the applicant has liability coverage for property damage and
personal injury in the amount of not less than a combined one million dollars
($1,000,000) single limit per occurrence with an annual aggregate limit of two
million dollars ($2,000,000);
   (b)    That said insurance policy shall specifically include liability
coverage for the applicant covering the drilling and operation of the well
including liability coverage for a blowout and crater in the drilling of such
well;
   (c)    That said insurance policy shall remain in effect and be maintained
by the applicant until such well is plugged and pulled;

errors and omission insurance in the amount of one million dollars
($1,000,000);
   (f)    That the insurance carrier is required to give the City of Alliance
written notice within thirty (30) days of cancellation of both the policy
covering the applicant and the errors and omission policy covering the
insurance agent.
   The permittee shall pay to the owners of any realty, crops, buildings,
improvements, goods or chattels located in the area, except persons who are
parties to the drilling unit, any extra cost of insurance on such property
imposed by reason of granting of the permit or the operations carried on
thereunder. The permittee will hold the City free and harmless from any and all
liability growing out of the granting of such permit. (Ord. 128-92. Passed 12-
21-92.)
743.07  OWNER'S PERMISSION REQUIRED.
   No permit shall be issued for the drilling of a well except upon ground
owned by the applicant or held by the applicant under an oil and gas lease or
drilling contract from the owner, giving the owner's permission to drill the
well. Nothing contained in this chapter, nor any permit issued hereunder, shall
be deemed to grant any right or license to the permittee to enter upon or
occupy in any respect in the drilling or production operations any land not
owned by him except by the written permission of the owner. (Ord. 77-67. Passed
8-7-67.)
743.08  LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.

   (e)    Not less than 150 feet from any road, highway, street or alley;
   The distance requirements in items c, d, and e may be reduced for gas and
oil wells located in Industrial Zones if, in the opinion of Council, the
distance requirements present an undue hardship to the applicant and the
reduced distances do not present an undue threat to the public health, safety
and welfare. Council shall be the sole authority permitted to grant said
exceptions.
   Proposed sites will be considered from the perspective of both existing and
future development and should not be located so as to be potentially
detrimental to the future use and development of the parcel(s) upon which the
well is to be located or any of the adjoining parcels.
   All future buildings to be constructed that are designed for human occupancy
or buildings where the public assembles or congregates shall be located at
least 250 feet from any existing well or storage tank batteries. This distance
may be reduced if, in the opinion of Council, the distance requirement presents
an undue hardship to the owner and the reduced distance does not present an
undue threat to the public health, safety and welfare. Council shall be the
sole authority permitted to grant said exception. (Ord. 128-92. Passed 12-21-
92.)

the drilling of a well has commenced, the cessation for a like period of the
drilling operations, shall operate to terminate and cancel the permit and the
well shall be deemed abandoned for all purposes of this chapter, and no person
shall thereafter drill or operate any such well without the issuance of another
permit. (Ord. 77-67. Passed 8-7-67.)
743.10 EMERGENCY INFORMATION.
   The permittee shall supply to the Police Chief and Fire Chief the name,
address and telephone number of the persons responsible for the operation and
maintenance of each well for which a permit is issued so that some responsible
person may be reached at any time in case of an emergency.

   Prior to the commencement of the drilling operation and prior to the
installation of any tanks, the permit holder shall provide access roads, to the

drilling until adequate measures are taken to reduce the decibel level equal to
or less than seventy (70) decibels at a distance of three hundred feet ( 300')
.
   Well pumps may be operated with gasoline motors, provided such motors are

771.01 TITLE.
   This regulation shall be known and may be cited as the Unit Rating and
Registration ordinance of the City of Alliance, hereinafter referred to as
“this regulation,” "this ordinance," "this chapter" or "this code."
(Ord. 015-25. Passed 4-21-25.)

   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the residents and landowners in the City of Alliance by establishing a system
of unit registration, rating and inspection as set forth herein.

   This chapter has been adopted by the Council of the City of Alliance in open
session. The Council hereby establishes and directs the Mayor to appoint
members to a five-person board hereinafter referred to as the Housing Oversight
Board. This Housing Oversight Board shall be comprised of a Council Member, a
local landlord (that is also either a qualified elector or owns rental property
within the City of Alliance), a local tenant (that is also a qualified elector
within the City), the Safety Service Director, and the Mayor. Additional plans
to carry out and enforce this chapter may be adopted by the Safety Service
Director through the Housing Oversight Board so as to enforce this chapter.
(Ord. 015-25. Passed 4-21-25.)
771.04 EXTERIOR RATING SYSTEM.
   There is hereby established in the City of Alliance an exterior condition
rating system for each premises used for residential purposes. This exterior
condition shall be evaluated and assigned and re-evaluated and re-assigned from
time to time by the City of Alliance for each residential premises. The rating
system shall be evaluated by the Housing Oversight Board and consist, at a
minimum, of the following conditions:
   Condition A. Sound.
The house, yard, walks, steps and accessory structures are well maintained and
no exterior code violations are apparent from visual inspection.
   Condition B. Minor Repair.
Minor maintenance tasks must be performed; partial painting of exterior siding,
trim, doors, gutters and/or downspouts; replacement of rusted, worn or non-
functioning sections of gutter and downspouts is also necessary. Minor repair
to steps, yard walks, driveways, fences or other accessory structures.
   Condition C. Major Repair.
More extensive repairs need to be made such as substantial or complete painting
of the house, the roofing, installation of new gutters and/or downspouts, new
porch posts/flooring or other supports, all new yard walks or steps, extensive
repairs to accessory structures.
   Condition D. Rehabilitation.
The repairs are more costly than major repair category; however, reinvestment
is still economically feasible. Replacing such items as windows, doors, roof
sheeting, porch and rebuilding of sections of the foundation, chimney, support
walls or other structural items may be necessary.
   Condition F. Dilapidated.
Rehabilitation of Condition F structures is generally more extensive due to
interior deterioration. Similar exterior repairs as those cited in Condition D.
Rehabilitation may not be economically feasible in Condition F structures.
   (Ord. 015-25. Passed 4-21-25.)
771.05 INSPECTION AND FEE.

related to actual costs, expense and time incurred by the City for such
inspection.
   (c)    In the event that an inspection occurs as the result of a complaint
generated by a citizen, and the inspector finds no violations that would

1110.01 TITLE.
   Part Eleven of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Alliance, Ohio,
comprising all of these requirements, regulations, procedures, and map, shall
be known, cited, and referred to as the City Planning and Zoning Code, which
shall be abbreviated herein as “this Ordinance.” This Ordinance shall replace,
in its entirety, Ordinance No. 13-67, As Amended (Zoning Ordinance), as well as
Ordinance No. 68-70, As Amended (Subdivision Regulations).
1110.02 PURPOSE.
   The City of Alliance is a diverse community with a mix of residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional uses. It is essential that all use
areas be given adequate protection, that residential areas may develop in an
orderly manner, and that industrial properties may expand with new developments
and compete with other similar industries in the region. It is essential that
commercial uses have an equal degree of protection to promote and preserve the
retail shopping developments and provide adequate off-street parking facilities
which will tend to keep customers coming to said shopping areas. It is also
recognized that the purpose of industry and commerce is to provide the means
for a decent and respectable life for the citizens of a community. With regard
to the interests of public health, safety, convenience, prosperity, and general
welfare, it is essential that residential areas be suitably located in
relationship to industry and commerce, and that they be protected against the
intrusions which will interfere with decent living conditions. It is essential
that all of the uses of land and buildings within the City be so related as to
provide for economy in government in such a manner that they may mutually
support each other and each derive the greatest benefit from industry,
commercial, and residential areas.
1110.03 APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered as the minimum
requirements necessary for the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare, and they shall apply uniformly to each kind or
class of building, structure or land located within the City. Whenever the
requirements of this Ordinance are at variance with a statute or lawfully
adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or covenants, the
more restrictive requirement shall govern.

   The purpose of the OS, Open Space District is to protect and preserve open
space land as a limited and valuable resource; to permit and facilitate the
reasonable use of open space land, while simultaneously preserving and
protecting the inherent characteristics of the open space to ensure the
continued availability for scenic, recreational, conservation, and educational
purposes; for the containment of urban sprawl and the structuring of urban
development; and for the retention of land in its natural or near-natural
state; and to implement the open space element of the City’s Comprehensive Land
Use Plan.
1120.12 PRD, PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY.
   The purpose of the PRD, Planned Residential Development Overlay is to permit
the use of flexible land use and design regulations that encourage innovative
site design, allow for a mixture of residential dwelling types, and encourage
the preservation of the community’s natural features and open spaces. PRDs are
subject to design standards and requirements outlined in this Ordinance.
1120.13 PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY.
   The purpose of the PUD, Planned Unit Development Overlay is to provide a
degree of flexibility in regard to the use, area, height, bulk, and placement
regulations for developments which qualify as planned developments. These may
include, but are not limited to, residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed
use developments. Certain large developments may be of such size and
configuration as to justify a controlled degree of flexibility, and to permit a
mix of land uses that may not normally be permitted in the zoning district, but
would, under specific circumstances, increase convenience, be compatible with
the overall character of the district, and not be injurious to adjoining
properties. This designation shall not be allowed where it is sought primarily
to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of the underlying zoning
classification(s) or other City requirements rather than to achieve the
purposes stated above. PUDs are subject to design standards and regulations
outlined in this Ordinance.
1120.14 PERMITTED USES AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   In all districts, no structure or land shall be used or occupied, except in
conformance with this Ordinance. Conditional uses may be permitted in
accordance with this Ordinance, subject to a public hearing and approval by the
Commission in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined in this
Ordinance.
   Where there is a pre-existing nonconforming use which has been discontinued
for a period of one year or more, and it is unreasonable to believe that the
existing structure will be used for its currently zoned purpose within a
reasonable length of time, thereby creating an extreme hardship to the property
owner, the Commission may consider the proposed use of the structure under a
conditional use application as an exception to the Land Use Tables in Section
1122.03.
(Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
1120.15 PROHIBITED USES.
   Uses that are not specifically listed as a permitted or conditional use
permitted by this Ordinance in a zoning district, or otherwise determined to be
similar to a listed and permitted use in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, shall be prohibited in the district.
1120.16 DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   All permitted and conditional uses shall comply with any applicable
requirements of this Ordinance and all other applicable City requirements. No
structure shall be erected, reconstructed, altered or enlarged, nor shall
permits or certificates of occupancy be issued, except in conformance with this
Ordinance and all other applicable City requirements.
1120.17 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of zoning districts, as shown on the map accompanying and
made a part of this Ordinance, unless otherwise shown, are lot or tract lines
or the center lines of streets, roads or alleys, or the extension thereof,
railroad right-of-way lines and the corporate limits of the City.
1120.18 STREET, ALLEY AND RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   All streets, alleys, and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise
specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property
immediately abutting upon such streets, alleys, or railroad rights-of-way.
Where the centerline of a street or alley serves as a district boundary, the
zoning of such street or alley, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall
be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such
centerline.

FOOTNOTES TO SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS
(a)   Additional building height may be permitted in all districts except R-
1 and OS with Commission approval, in accordance with the provisions outlined
in this Ordinance.
(b)   In all districts, on a corner lot, the side yard abutting the secondary
street shall be 20 feet.
(c)   In all districts, in addition to meeting minimum lot width requirements,
each lot shall also provide lot frontage, per Sec.
1130.05, conforming to the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d)   For a nonresidential use in an R-1 or R-2 District, lot minimum (area and
width) and minimum front and side yard requirements shall be determined by the
ability of a proposed use to meet all other requirements of this Ordinance.
(e)   In an R-1 or R-2 District, if residences have been constructed on more
than 50 percent of the lots along a street frontage between two successive
intersecting streets at the time this Ordinance is adopted, the average of the
distances between the front lot lines and the nearest walls of buildings on all
such lots upon which residences exist fronting on the street shall be the
minimum front yard requirement for subsequent construction. See figure below:
 
The average front yard for lots 1 and 2 equals the sum of the existing front
yards for lots a, b, c, and d divided by the number of lots; four in this case.
(f)   In a B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, I-1 or I-2 District, where a lot abuts land in
an R-1 or R-2 District, any yard abutting such land shall be increased to 20
feet.
(g)   In a B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, I-1 or I-2 District, lot minimum (area and
width) and minimum front and side yard requirements shall be determined by the
ability of a proposed use to meet all other requirements of this Ordinance
(h)   In an OS District, there shall be no setback requirements for any lot
line that abuts another lot in an OS District.
(i)   Single-family dwellings shall comply with the following minimum floor

1126.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Residential Development (PRD) District is to
encourage the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability;
conserve natural resources, natural features, and energy; encourage innovation
in land use planning; provide enhanced housing, traffic circulation, and
recreational opportunities for the people of the City; ensure compatibility of
design and use between neighboring properties; encourage development that is
consistent with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan; and promote open space
development that preserves the City’s character and encourages the preservation
of environmentally sensitive lands.
1126.02 QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   PRDs shall be considered an optional means of development, and thus shall
only be permitted when mutually agreeable to the developer, the Commission, and
the Council. PRDs shall be in compliance with the following:
   (a)   Site Conditions. The proposed PRD site shall be in compliance with the
following conditions:
      (i)   Area. The proposed development site shall be at least 10 acres in
area, except where the Council, upon recommendation from the Commission, may
permit a PRD on a smaller site that offers unique benefits for the City, or
where the site has unique characteristics that significantly impact
development, such as an unusual shape or proportion, unusual topography, or
potentially incompatible land uses on surrounding properties.
      (ii)   Ownership. The site shall be under a single ownership or control,
and able to be planned and developed as an integrated unit.
      (iii)   Location. PRD sites shall be limited to locations that have one
or more of the following characteristics:
         (1)   Sites where flexibility is necessary because of site
constraints, including but not limited to incompatible adjoining land uses,
traffic conditions that affect ease of access or irregular parcel boundaries.
         (2)   Sites where the flexibility of the PRD regulations is necessary
to achieve a reasonable and desirable transition between land uses, without
affecting the overall City land use pattern, intensity of development or
objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or any sub-area or corridor
plans.
         (3)   Sites where the large scale of a proposed development justifies
permitting certain incidental uses not normally permitted in the zoning
district.
         (4)   Sites where the public health, safety, and welfare is better
served through creation of a planned development, because of the density of
population, adequacy of schools, parks, or other public facilities, traffic
volumes, or circulation, neighborhood compatibility, adequate provision of
light or air, or accessibility for fire and police protection.
         (5)   Sites where the proposed development is compatible with the
objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or any sub-area or corridor
plans.
      (iv)   Concept. The overall design and all uses proposed in connection
with a PRD shall be consistent with and promote the intent of the PRD concept,
as well as with specific PRD design standards set forth in this Chapter. To
this end, the applicant must prepare, submit, and present a concept plan
showing the general characteristics of the proposed PRD, including overall
size, layout, number of lots and/or units, vehicular and pedestrian circulation
system, amount of open space, types of amenities, and any other unique
attributes.
   (b)   Uses. The proposed PRD may contain any one or a combination of
residential uses listed in this Ordinance, provided that all proposed uses
satisfy the following criteria:
      (i)   Compatible with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.  Proposed uses
shall be consistent or compatible with the types and intensities of uses
specified for the site in this Ordinance, the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or
any sub-area or corridor plans.
      (ii)   Harmonious Relationship. There shall be a reasonably harmonious
relationship between the location of buildings and uses on the site relative to
buildings and uses on lands in the surrounding area.
   (c)   Other Conditions. The proposed PRD shall not:
      (i)   Be used for the sole purpose of increasing the density or intensity
of development, or avoiding the requirements for dimensional variances;
      (ii)   Be used in situations where the same land use objectives can be
accomplished by the application of conventional zoning provisions or standards;
and/or
      (iii)   Materially add public service or facility loads beyond those
contemplated in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or other adopted policies or
plans, except where the applicant provides a means of securing public
improvements needed to serve the development, and demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Council that such added loads will be accommodated or
mitigated by the PRD.
1126.03 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The purpose of this Section is to address the unique characteristics and
development requirements of developments, and to ensure that planned
developments in residential zoning districts are compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and City. Wherever possible, the provisions of the
underlying zoning district(s) and the design standards of this Ordinance and
the Subdivision Regulations shall be followed in the design of planned
developments. Modifications to these standards may be approved as part of a
Preliminary PRD Plan in any residential zoning district, provided that such
modifications are determined to be consistent with the purpose of this Chapter
and the following:
   (a)   Lot Size and Block Length.  To prevent a monotonous appearance, all
residential planned developments shall include variations in lot width, lot
area and block length. Corner lots shall have a minimum lot width of 70 feet to
provide adequate area for two front yard setbacks. Street, sidewalk, and
pathway easements and parks shall be used to visually break up blocks of
dwellings in excess of 600 feet in length.
   (b)   Density. A variable residential density bonus of up to 30 percent may
be allowed in any residential planned development, subject to the following:
      (i)   Determination of Maximum Permitted Density. The maximum permitted
density shall be determined by one of the following two procedures, at the
option of the applicant:
         (1)   Calculation. The maximum number of permitted dwelling units (du)
in a residential PRD may be calculated by:
            (a)   Taking 80 percent of the buildable area of the site (in
square feet);
            (b)   Dividing the result by the minimum lot area (in square feet)
required for the underlying zoning district; and
            (c)   Multiplying the result by the maximum permitted density (130
percent of the density permitted in the underlying zoning).
 
               (buildable area X 0.8)      maximum
               --------------------------- X 1.3 =   number of du
               minimum lot area         permitted
By way of example:
A 10 acre site with 9 buildable acres located in an R-1 District and a 30 percent
density bonus would result in the following number of permitted units:
               (392,040)   
               ------------   X   0.8   X    1.3   = 48
         (2)   Parallel Plan.  The maximum permitted density of a residential
PRD may be determined through preparation of a parallel plan by the applicant
that satisfies all conventional zoning standards and subdivision regulations,
where applicable, including but not limited to minimum lot width and area,
setbacks, neighborhood open space requirements, street rights-of-way, and
stormwater detention. During review of the Preliminary PRD Plan, the Commission
shall review the parallel plan to determine if it accurately and reasonably
shows the number of dwelling units or lots that could be feasibly be
constructed under conventional zoning. This number may be increased by a
permitted density bonus of up to 30 percent.
      (ii)   Criteria for approval of a density bonus. A residential density
bonus of up to 30 percent may be permitted for any residential PRD, subject to
a determination by the Commission that two or more of the following conditions
have been satisfied:
         (1)   An integrated mixture of housing types have been included in the
PRD.
         (2)   Recreation facilities, plazas, town squares, commons, or similar
facilities have been included, above and beyond the minimum open space
requirements, within the site or at an off-site location approved by the
Council.
         (3)   Streetscape, roadway, pathway, and similar improvements have
been included along abutting thoroughfares.
         (4)   The PRD plan includes removal or renovation of blighted
buildings, or cleanup of abandoned or contaminated sites.
         (5)   Other similar elements as determined by the Council, based upon
findings of the Commission.
   (c)   Open Space.  Planned developments that include a residential component
shall provide centrally-located, usable open space that is accessible to all
residents of the PRD:
      (i)   Character and Arrangement.  The arrangement and characteristics of
such open space shall reflect good planning and design principles, and shall
take into account the following considerations:
         (1)   The types and arrangement of uses on the site.
         (2)   The proposed use of the open space and types of improvements
proposed within the open space.
         (3)   The extent to which the leisure and recreation needs of all
segments of the population residing in the development would be accommodated.
         (4)   The manner in which the open space is integrated into the
overall design of the development.
      (ii)   Amount and Quality of Open Space. Residential planned developments
shall maintain a minimum of 30 percent of the gross area as dedicated open
space, regardless of whether or not the PRD includes a request for a density
increase and/or a lot size reduction. A minimum of 50 percent of the dedicated
open space shall be upland area that is accessible to all residents of the PRD.
The active recreational area shall be well drained, graded, seeded or sodded
and barrier-free accessible Open Space. A PRD shall provide and maintain usable
open space, accessible to all residents of the PRD, subject to the following
requirements:
         (1)   Minimum Required. A minimum of 30 percent of the gross area of a
PRD shall be set aside for common open space, regardless of whether or not the
PRD includes a request for a density increase and/or a lot size reduction.
         (2)   Location. Open space in a PRD shall meet one or more of the
following objectives:
            (a)   Preservation of distinctive natural features and rural
characteristics.
            (b)   Minimization of impact from development on wetlands, rivers,
and other environmentally sensitive areas.
            (c)   Maintenance of rural open space character along major
thoroughfares.
         (3)   Limitation. Any pervious land area that is available for the
common use of all residents of a PRD may be included as part of required open
space, except as follows:
            (a)   Required open space in a PRD shall not include the area of
any public or private road, the area of any easement providing access to the
PRD, or the area of any required setbacks, except for major thoroughfare
setbacks.
            (b)   Not more than 50 percent of required open space in a PRD
shall include the area of water bodies or regulated wetlands.
            (c)   Up to 100 percent of required open space in a PRD may include
preserved natural areas provided, however, that those areas accommodate walking
or similar passive leisure pursuits.
            (d)   Not more than 50 percent of required open space in a PRD
shall be used for active recreation facilities such as swimming pools and
tennis courts, etc.
            (e)   Not more than 75 percent of required open space in a PRD
shall be used for golf courses, provided remaining open space accommodates
walking or similar passive leisure pursuits.
      (iii)   Areas Not Considered Open Space. The following land areas shall
not be included as dedicated open space as defined in this Section:
         (1)   Areas proposed as single-family residential lots or site
condominium lots, or areas proposed to be occupied by dwellings, including the
minimum required setbacks around buildings and perimeter yard setbacks.
         (2)   Any portion of the project proposed for non-residential uses,
street rights-of-way, or access drives.
         (3)   Any submerged land area of a pond, lake, river, stream, and any
area of the PRD that has restricted access or would require payment for access.
      (iv)   Protection of Open Space. Required open space in a PRD shall be
set aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance, such as deed
restrictions or covenants that run with the land or through a conservation
easement, whereby all rights to develop the land are conveyed to a land
conservation organization or other public or private body acceptable to the
City, assuring that the open space will be developed according to the plan for
the PRD. Such conveyance shall include the following:
         (1)   Indication of proposed use(s) of the required open space in a
PRD.
         (2)   Describes the permitted activities within the dedicated open
space, and assures permanent protection from all forms of development, except
as shown on an approved PRD plan.
         (3)   Provision for privately-owned open space in a PRD to be
maintained by property owners with an interest in the open space.
         (4)   Provision of maintenance standards and a maintenance schedule.
         (5)   Permits unrestricted access by the general public during
daylight (dawn until dusk) hours.
         (6)   Provision of notice of possible City assessment to property
owners in a PRD for the cost of maintenance of open space in the event that it
is inadequately maintained and/or becomes a public nuisance, or in the event
that other facilities are not maintained.
         (7)   Recording with County Recorder, to provide notice of
restrictions to all persons having interest in property contained in the PRD.

   EDITOR’S NOTE: This section is reserved for future legislation.
1126.05  COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION PLAT OR SITE CONDOMINIUM REVIEW.
   Where a PRD includes a subdivision plat, the regulations, procedures and
design standards of the Subdivision Regulations shall apply concurrently with
the review procedures of this Chapter. The Preliminary PRD Plan shall include
the Conceptual Subdivision Plan, the Final PRD Plan shall include the
Preliminary Subdivision Plan, and the Planned Development Agreement shall
include the Final Subdivision Plat. Where a PRD includes a site condominium
development, applicable City regulations shall apply concurrently with the
provisions of this Chapter.
1126.06  INFORMAL REVIEW OF CONCEPTUAL PRD PLANS.
   Applicants are encouraged to meet with the Commission for informal review of
conceptual PRD plans. The purpose of this informal review is to discuss
applicable standards and technical issues, comment on the project’s compliance
with the standards of this Ordinance, and determine the appropriate type of
review process. The applicant or Commission may also request input from the
Administrative Official, City Engineer, and other City staff or consultants.
Conceptual PRD plans should, at minimum, include the proposed use, building
footprint, existing conditions, general site layout and conceptual grading.
Conceptual review comments are non-binding, and should be considered by the
applicant to be suggestions and recommendations only. A review fee may be
required for conceptual plan review, as determined by Council resolution.
1126.07 PRELIMIMARY PRD PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   Any person or entity owning or controlling land may submit a Preliminary PRD
Plan, with supporting documentation and a request for a determination whether
the proposal qualifies for approval under the PRD regulations.
   (a)   Submittal. Submittal of a Preliminary PRD Plan for consideration shall
include the following, where appropriate:
      (i)   PRD Description. A detailed description of the proposed uses,

and shall set forth the reasons for their action. Approval of the Final PRD
Plan shall be contingent upon approval of a PRD Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (f)   Effect of Council Action on the Final PRD Plan and PRD Agreement.
Approval of the Final PRD Plan by the Council shall allow the Administrative
Official to review construction and building plans for the project. Approval of
the PRD Agreement by the Council shall allow the Administrative Official to
issue building permits for the project. All construction and building plans and
permits shall conform to the approved Final PRD Plan, and no development may
take place on the site, nor may any use thereof be made, except in accordance
with the approved Final PRD Plan.
   (g)   Expiration of the Final PRD Plan. An approved Final PRD Plan shall
expire 365 days after the date of final approval, unless building permits have
been issued or construction has commenced. If such construction has commenced,
Final PRD Plan approval shall continue for a period of 5 years from the date
thereof. If such construction lapses for more than 180 continuous days, said
approval shall immediately expire. Upon written request received by the City

1128.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to provide a
degree of flexibility in regard to the use, area, height, bulk, and placement
regulations for large-scale developments which qualify as planned unit
developments. These may include, but are not limited to residential
developments, shopping centers, industrial, office, and business park
developments, and medical or educational campuses. Certain large developments
may be of such size and configuration as to justify a controlled degree of
flexibility, and to permit a mix of land uses that may not normally be
permitted in the zoning district, but would, under specific circumstances,
increase convenience, be compatible with the overall character of the district,
and not be injurious to adjoining properties. The further purpose of this
Chapter is to:
   (a)   Provide a consistent and uniform method for review of planned
development applications that encourages thoughtful and creative planning and
design, and high quality development practices.
   (b)   Allow reasonable regulatory flexibility that result in a substantially
higher quality of development, in accordance with the principles, goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and any sub-area plans.
   (c)   Preserve natural resources and site features, and encourage economy
and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and in the
provision of public services and utilities.
   (d)   Create usable open space particularly suited to the proposed uses
within a planned development and the natural character of the land where it is
located.
   (e)   Develop sites in such a way that proposed uses, buildings and site
improvements are compatible with each other and with adjoining uses, and to
prevent adverse impacts on neighboring properties and districts.
   (f)   Re-use or re-develop existing sites where an orderly change of use is
determined to be desirable, especially where re-use of the site is restricted
because of existing nonconformities or the strict application of conventional
zoning standards.
1128.02  QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   PUDs shall be considered an optional means of development and thus shall
only be permitted when mutually agreeable to the developer, the Commission, and
the Council. PUDs shall be in compliance with the following:
   (a)   Site Conditions. The proposed PUD site shall be in compliance with the
following conditions:
      (i)   Area.  The proposed development site shall be at least 10 acres in
area, except where the Council, upon recommendation from the Commission, may
permit a PUD on a smaller site that offers unique benefits for the City, or
where the site has unique characteristics that significantly impact
development, such as an unusual shape or proportion, unusual topography, or
potentially incompatible land uses on surrounding properties.
      (ii)   Ownership. The site shall be under a single ownership or control,
and able to be planned and developed as an integrated unit.
      (iii)   Location. PUD sites shall be limited to locations that have one
or more of the following characteristics:
         (1)   Sites determined to be appropriate for redevelopment, including
sites with buildings that are functionally obsolete, and sites where achieving
economically sound development under a conventional zoning approach would be
extremely difficult.
         (2)   Sites where flexibility is necessary because of site
constraints, including but not limited to incompatible adjoining land uses,
traffic conditions that affect ease of access or irregular parcel boundaries.
         (3)   Sites where the flexibility of the PUD regulations is necessary
to achieve a reasonable and desirable transition between land uses, without
affecting the overall City land use pattern, intensity of development or
objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or any sub-area or corridor
plans.
         (4)   Sites where the large scale of a proposed development justifies
permitting certain incidental uses not normally permitted in the zoning
district.
         (5)   Sites where the public health, safety and welfare is better
served through creation of a planned development, because of the density of
population, adequacy of schools, parks, or other public facilities, traffic
volumes or circulation, neighborhood compatibility, adequate provision of light
or air, or accessibility for fire and police protection.
         (6)   Sites where the proposed development is compatible with the
objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or any sub-area or corridor
plans.
   (b)   Uses. The proposed PUD may contain any use or a combination of uses
listed in this Ordinance, provided that all proposed uses satisfy the following
criteria:
      (i)   Compatible with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Proposed uses
shall be consistent or compatible with the types and intensities of uses
specified for the site in this Ordinance, the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or
any sub-area or corridor plans.
      (ii)   Harmonious Relationship. There shall be a reasonably harmonious
relationship between the location of buildings and uses on the site relative to
buildings and uses on lands in the surrounding area.
      (iii)   Combination of Residential and Non-residential Uses. Residential
and non- residential uses may be permitted together in a PUD, provided that
such uses are carefully integrated in a manner that creates a high quality
living environment, and are consistent with good site design and sound planning
principles. Where the Comprehensive Land Use Plan designation is residential,
non-residential uses shall be primarily for the use of the residents of the
development, and shall be limited to three percent of the gross area of the
residential land and three percent of the gross floor area of any building
occupied by residential uses.
   (c)   Other Conditions. The proposed PUD shall not:
      (i)   Be used for the sole purpose of increasing the density or intensity
of development, or avoiding the requirements for dimensional variances.
      (ii)   Be used in situations where the same land use objectives can be
accomplished by the application of conventional zoning provisions or standards.
      (iii)   Materially add public service or facility loads beyond those
contemplated in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan or other adopted policies or
plans, except where the applicant provides a means of securing public
improvements needed to serve the development, and demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Council that such added loads will be accommodated or
mitigated by the PUD.
1128.03  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The purpose of this Section is to ensure that planned developments in all
zoning districts are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and City.
Wherever possible, the provisions of the underlying zoning district(s) and the
design standards of this Ordinance shall be followed in the design of planned
developments. Modifications to these standards may be approved as part of a
Preliminary PUD Plan in any zoning district, provided that such modifications
are determined to be consistent with the purpose of this Chapter and the
following:
   (a)   Setbacks. Minimum setbacks within the development shall be based on
good planning and design principles, taking into account the degree of
compatibility between adjoining uses, and streets, sensitivity to the
characteristics of the site, the need for free access for emergency vehicles,
and the need for adequate amounts of light and air between buildings. Reduced
or increased setbacks or build-to lines may be required upon review of the
Preliminary PUD Plan in the interest of establishing a consistent relationship
of buildings to the street and sidewalk, to form a visually continuous and
pedestrian-oriented street-front, or to ensure adequate buffering between the
PUD and adjacent uses or districts.
   (b)   Maximum Height. Buildings in PUDs shall not exceed 40 feet in height,
except where taller buildings proposed on the Preliminary PUD Plan comply with
the following conditions:
      (i)   Light and Shadow. Buildings or structures greater than 40 feet in
height shall be designed so as to not have an unreasonable adverse impact on
adjacent property as a result of the shadows or glare created from reflected or
artificial light.
      (ii)   Privacy.  Buildings or structures greater than 40 feet in height
shall be designed to avoid infringing on the privacy of adjacent properties,
particularly adjacent residential uses or districts.
      (iii)   Scale of Development. Buildings or structures greater than 40
feet in height shall be compatible with the scale of the neighborhood in which
they are situated in terms of relative height mass, and scale.
   (c)   Circulation System.  The vehicular and pedestrian circulation system
within each development shall accommodate, where appropriate, the movement of
vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians throughout the proposed development and to
and from surrounding areas, safely and conveniently. Sidewalks and streets
shall be connected into the overall City network, and shall be extended to
adjacent undeveloped properties to provide future connections.
   (d)   Utility Infrastructure. Utilities shall be located underground
wherever possible, and shall meet or exceed the standards otherwise applicable
in connection with each of the respective types of uses served.
   (e)   Additional Considerations. In their review of a proposed PUD, the
Commission and Council may review other considerations that are found to be
relevant to a particular project, including but not limited to road capacity,
utility systems, signage, lighting, building materials, noise reduction and
visual screening.
1128.04  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The purpose of this Section is to address the unique characteristics and
development requirements of residential planned developments, and to ensure
that planned developments in residential zoning districts are compatible with
the surrounding neighborhood and City. Wherever possible, the provisions of the
underlying zoning district(s) and the design standards of this Ordinance and
the Subdivision Regulations shall be followed in the design of planned
developments. Modifications to these standards may be approved as part of a
Preliminary PUD Plan in any residential zoning district, provided that such
modifications are determined to be consistent with the purpose of this Chapter
and the following:
   (a)   Lot Size and Block Length. To prevent a monotonous appearance, all
residential planned developments shall include variations in lot width, lot
area and block length. Corner lots shall have a minimum lot width of 70 feet to
provide adequate area for two front yard setbacks. Streets, sidewalk and
pathway easements and parks shall be used to visually break-up blocks of
dwellings in excess of 600 feet in length.
   (b)   Density. A variable residential density bonus of up to 30 percent may
be allowed in any residential planned development, subject to the following:
      (i)   Determination of Maximum Permitted Density.  The maximum permitted
density shall be determined by one of the following two procedures, at the
option of the applicant:
      (ii)   Determination of Maximum Permitted Density.  The maximum permitted
density shall be determined by one of the following two procedures, at the
option of the applicant:
         (1)   Calculation. The maximum number of permitted dwelling units (du)
in a residential PRD may be calculated by:
            (a)   Taking 80 percent of the buildable area of the site (in
square feet);
            (b)   Dividing the result by the minimum lot area (in square feet)
required for the underlying zoning district; and
            (c)   Multiplying the result by the maximum permitted density (130
percent of the density permitted in the underlying zoning).
 
               (buildable area X 0.8)      maximum
               --------------------------- X 1.3 =   number of du
               minimum lot area         permitted
   
               By way of example:
A 10 acre site with 9 buildable acres located in an R-1 District and a 30 percent
density bonus would result in the following number of permitted units:
               (392,040)   
               ------------   X   0.8   X    1.3   = 48
         (2)   Parallel Plan. The maximum permitted density of a residential
PUD may be determined through preparation of a parallel plan by the applicant
that satisfies all conventional zoning standards and subdivision regulations,
where applicable, including but not limited to minimum lot width and area,
setbacks, neighborhood open space requirements, street rights-of-way and
stormwater detention. During review of the Preliminary PUD Plan, the Commission
shall review the parallel plan to determine if it accurately and reasonably
shows the number of dwelling units or lots that could be feasibly be
constructed under conventional zoning. This number may be increased by a
permitted density bonus of up to 30 percent.
      (ii)   Criteria for Approval of a Density Bonus.  A residential density
bonus of up to 30 percent may be permitted for any residential PUD, subject to
a determination by the Commission that two or more of the following conditions
have been satisfied:
         (1)   An integrated mixture of housing types have been included in the
PUD.
         (2)   Recreation facilities, plazas, town squares, commons or similar
facilities have been included, above and beyond the minimum open space
requirements, within the site or at an off-site location approved by the
Council.
         (3)   Streetscape, roadway, pathway and similar improvements have been
included along abutting thoroughfares.
         (4)   The PUD plan includes removal or renovation of blighted
buildings, or cleanup of abandoned or contaminated sites.
         (5)   Other similar elements as determined by the Council, based upon
findings of the Commission.
   (c)   Open Space.  Planned developments that include a residential component
shall provide centrally-located, usable open space that is accessible to all
residents of the PUD:
      (i)   Character and Arrangement.  The arrangement and characteristics of
such open space shall reflect good planning and design principles, and shall
take into account the following considerations:
         (1)   The types and arrangement of uses on the site.
         (2)   The proposed uses of the open space and types of improvements
proposed within the open space.
         (3)   The extent to which the leisure and recreation needs of all
segments of the population residing in the development would be accommodated.
         (4)   The manner in which the open space is integrated into the
overall design of the development.
      (ii)   Amount and Quality of Open Space.  Residential PUDs shall maintain
a minimum of 30 percent of the gross area as dedicated open space. A minimum of
50 percent of the dedicated open space shall be upland area that is accessible
to all residents of the PUD. An active recreational area with appropriate
equipment or amenities shall be provided within the dedicated open space, equal
in size to a minimum of 1,500 square feet per dwelling in the residential
component of the PUD. The active recreational area shall be well drained,
graded, seeded or sodded and barrier-free accessible.
         (1)   Minimum Required. A minimum of 30 percent of the gross area of a
PUD shall be set aside for common open space, regardless of whether or not the
PUD includes a request for a density increase and/or a lot size reduction.
         (2)   Location. Open space in a PUD shall meet one or more of the
following objectives:
            (a)   Preservation of distinctive natural features and rural
characteristics.
            (b)   Minimization of impact from development on wetlands, rivers,
and other environmentally sensitive areas.
            (c)   Maintenance of rural open space character along major
thoroughfares.
         (3)   Limitation. Any pervious land area that is available for the
common use of all residents of a PUD may be included as part of required open
space, except as follows:
            (a)   Required open space in a PUD shall not include the area of
any public or private road, the area of any easement providing access to the
PUD, or the area of any required setbacks, except for major thoroughfare
setbacks.
            (b)   Not more than 50 percent of required open space in a PUD
shall include the area of water bodies or regulated wetlands.
            (c)   Up to 100 percent of required open space in a PUD may include
preserved natural areas provided, however, that those areas accommodate walking

not be included as dedicated open space as defined in this Section:
         (1)   Areas proposed as single-family residential lots or site
condominium lots, or areas proposed to be occupied by dwellings, including the
minimum required setbacks around buildings and perimeter yard setbacks.
         (2)   Any portion of the project proposed for non-residential uses,
street rights-of-way or access drives.
         (3)   Any submerged land area of a pond, lake, river or stream, and
any area of the PUD that has restricted access or would require payment for
access.
      (iv)   Protection of Open Space. Required open space in a PUD shall be
set aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance, such as deed
restrictions or covenants that run with the land or through a conservation
easement, whereby all rights to develop the land are conveyed to a land
conservation organization or other public or private body acceptable to the
City, assuring that the open space will be developed according to the plan for
the PUD. Such conveyance shall include the following:
         (1)   Indication of proposed use(s) of the required open space in a
PUD.
         (2)   Describes the permitted activities within the dedicated open
space, and assures permanent protection from all forms of development, except
as shown on an approved PUD plan.
         (3)   Provision for privately-owned open space in a PUD to be

that other facilities are not maintained.
         (7)   Recording with County Recorder, to provide notice of
restrictions to all persons having interest in property contained in the PUD.
1128.05 COORDINATION WITH SUBDIVISION PLAT OR SITE CONDOMINIUM REVIEW.
   Where a PUD includes a subdivision plat, the regulations, procedures and
design standards of the Subdivision Regulations shall apply concurrently with
the review procedures of this Chapter. The Preliminary PUD Plan shall include
the Conceptual Subdivision Plan, the Final PUD Plan shall include the
Preliminary Subdivision Plan, and the Planned Development Agreement shall
include the Final Subdivision Plat. Where a PUD includes a site condominium
development, applicable City regulations shall apply concurrently with the
provisions of this Chapter.
1128.06  INFORMAL REVIEW OF CONCEPTUAL PUD PLANS.
   Applicants are encouraged to meet with the Commission for informal review of
conceptual PUD plans. The purpose of this informal review is to discuss
applicable standards and technical issues, comment on the project’s compliance
with the standards of this Ordinance, and determine the appropriate type of
review process. The applicant or Commission may also request input from the
Administrative Official, City Engineer, and other City staff or consultants.
Conceptual PUD plans should, at minimum, include the proposed use, building
footprint, existing conditions, general site layout and conceptual grading.
Conceptual review comments are non-binding, and should be considered by the

have been secured under this Ordinance. Any such building or structure shall
fully conform to all the provisions of this Ordinance, in the same manner as a
new building or structure. Before a permit may be issued for moving a building
or structure, the Administrative Official shall inspect same and shall
determine if it is in a safe condition to be moved, whether it may be
reconditioned to comply with the building code and other City requirements for
the use and occupancy for which it is to be used and whether it will be of
similar character with the buildings in the area where it is to be moved.

1134.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare through the provision of standards for existing and proposed
signs of all types. More specifically, this Chapter is intended to:
   (a)   Enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community.
   (b)   Promote and maintain visually attractive residential, retail,
commercial, and mixed use districts.
   (c)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to reduce sign distraction
and confusion that may be contributing factors in traffic congestion and
accidents, and maintain safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environments.
   (d)   Provide review procedures that enable the City to evaluate the
appropriateness of a sign to the site, building and surroundings.
1134.02  SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect,
construct, or alter any sign in the City except in conformance with the
provisions of this Ordinance, subject to issuance of a permit, unless
specifically exempted below. All temporary ground signs and banner signs except
ideological signs shall be registered with the Administrative Official.
Furthermore the following signs and displays shall be specifically exempted
from and not regulated by this Ordinance:
   (a)   Official traffic signs, government, school or utility signs; or flags
of any nation, government or noncommercial organization.
   (b)   Signs not intended to be viewed from the public right-of-way or
scoreboards on athletic fields.
   (c)   Cornerstone inscriptions, commemorative plaques or other signs that
are part of masonry facades.
   (d)   Gravestones, religious symbols or monuments in cemeteries or monument
sales lots.
   (e)   Signs of less than one square foot in sign area such as street numbers
on buildings, security system signs or stickers, identification of store hours,
emblems of credit cards accepted, seals indicating membership in business or
trade associations, and the like.
   (f)   Signs accessory to juvenile activities, such as a child’s lemonade
stand or temporary play-related sidewalk markings.
   (g)   Temporary signs used for charity or nonprofit fundraising and not for
private gain, or civic or community affairs of a public or semipublic nature.
   (h)   Holiday or other temporary decorations.
   (i)   Other signs similar in nature in the judgment of the Administrative
Official to the above signs.
1134.03  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Plans, Specifications, and Permits.
      (i)   Permits.  It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, alter,
relocate, or structurally change a sign or other advertising structure, unless
specifically exempted by this Ordinance, without first obtaining a permit in
accordance with the provisions set forth herein. A permit shall require payment
of a fee, as noted on a fee schedule as may be established, adopted, and
amended from time to time by the Council.
      (ii)   Applications. Application for a sign permit shall be made upon
forms provided by the Administrative Official. The following information shall
be required:
         (1)   Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
         (2)   Location of the building, structure, or lot on which the sign is
to be attached or erected.
         (3)   Position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings,
structures, and property lines. The Administrative Official may require
information to be provided for on a certified survey or drawing sealed by a
registered engineer.
         (4)   Plans showing the dimensions, materials, method of construction,
and attachment to the building or in the ground.
         (5)   Copies of stress sheets and calculations, if deemed necessary,
showing the structure as designed for dead load and wind pressure.
         (6)   Name and address of the person, firm, or corporation owning,
erecting, and maintaining the sign.
         (7)   Information concerning required electrical connections.
         (8)   Insurance policy or bond, as required in this Ordinance.
         (9)   Written consent of the owner or lessee of the premises upon
which the sign is to be erected.
         (10)   Other information as required by the Administrative Official to
make the determination that the sign is in compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations.
      (iii)   Review of Application.
         (1)   Commission Review. Sign permit applications submitted in
conjunction with the proposed construction of a new building or addition to an
existing building shall be reviewed by the Commission as a part of the required
site plan review. Proposed sign locations and dimensions must be shown on the
site plan.
         (2)   Issuance of a Permit. Following review and approval of a sign
application by the Commission and Administrative Official, as appropriate, the
Administrative Official shall have the authority to issue a sign permit.
      (iv)   Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated except in
conformity with the provisions set forth herein for new signs, nor until a
proper permit has been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for
ordinary servicing or repainting of an existing sign, cleaning of a sign, or
changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for such changes
(such as lettering on a marquee or numbers on a gasoline price sign).
Furthermore, a permit shall not be required for ideological signs, signplates
for residential uses, temporary signs for residential uses and in residential
districts, temporary ground signs in nonresidential districts advertising the
sale or lease of the property on which they are located, and temporary window
signs, provided that all applicable regulations of this Chapter are complied
with.
   (b)   Inspection and Maintenance.
      (i)   Inspection of New Signs.   All signs for which a permit has been
issued shall be inspected by the Administrative Official when erected. Approval
shall be granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the
approved plans and applicable Zoning Ordinance and Building Code standards. In
cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or
otherwise enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the Administrative Official
when such fastenings are to be installed so that inspection may be completed
before enclosure.
      (ii)   Inspection of Existing Signs. The Administrative Official shall
have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs.
In conducting such inspections, the Administrative Official shall determine
whether the sign is adequately supported, painted to prevent corrosion, and so
secured to the building or other support to safely bear the weight of the sign
and pressure created by the wind.
      (iii)   Correction of Defects. If the Administrative Official finds that
any sign is unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed, or poorly maintained, the
sign erector, owner of the sign, or owner of the land shall make the sign safe
and secure by completing any necessary reconstruction or repairs, or entirely
remove the sign in accordance with the timetable established by the
Administrative Official. (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
   (c)   Removal of Abandoned Signs. Whenever a sign is abandoned, as defined
herein, the Administrative Official shall document the date of sign
abandonment. An abandoned sign shall be removed at such time as the
Administrative Official documents that both of the following circumstances
exist: (1) a period of greater than 365 consecutive days has elapsed since the
date of sign abandonment; and (2) no permit has been issued during such period
for the building, building unit and/or use associated with the abandoned sign.
However, where a conforming sign structure and frame are typically reused by a
current occupant in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not
be required to remove the sign structure and frame in the interim periods when
the building is not occupied, provided that the sign structure and frame are
maintained in good condition, and that abandoned sign faces are replaced with
blank sign faces in during said periods.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs. No nonconforming sign shall be altered or
reconstructed, unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with
this Ordinance, except that nonconforming signs shall comply with the following
regulations:
      (i)    Repairs and Maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted,
provided that any nonconforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an
extent greater than 50 percent of the sign’s replacement cost, exclusive of the
foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal maintenance shall include
painting of chipped or faded signs; replacement of sign face; or, repair or
replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices.
      (ii)    Nonconforming Changeable Copy Signs. The message on a
nonconforming changeable copy sign or nonconforming bulletin board sign may be
changed provided that the change does not create any greater nonconformity.
      (iii)    Substitution. No nonconforming sign shall be replaced with
another nonconforming sign.
      (iv)    Modifications to the Principal Building. Beginning on January 1,
2015, whenever the principal building on a site on which a nonconforming sign
is located is modified to the extent that site plan review and approval is
required, the nonconforming sign shall be removed. In such case, however, the
existing sign foundation and wiring may be used to the extent that they conform
to all requirements of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
   (e)   Appeal to the Board. Any party who has been refused a sign permit for
a proposed sign may file an appeal with the Board, in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance. In determining whether a variance is appropriate,
the Board shall, in addition to other review criteria specified in this
Ordinance, study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary
circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical
difficulty in complying with the sign standards. The presence of any of the
circumstances listed may be sufficient to justify granting a variance; however,
the Board may decline to grant a variance even if certain of the following
circumstances are present:
      (i)   Permitted signage could not be easily seen by passing motorists due
to the configuration of existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions.
      (ii)   Permitted signage could not be seen by passing motorists in
sufficient time to permit safe deceleration and exit. In determining whether
such circumstances exist, the Board shall consider the width of the road, the
number of moving lanes, the volume of traffic, and speed limits.
      (iii)   Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the
visibility or advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel.
      (iv)   Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe
alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as but not limited to:
removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling of wetlands, or
obstruction of a natural drainage course.
      (v)   Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of
motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passers-by.
      (vi)   Variances from certain sign regulations would be offset by
increased building setback, increased landscaping, or other such enhancements,
so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared
to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a
conforming sign.
      (vii)   A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of
this Ordinance would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or
frontage of the parcel or building.
1134.04 COMPUTATION AND MEASUREMENTS.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area and building frontage:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (i)   Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the frame and structural support unless such
structural support is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign
design.
      (ii)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign
shall be the area of one rectangular shape that encompasses the entire
background or frame.
      (iii)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements
on a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregular shaped
ground sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of one rectangular shape
that encompasses the perimeter of all the elements in the display.
         (1)   When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but
the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be the area of one
rectangular shape that comprises all the display areas, including the space
between the elements.
         (2)   One minor extension may be permitted to extend above or below
the sign area when the area of the extension is less than 25 percent of the
open space included in the sign area. For the purposes of this Chapter, only
the open space within the sign area that is located above and below the
majority of the letters shall be included in the calculation.
         (3)   For ground signs and projecting signs, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces when two identical display
faces are joined, are parallel or within 30 degrees of being parallel to each
other.
         (4)   Air under a ground sign between supporting posts, air between a
projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached, and lighting fixtures and
associated brackets shall not be included in the calculation of sign area.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from
the average grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the tallest
element of the calculated sign area or support structure. A ground sign on a
man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the
average site grade prior to the addition of the sign.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
these sign regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public
street or that contains a public entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage.
      (i)   The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (ii)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (iii)   A building shall have only one building frontage except as
otherwise set forth below.
      (iv)   A building shall have two frontages whenever the lot fronts on two
or more streets, or the building has a public entrance on a wall other than the
wall that faces the street. The property owner shall determine which wall shall
be the primary building frontage and which wall shall be the secondary building
frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary
frontage and only one additional wall considered its secondary frontage.
      (v)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
   (d)   Determining Window Area.  The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than 15 feet in height above grade.

CHAPTER 1136
Landscaping, Screening, and Planting
1136.01    Purpose.
1136.02    Performance standards.
1136.03    Scope.
1136.04    Plan submission requirements.
1136.05    Standards.

1136.11    Location of screening.
1136.12    Openings in walls, fences, and berms; construction standards for
walls.
1136.13    Bumper stops, curbing or wheel chocks in parking spaces.
1136.14    Corner clearance visibility.
1136.15    Irrigation of vegetation.
1136.16    Performance guarantee.
1136.17    Waiver of requirements.
1136.18    Scope of plant material requirements.

1136.20    Suggested plant materials.
1136.21    Plant materials not permitted.
1136.22    Installation and maintenance.
1136.01 PURPOSE.
   These regulations are intended to:
   (a)    Minimize the transmission from one land use to another of nuisances
associated with noise, dust, and glare.
   (b)    Minimize visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an
urbanized area. Minimal screening provides an impression of separation of
spaces, and more extensive screening can entirely shield the visual effects of
an intense land use from a less intense land use.
   (c)    Establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical
intrusion of intense land uses, the degree of privacy varying with the
intensity of the screening.
   (d)    Safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare, and preserve the
aesthetic qualities and enhance the community character.
1136.02  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that:
   (a)    Neighboring properties are shielded form adverse external effects of
that development, regardless of whether it is separated by a right-of-way.
   (b)    It provides a transition zone between dissimilar land uses.
1136.03 SCOPE.
   (a)    Except where more stringent standards or procedures are specified in
this Ordinance, the standards and procedures in this Chapter shall apply to all
required screening and buffering areas.
   (b)    For those zoning districts listed in the screening table in Section
1136.07 and those specific districts listed in this Chapter, there shall be
provided and maintained on the sides of the property abutting, adjacent to, or
across the street from a residential district a screening/buffer zone as
specified in this Chapter, unless otherwise waived or reduced by the Commission
or official approving the site plan.
   (c)    For utility buildings, stations, and/or substations, screening shall
be provided consisting of a six-foot-high wall, berm, or fence, except when all
equipment is contained within a building or structure which is comparable in
appearance to residential buildings in the surrounding area.
1136.04 PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   Whenever landscape, screening and/or a buffer zone are required in this
chapter, a preliminary landscape/screening plan shall be submitted to the
Administrative Official and a final plan approved by the Commission or other
official approving the site plan. The plan shall be prepared and sealed by an
architect, landscape architect or engineer, and shall contain the following:
   (a)    All applicable information required by this Ordinance for site plan
review.
   (b)    All applicable information listed in this Chapter pertaining to plant
materials.
   (c)    The location, general size, and type of existing vegetation to be
retained.
   (d)    Existing and proposed grades.
   (e)    A planting schedule and plan providing the following information:
      (i)    The botanical and common name of each plant used.
      (ii)    The size of each plant to be used at the time of planting.
      (iii)    The quantity of each plant to be used.
      (iv)    Whether plants to be used are balled and burlapped, container
grown or bare root.
      (v)    The spacing and location of all proposed trees, shrubs and ground
cover. Ground cover is defined as low-growing woody shrubs, deciduous or
evergreen plants, perennial plants and/or vines, such as cranberry, cotoneaster
(Cotoneaster apiculata), blue rug juniper (Juniperus horizantaus "Wiltoni"),
myrtle (Vinca minor), or Baltic ivy (Hedera helix "Baltica"). Grass, shredded
bark, wood chips, other similar mulch or landscaping stones are also acceptable
as ground cover for greenbelt areas.
   (f)    The percentage of landscaped area, excluding detention ponds, to be
provided on site.
1136.05 STANDARDS.
   (a)    The table in Section
1136.07 and explanation contained in this Chapter establish the screening
requirements which satisfy the general performance standards set forth in
Section
1136.02, unless modifications as permitted under Section
 1136.08 are applicable.
   (b)    The table in Section
 1136.07 indicates the type of screening that is required between two zoning
districts. Where such screening is required, only one of the two adjoining
zoning districts is responsible for installing the screening, as provided in
subsection (c) of this section.
   (c)    To determine if the zoning district being developed is required to
install the screening and which type of screening is required, find the zoning
district being developed and follow that column down the page to its
intersection with the row which corresponds to the adjoining zoning district.
If the intersecting square contains a letter, the zoning district being
developed is responsible for installing that level of screening. If the
intersecting square does not contain a letter, no screening improvement is
required.
1136.06  SCREENING REQUIREMENT.
   (a)    Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in
this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection,
except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
      (i)    Buffer means an area along and away from a property line within
which no structures, driveways, parking, signs or other such uses or structures
may be located unless specifically permitted in this Chapter.
      (ii)   Intermittent visual obstruction means a screen having no
completely unobscured openings within two years of planting more than 10 feet
wide at a specified height. In other words, tree canopies shall have grown
together within two years of planting to a point that the widest opening
between such canopies at a specified height shall not exceed 10 feet. The
screen may include deciduous plants and trees. Compliance of planted vegetative
screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature
height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of
existing vegetation.
      (iii)    Opaque screen means an opaque screen excluding all visual
contact between zoning districts and creating spatial separation. The opaque
screen may be composed of a wall, fence or earthen berm, and shall be
supplemented with planted and existing vegetation.
         (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
   (b)    Types of screening. The following types of screening are established
and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements in Section
1136.07. Whenever screening is required, the screening along a street or alley
shall be type C, with the provision that signs and access driveways are
permitted in the buffer area, as otherwise permitted by this Ordinance:
(Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
      (i)    Type A.
         (1)    Opaque screen height: at least six feet;
         (2)    Intermittent visual obstruction height: at least 20 feet,
measured from the ground; and
         (3)    Buffer width: at least 50 feet.
      (ii)    Type B.
         (1)    Opaque screen height: at least six feet;
         (2)    Intermittent visual obstruction height: at least 20 feet,
measured from the ground; and
         (3)    Buffer width: at least 25 feet.
      (iii)    Type C.
         (1)    Opaque screen height: none;
         (2)    Intermittent visual obstruction height: at least 20 feet,
measured from the ground; and
         (3)    Buffer width: at least 10 feet.
1136.07  TABLE OF SCREENING REQUIREMENT.
   The following table of screening requirements shall be used for the purposes
of this Chapter, with the abbreviations in the matrix relating to the zoning
districts in this chapter, and with the screening designations A, B, and C,
explained in Section
1136.06, above:

Notes:
*    Where property is being developed for use primarily as single family
residential dwelling units, no screening shall be required under this section.
1136.08 MODIFICATION OF SCREENING AND BUFFER ZONE REQUIREMENTS.
   Because of the wide variety of land uses and the relationships between them
and because of many different circumstances, the Commission may reduce or waive
the screening and buffer zone requirements of this Chapter after a detailed
review and evaluation of an alternative screening plan. Whenever the Commission
modifies the screening requirement, it shall find that the following standards
have been met:
   (a)    The landscape/screening plan shall protect the character of new and
existing residential neighborhoods against negative impacts such as noise,
glare, light, air pollution, trash and debris, and hazardous activities.
   (b)    The Commission shall determine the screening, width and type of
buffer zone needed to ensure compatibility based upon the following criteria:
      (i)    The development is compatible with and sensitive to the immediate
environment of the site and neighborhood relative to architectural design,
scale, bulk, building height, identified historical character, disposition and
orientation of buildings on the lot and visual integrity.
      (ii)    The site has natural existing vegetation and/or topography,
natural bodies of water or wetland areas or other existing conditions which
offer screening consistent with the standards set forth in this chapter. The
Commission shall require the retention of these natural features as a condition
of site plan approval.
      (iii)    The arrangement, design and orientation of buildings on this
site lends itself so as to maximize the opportunity for privacy and isolation
from negative impacts of this project.
1136.09 MATERIALS.
   Fences required under this Chapter shall be constructed of redwood, cedar,
or no. 1 pressure treated wood. Chainlink fences shall not be permitted for
screening or obscuring purposes.
 
1136.10  BERMS.
   (a)    Earth berms required under this Chapter shall consist of raised earth
with side slopes of three-to-one or flatter with a four-foot-wide flat or
slightly rounded crest contoured to the side slopes to facilitate maintenance.
 
   (b)    Berms shall be covered with grass or other ground cover to prevent
erosion. Berms shall also be landscaped with plant materials. A detailed
landscape plan with a plant material list, including quantity, species, minimum
size and spacing, shall be submitted with the site plan and approved by the
Commission.
1136.11 LOCATION OF SCREENING.
   Screening required under this chapter shall be located directly adjacent to
the lot line except where underground utilities interfere. Upon approval of the
Commission and when mutually agreeable to affected property owners, required
screening may be located on the opposite side of an alley right-of-way when a
nonresidential district abuts a residential district. The continuity of the
required screening on a given block shall be a major consideration of the
Commission in reviewing such request.
1136.12 OPENINGS IN WALLS, FENCES, AND BERMS; CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR WALLS.
   Walls, fences and berms required under this chapter shall have no openings
for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except such openings as may be
approved by the Commission. All walls required in this Chapter shall be
constructed of stone, brick or shall have brick veneer on the side facing the
residential district. The height of the wall shall be measured from the
prevailing grade of the land on the residential side of the wall or berm. Walls
shall be erected on a concrete foundation which shall have a minimum depth of
42 inches below a grade approved by the Administrative Official and shall not
be less than four inches wider than the wall to be erected.
1136.13 BUMPER STOPS, CURBING OR WHEEL CHOCKS IN PARKING SPACES.
   Bumper stops, curbing or wheel chocks shall be provided in parking spaces
adjacent to a wall, fence or berm required under this chapter to prevent a
vehicle from encroaching on or damaging the screening improvement. Bumper
stops, curbing or wheel chocks shall be placed four feet from the required
screening improvement.
1136.14 CORNER CLEARANCE VISIBILITY.
   The Administrative Official may require a reduction in the height of a
screening improvement where necessary to ensure adequate sight distance and/or
corner clearance visibility for drive approaches and public streets in
proximity to a screening improvement. In this case height may be reduced only
for that portion of the screening improvement necessary to provide adequate
sight distance and/or corner clearance necessary for traffic safety. Where it
is necessary to reduce the height of a screening improvement, height shall be
reduced gradually.
1136.15 IRRIGATION OF VEGETATION.
   Whenever a site plan requires landscaped earth berms or planted or natural
vegetation screening, such areas shall be provided with an irrigation system or
a readily available and acceptable water supply as approved by the
Administrative Official.
1136.16 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE.
   Whenever a site plan requires screening and/or landscaping, the applicant
shall deposit with the City a cash or corporate surety bond, irrevocable bank
letter of credit or any other security deemed acceptable by the City in the
full amount of such improvement for the faithful completion of such
improvement. When such screening improvement and/or landscaping requires
landscaped earth berms or planted or natural vegetation screening, such bond
shall continue for two years following the completion and inspection of all
planting to ensure that all unhealthy and dead plant material shall be
replaced, and the bond shall be released only after there has been a site
inspection and a determination made that the screening has been planted as
planned. The applicant shall provide a cost estimate on the site plan
indicating the full amount of such improvement.
1136.17 WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
   The Commission or official approving the site plan may waive or reduce the
requirements of this division upon determining that the following would apply:
   (a)    The purpose of this division cannot be met; and
   (b)    Compliance with the requirements would impose a practical difficulty
on the applicant or would create safety hazards to pedestrians or motorists.
1136.18 SCOPE OF PLANT MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Wherever in this Chapter screening, planting and/or material in conjunction
with an obscuring fence is required, it shall be planted within six months from
the date of issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy and shall
thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials to provide a
screen to abutting properties. Suitable materials equal in characteristics to
the plant materials listed in this Chapter with the spacing as required in this
Chapter shall be provided.
1136.19 PLANT MATERIAL SPACING.
   Spacing of plant materials required under this Chapter shall be as follows:
   (a)    Trees and large shrubs shall not be placed closer than four feet from
the fence line or property line.

1140.01  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance. Such
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variances
from requirements listed in this Ordinance other than lot area or lot width
shall be obtained only through action of the Board as provided in this
Ordinance.
1140.02 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
1140.03  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Any lawful nonconforming building or structure may be continued and
maintained, provided there is no physical change than necessary maintenance and
repair of such building or structure except as permitted hereinafter.
1140.04 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any lawful nonconforming use of land may be continued, provided that such
use of land shall not be expanded or extended either on the same or adjoining
property.
1140.05 RESTORATION OF DAMAGED BUILDING.
   A nonconforming building or structure having been damaged or partially
destroyed by fire or other calamity to an extent not exceeding 60 percent of
the assessed valuation, exclusive of foundations, at that time, may be restored
and its immediately previous occupancy or use, existing at the time of such
partial destruction, may be continued or resumed; provided the work of
restoration is commenced within one year of the date of such partial
destruction and is diligently carried on to completion. Whenever a
nonconforming building or structure is damaged in excess of 60 percent of its
assessed valuation, exclusive of foundations, at that time, the repair or
reconstruction of such building shall conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which it is located and it shall be treated as a new building.
1140.06 CHANGE OF USE.
   Any part of a building, structure, or land occupied by a nonconforming use
may be changed to a use of the same or a more restricted classification
(subject to such permits as may be required for proposed use); but where the
use of a nonconforming building, structure, or land is hereafter changed to a
more restricted classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of
less restricted classification.
1140.07  ABANDONED NONCONFORMING USES.
   In the event that a nonconforming use of land or use of building is
discontinued or abandoned, for a period of one year or more, the use of the
same shall conform thereafter to the uses permitted in the district in which it
is located. The Board shall have the authority to extend this period by not
more than two years, for a total of three years, based upon a showing by the
property owner of extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to the
pendency of any bankruptcy, foreclosure, other probate proceeding or other
judicial proceeding directly relating to the property.
1140.08 CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP.
   There may be a change of tenancy or ownership or management of an existing
lawful nonconforming use, provided there is no change in the nature or
character of such nonconforming use.
1140.09 COMPLETION OF PENDING CONSTRUCTION.
   The adoption of this Ordinance shall not limit the construction of any
building for which a valid site plan approval exists and/or for which a permit
had been obtained and on which work had commenced and had been carried on
continuously.
1140.10  EXPANSION PROHIBITED.
   A nonconforming use of a portion of a building or structure, which building
or structure otherwise conforms to the provisions of this Ordinance, shall not
be expanded or extended into any other portion of such conforming building or
structure, nor changed except to a conforming use. If the nonconforming use or
portion thereof is discontinued or changed to a conforming use, any future use
of such building, structure or portion thereof shall be in conformity to the
regulations of the district in which such building or structure is located.
1140.11 REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING USE, BUILDING OR STRUCTURE.
   The Commission may, from time to time, recommend to the Council the
acquisition of such private property as does not conform in use or structure to
the regulations and restrictions of the various districts defined in this
Ordinance and to recommend the removal of such use or structure in accordance
with applicable laws and statutes.
1140.12 NONCONFORMING USES DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION.
   The foregoing provisions shall also apply to uses which hereafter become
nonconforming due to any reclassification of districts or zones under this
Ordinance.
1140.13  RECORD OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Immediately after the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments
thereto, the City should prepare a record of nonconforming uses and occupations
of lands, buildings, and structures, including tents and trailer coaches,
existing at the time of such Ordinance or amendment. Such record should contain
the names and addresses of the owners of such nonconforming use and of any
occupant, other than the owner, the legal description of the land and the
nature and extent of use. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all
nonconformities in the City, but only those of which the Commission is aware.
The Commission should review the record and make such recommendations to the
Council as it deems advisable with reference to these nonconforming uses. The
record of nonconforming uses and recommendations of the Commission should be
filed in the office of the Clerk of Council and record should constitute prima
facie evidence of the number, character, and extent of the nonconformities at
the time this Ordinance or any amendment thereto becomes effective. The record
of nonconforming uses should be reviewed and revised annually as the Commission
shall prescribe.

1150.01 INTENT.
   The intent of this Chapter is to provide for adequate private passenger
vehicular and delivery truck storage space for different types of land uses
within the City and to set standards for the construction and use of these off-
street parking facilities. Within this Chapter, standards have been identified
for:
   (a)   The temporary storage of trucks with the primary intent of delivering
goods for storage and/or sale to the general public;
   (b)   The temporary storage of private passenger vehicles as a use
incidental to a principal use; and
   (c)   The temporary storage of private passenger vehicles as a principal use
of the site to serve an adjacent use district which has developed without
adequate off-street parking.
1150.02 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACE.
   On the same premises with every building, structure, or part thereof,
erected and occupied for manufacturing, storage, warehouse goods, display,
department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry,
dry cleaning, or other uses similarly involving the receipt or the distribution
of vehicles or materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained
on the lot, adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading services in
order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets or alleys.
Such space shall include a 10 foot by 55 foot loading space, with 14 foot
height clearance for every 10,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, in excess
of 2,000 square feet of building floor area for the above mentioned purposes. A
10 foot by 25 foot loading space with a 14 foot height clearance shall be
required for any of the above mentioned uses for 2,000 or less square feet of
building floor area.
1150.03 OFF-STREET PARKING DEVELOPMENT CONDITIONS.
   In all zoning districts, off-street parking facilities for the storage or
parking of self- propelled motor vehicles hereafter erected, altered or
extended after the effective date of this Ordinance shall be provided and
maintained as herein prescribed:
   (a)   The loading space as required in this Ordinance shall not be construed
as supplying any off-street parking space.
   (b)   When units or measurements used in determining the number of required
parking spaces result in requirement of fractional space, any fraction up to
and including one half shall be-disregarded and fractions over one-half shall
require one space.
   (c)   Whenever a use requiring off-street parking is increased in floor
area, and such use is located in a building existing on or before the effective
date of this Ordinance, additional parking space for additional floor area
shall be provided and maintained in amounts hereafter specified for that use;
provided, however, in the existing business districts where the City and
various property owners have or may cooperatively develop parking facilities,
and additional parking space as required for the increased floor space is not
available within the required 300 feet as required in this Ordinance, the
Commission may, through negotiations with the owner of such property, vary the
location of such required parking spaces or agree to the owner’s participation
in other authorized parking facilities which will furnish the same amount of
space as required for his increased floor space within a distance of not more
than 500 feet of the building.
   (d)   For the purpose of this Chapter, “floor area” in the case of offices,
merchandising, or service types of use, shall mean the gross floor area used or
intended to be used for services to the public as customers, patrons, clients,
or patients or as tenants, including areas occupied for fixtures and equipment
used for display or sale of merchandise.
   (e)   Off-street parking facilities for one- and two-family dwellings shall
be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building they are intended
to serve. The location of required off-street parking facilities for other than
one and two-family dwellings and all multiple dwellings shall be within 300
feet of the building they are intended to serve, measured from the nearest
point of the off-street parking facilities to the nearest point of the
building. This section shall not apply to colleges, universities, and other

1162.49 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS.
   (a)   Purpose. These regulations governing telecommunications towers are
established to provide for the construction, erection, extension and removal of
such towers in districts permitting residential uses in the City and are
related to certain applications of technology and engineering in the field of
telecommunications. The purpose of these regulations is to balance the
competing interests created by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996
(Public Law 104-104) and the interests of the City in regulating
telecommunications towers and related facilities for the following reasons:
      (i)   To provide for orderly development within the City;
      (ii)   To protect property values;
      (iii)   To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the City, including, but
not limited to, its residential character, local business areas, and scenic
views;
      (iv)   To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and the
commercial and institutional zoning districts from the adverse effects of
towers and related facilities;
      (v)   To promote collocation of telecommunications towers in order to
decrease the total number of towers in the City; and
      (vi)   To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare
of the residents and visitors of the City.
   (b)   Applicability. No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct,
change, alter, remove or enlarge a telecommunications tower in the City without
compliance with the provisions of this Section.
 
   (c)   Use Regulations.
      (i)   A telecommunications tower shall only be permitted by right in the
I-1 and I-2 Districts, and as a conditional use in the R-2, B-1, B-2, B-3, and
B-4 Districts. A telecommunication tower is not permitted in any other zoning
district in the City.
      (ii)   The installation of a telecommunication antenna(s), and the
expansion of an existing equipment shelter to serve such antenna(s), may be
permitted as a conditional use on an existing telecommunication tower in any
district.
      (iii)   The installation of a telecommunications antenna where the
construction or erection of a tower is not proposed by the applicant, shall be
permitted as an accessory use on existing towers, buildings or structures. To
the extent the remaining standards of this section are applicable to the
situation involving the installation of a telecommunications antenna(s) on an
existing tower, building or structure, such standards shall govern the
installation.
   (d)   Collocation.
      (i)   All applicants for construction or erection of telecommunications
towers shall be required to construct on a base tower structure and structure
foundation that is designed to be buildable up to, but not including, 200 feet
above grade. Such structure shall be designed to have sufficient structural
loading capacity to accommodate at least four antenna platforms or antenna
arrays of equal loading capacity for four separate providers of service to be
located on the structure when constructed to the maximum allowable height. The
telecommunications facility shall also be designed to show that the applicant
has enough space on its site plan for an equipment shelter large enough to
accommodate at least four separate users of the facility. If an equipment
shelter is initially constructed to accommodate only one user, space shall be
reserved on site for equipment shelter expansions to accommodate up to at least
four separate users. Agreement to the provisions of this subsection must be
included in the applicant's lease with the landowner, if different from the
owner/user of the tower. Written documentation must be presented to the
Commission evidencing that the landowner of the property on which the tower is
to be located has agreed to the terms of this subsection. As an additional
condition of issuing a conditional use permit, the owner/user shall respond in
writing to any inquiries regarding collocation of another user of the facility
within 30 days after receipt of a written inquiry. Copies of all written
requests to collocate and all written responses shall be sent to the
Commission.
      (ii)   The applicant requesting permission to install a new tower shall
provide evidence that there is no technically suitable space for the
applicant's antenna(s) and related facilities reasonably available on an
existing tower, building or structure within the geographic area to be served.
With its application, the applicant shall identify the location of every tower,
building or structure that could support the proposed antenna(s) or area where
it would be technically suitable to locate so as to allow it to serve its
intended function. As part of its application, the applicant shall provide a
scaled map of all of its existing, proposed or planned antenna locations within
a five-mile radius of the site which is the subject of the application.
   The applicant must demonstrate that a technically suitable location is not
reasonably available on an existing tower, building or structure. If an
existing tower, building or structure is technically suitable, the applicant
must demonstrate that it has made written request to collocate on the existing
tower, building or structure and the request was rejected by the owner of the
tower, building or structure. In all circumstances, owners of existing towers
shall promptly respond in writing to requests for collocation, but in no event
shall they respond more than 30 days from the date of receipt of a written
request for collocation. If another telecommunications tower is technically
suitable, the applicant must further show that it has offered to allow the
owner of that other tower to collocate an antenna(s) on another tower within
the City which is owned or controlled by the applicant, if available, on
commercially reasonable terms and the offer was not accepted.

1164.01  PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Land Suitability. If the Commission finds that land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding,
inadequate drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development susceptibility to mud slides or earthslides, severe erosion
potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal
capabilities, or any other feature harmful to the health, safety or welfare of
the future residents of the proposed subdivision or community, and if from
investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is determined
that in the best interests of the public the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems
that will be created by the development of the land.
1164.02 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The following improvements shall be required:
   (a)   Streets shall be provided according to the specifications of the City
Engineer and conforming to the latest edition of the ODOT Location and Design

north arrow, correct architectural or engineering dimensions and scale, zoning
and development of adjacent properties, location and type of buildings on the
site, location and type of yards, landscaping or fencing on the site, location
and type of storm drainage, and existing and final contours and building
elevations at one-foot intervals.
      (ii)   Such other information as may be needed in reviewing the plan to
determine how best to maintain the open space for its intended use, protect the
public safety, minimize adverse effects upon adjacent development, and preserve
historic sites.
1164.03  CONSTRUCTION, IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Drawings showing plans, cross sections, profiles, elevations, typical
sections, construction details, and specifications for all required
improvements shall be prepared by a professional engineer. The improvement

writing of the conditions requiring the modifications. Written authorization
from the Commission, upon approval by the City Engineer, to make the required
modification, must be received before proceeding with the construction of the
improvement.   
   At completion of the construction, and before acceptance, the subdivider
shall furnish the City Engineer a set of reproducible mylar drawings (excluding
sepia) for permanent record, showing the locations, sizes, and elevations of
improvements as constructed, and shall provide AutoCAD drawings of the entire
project containing the as-built information as well.
   (a)   Preconstruction Meeting and Work Schedules. Prior to the commencement
of any construction the subdivider shall notify, in writing, the Safety-Service
Director, all utilities, the Stark Soil and Water Conservation District, and
the City Engineer of the date of commencement of construction. A
preconstruction meeting shall be required with regard to procedure, materials,
and inspection of the project.
   (b)   Construction Inspections.
      (i)   Responsible Official. The City Engineer shall be responsible for
the inspection of all street improvements including storm sewers, water lines,
sanitary sewers, and sanitary treatment plants and appurtenances.
      (ii)   Authority and Duties of Inspectors.  Inspectors employed by the
City shall be authorized to inspect all work done and all materials furnished.
Such inspection may extend to all or any part of the work and to the
preparation, fabrication or manufacture of the materials to be used. The
inspector shall not be authorized to revoke, alter or waive any requirements of
the specifications or plans. The inspector shall be authorized to call the
attention of the contractor to any failure of the work or materials to conform
to the specifications and contract. The inspector shall have the authority to
reject materials which do not meet specification requirements or suspend the
portion of the work involved until any question at issue can be referred to and
decided by the City Engineer.
      (iii)   Final Inspection.  Upon completion of all the improvements, the
subdivider shall request in writing a final inspection by the City. The City
Engineer shall make a final inspection of all streets, storm sewers, water
lines, and sanitary sewers. Inspections shall be made promptly after the
request is made.
      (iv)   Before any roads developed as part of a subdivision become public,
the City Engineer shall first inspect such roads and certify his approval.
      (v)   The developer should have his representative present at the time of
all inspections.
   (c)   Construction Responsibilities.
      (i)   Cooperation of Subdivider and/or Contractor.  The subdivider and/or
contractor shall have available on the project, at all times, a clearly
readable copy of all required plans and specifications. He shall cooperate with
the inspector and with other contractors in every way possible. The subdivider
and/or contractor shall have a competent representative or superintendent
acting as his agent on the project. The superintendent shall be capable of
reading and thoroughly understanding the plans and specifications, and he shall
receive instructions from the inspector. The superintendent shall have full
authority to execute the orders or directions of the inspector and to promptly
supply such materials, tools, plans, equipment, and labor as may be required.
The inspector’s orders should be executed without delay. A superintendent shall
be furnished irrespective of the amount of work sublet.
      (ii)   Grade stakes. Pavement and pipe grade stakes shall be set at 25
foot intervals on horizontal and vertical curves and for all grades less than
one percent. Tangent pavement grades and pipe grades over one percent may be
set at a maximum interval of 50 feet. The inspector may ask for additional
grade stakes if it is deemed necessary. Other means of line and grade may be
used as approved by the City Engineer.
      (iii)   Repair of Damage.  Any damage done to the improvements by
construction traffic, local traffic, or by any other means shall be repaired or
the damaged materials replaced in a satisfactory condition.
      (iv)   Erosion Control. The subdivider and/or contractor shall take
necessary procedures to prevent soil erosion and downwash of grits and
sediments onto adjoining properties or into existing drainage facilities. The
City Engineer may request stoppage of work during construction if proper
controls for soil erosion, siltation, and sedimentation are not being provided
by the developer or contractor. The City Engineer may take the necessary steps
to provide corrective measures, and the cost of such services will be charged
to the developer. This does not relieve the developer or contractor of
downstream liabilities. No project will be released from bond from failure to
comply with this regulation and without cleanup and repair of damages. Final
inspection requires all drainage facilities free from depositions of erosion,
siltation, and construction debris.
      (v)   Final Cleaning Up.  Upon completion of the work and before
acceptance, the subdivider and/or contractor shall clean all ground occupied or
affected in connection with the work. The entire area shall be left in a neat
and presentable condition.

1168.01  PURPOSE.
   The intent of this policy is to establish consistent, technically feasible
and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm water
management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
City.
   Flooding and streambank erosion in the City are a significant threat to
public health and safety and public and private property, and storm water
quantity control slows runoff and reduces its erosive force, and flood damage.
Therefore, these measures shall be taken to help assure that development site
owners control the volume and rate of storm water runoff originating from their
property so that surface water and ground water are protected, soil erosion is
controlled, and flooding potential is not increased.
1168.02 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   This policy outlines the basic requirements of Storm Water Management Plans.
It is not intended as an all inclusive list of work required to prepare the
plans, specifications, reports, and calculations for such projects. The
Designer shall follow generally accepted standards for surveyors, architects,
and/or engineers.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
1168.03  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REPORT REQUIRED.
   All new and redeveloped commercial sites, industrial sites, condominium
developments, planned urban developments, and subdivisions are required to
submit a Storm Water Management Report to the City Engineer. The Storm Water
Management Report must be signed and stamped by a Registered Professional
Engineer licensed to practice in the State.
   An owner of a development site that was created by demolishing an older
existing structure can request, in writing, that the City Engineer exempt him
or her from the storm water issues if the total soil surface area being made
impermeable is the same or less than the total soil surface area that was
impermeable prior to the structure(s) being torn down and removed.
1168.04  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The policies contained herein outline the requirements for a Storm Water
Management Report. Not all of the sections of this outline may apply to a
proposed development. It will depend on the size of the proposed development,
the existing site conditions, and the proposed land use of the development.
   These guidelines shall not limit the right of the City Engineer to impose at
any time additional, more stringent requirements based on the site
circumstances. Nor, shall these guidelines limit the right of the City Engineer
to waive, in writing, individual requirements based on the site circumstances.
   The Storm Water Management Report should be submitted with the Site Plan for
commercial and industrial sites. It should be submitted with the Construction
Drawings for condominium developments, planned developments, and subdivisions.
Questions regarding the Storm Water Management Report should be directed to the
City Engineer.
   The Report should contain a description of the existing conditions on site,
land usage, ground cover conditions, soil types, etc. The Report should explain
the proposed improvements and the intent of the storm water management measures
being proposed. The Report should be prepared in a neat and organized manner.
The Report should provide maps and drawings, as necessary, to support the
Report’s calculations. The Report should verify that the information contained
on such maps and drawings corresponds to the information provided in the rest
of the Report.
   As a minimum general requirement, the proposed storm water management
measures shall be designed such that the runoff from the site shall not flood
existing or proposed structures, cause the loss of property, endanger
individuals, or cause the loss of life.
   Upstream runoff from outside the development area should be conveyed through
the site as closely as possible with the current runoff conditions. Existing
drainage features such as swales, ditches, creeks, and ravines, conveying
upstream runoff shall remain. Easements for drainage features shall be provided
as outlined herein.
   Provide positive grading for runoff for all lots and groups of lots within
condominium developments, planned developments, and subdivisions, as well as
for the overall site. Runoff for all development sites and individual lots
within a development shall be conveyed in an approved manner to an adequate and
appropriate discharge point (except as provided for permanent retention areas).
   Wherever possible and practical, a developer is encouraged to use measures
to slow the storm water runoff rate by increasing friction. Some examples are
discharging roof water to vegetated areas on site, using grass and rock-lined
drainage channels, and creating grass strips between areas of sheet flow runoff
such as parking lots. Additionally, developers are encouraged to reduce the
total runoff volume by means of infiltration. Some examples are infiltration
basins, infiltration trenches, dry basins, and the use of retention basins
instead of detention basins.
 
1168.05 STORM SEWER SYSTEMS AND ROADWAY DRAINAGE.
   Storm Sewer Systems and Roadway Drainage including catch basins, pipes,
culverts, swales, ditches, and other open channels shall be designed in
accordance with the latest editions of the Ohio Department of Transportation’s
Location and Design Manual, Volume Two - Drainage Design and Construction and
Material Specifications.
   (a)   Provide spreadsheet calculations for the storm sewer systems. All
storm sewer systems shall be designed to flow just full for a 10 year frequency
storm except where more stringent requirements are noted in the Location and
Design Manual. For roadway pipe design, check the hydraulic grade line does not
exceed the grate elevations based on a 25 year frequency storm.
   (b)   Provide spreadsheet calculations for the inlet spacing and pavement
spread. Allowable pavement spread shall be six feet for a 10 year frequency
storm.
   (c)   Open channels such as swales, ditches, channels, and ravines which are
used as part of the Major Flood Path, as described in Section
1168.06, shall have more stringent design requirements.
      (i)   Provide channel linings and bank stabilization to prevent erosion
in all open channels. Adhere to minimum ditch slope standards and maximum
velocity standards outlined in the Location and Design Manual.
      (ii)   Provide easements over open channels as described in Section
1168.08.
   (d)   Provide a Storm Sewer Systems and Roadway Drainage drawing. Perform
field surveying as necessary to insure that this drawing is an accurate
representation of actual field conditions. The scale of this drawing must be
sufficient to clearly present the following information:
      (i)   Existing and proposed elevation contours at an interval of two feet
or less. Contour lines shall be labeled frequently enough to be easily read and
interpreted.
      (ii)   All of the individual surface areas that drain to each
intercepting structure of the storm sewer system must be outlined. The areas
must be numbered or labeled to match the computer spreadsheet.
      (iii)   The path used to calculate the time of concentration for each
individual drainage area where the time of concentration is greater than 10
minutes. Indicate the types of flow and provide calculations.
      (iv)   Indicate various types of surface areas within each of the
individual drainage areas that have different runoff coefficient values. Use
different colors of shading or another method as long as the information can be
easily understood and read. Show how the weighted runoff coefficient for each
individual drainage area was calculated.
   (e)   An adequate downstream outlet must be provided for all proposed storm
sewers, such as an existing ditch, stream, river, storm sewer, pond or lake.
The downstream outlet must be able to accommodate the flow of storm water from
the proposed storm sewer system.
   (f)   Provide headwalls, energy dissipaters, riprap, erosion control mats,
and other measures, as necessary, at all outlets to prevent erosion.
   (g)   For storm sewers intended to become publicly owned (such as storm
sewers within roadways for a proposed subdivision), the following apply:
      (i)   Storm sewers less than or equal to 24 inch diameter shall be
constructed using high strength vitrified clay pipe, reinforced concrete pipe,
or PVC with bell and spigot joints.
      (ii)   Storm sewers greater that 24 inch diameter shall be constructed
using high strength vitrified clay pipe or reinforced concrete pipe only.
      (iii)   All sewers within dedicated (or proposed dedicated) right-of-way
or within a one-to-one slope from the right-of-way shall use crushed stone or
gravel, ODOT 703.11, Type 1 backfill that meets the gradation of ODOT 304, or
other approved premium backfill, as approved by the City Engineer.
      (iv)   Use ODOT MH-3 with City standard castings. Alternatively, use City
brick manhole standards with City standard castings.
      (v)   Use City of Alliance standard catch basins and castings.
      (vi)   Storm sewer mains shall be designed to be in the center of one
lane of pavement where possible (for example: sanitary sewer down the middle of
road, waterline in the lane on one side of the road, and storm sewer in the
lane on the other side of the road). Any variance from this must be approved by
the City Engineer.
      (vii)   If it is necessary, the City may approve sewers off road or
through a yard. In such instances, an easement with a minimum width of 20 feet
shall be required. (Wider easements may be required for large or deep sewers,
or based on terrain and topography.) Provide a gravel access drive, or gravel
base topped with topsoil, per City standards, for the length and width of the
easement for maintenance vehicle access.
      (viii)   Where culverts are required under the roadway, they shall extend
across the entire right-of-way of the street. The minimum pipe diameter of a
culvert shall be 18 inches. Headwalls shall be required.
      (ix)   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of 20 feet, and a
minimum diameter of 12 inches. The driveway culverts shall be laid so as to
maintain the flow lines of the ditch or gutter. Headwalls may be required by
the City Engineer.
   (h)   Roof Drains and Sump Pump Discharges. (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
      (i)   Roof drains may be discharged through the curb onto the street.
They may tie directly into the storm system by an approved wye or tap
connection, or by an approved core into a catch basin. Roof drains may be run
to a designed dry well, infiltration basin, or infiltration ditch. They may
discharge onto the ground using splash blocks. The downspouts must be run far
enough away from the building to meet building codes and the ground must have
positive grade away from the building. Roof drains are not permitted to
discharge on the ground where the flow may cause flooding to adjacent
properties, nor are they permitted to discharge across the back of any public
sidewalk, street, or other public ground within the City.
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
      (ii)   Sump pumps may be discharged in the same manner as roof drains,
except they are not permitted to discharge through the curb onto the street.
Sump pump discharges tied directly to the storm sewer must be accounted for in
the design of the storm sewer system.
 
1168.06 MAJOR FLOOD PATH.
   (a)   The intent of planning a major flood path is to ensure that the storm
water runoff, which exceeds the capacity of the storm sewer system, shall have
a route to follow which will not cause the loss of property or life.
 
   (b)   The combination of the major flood path and sewer/ditch system shall
have the capacity to carry runoff from a 100-year frequency storm. Where the
street is designated as the major drainage way, the depth of flow shall not
exceed eight inches at the face of curb. When the major drainage way is located
outside a street right-of-way, utility and floodway easements shall be provided
and a grading plan is to be submitted with detailed elevations showing the
flood being contained in this area.
 
   (c)   Minimum garage, first floor and minimum window opening elevations
along all 100-year flow routes are to be set by the design engineer. These
elevations are to be a minimum of one foot above the 100-year water elevation.
These elevations are to be clearly labeled on the plans and the subdivision
plat.
 
   (d)   Since streets may be used as a routing path, the major system must be
taken into account in the initial design of the development. It shall be
designed in such a manner as to direct the storm water into the detention or
retention area. Calculations indicating the capacity of the Major Flood Path
and the excess storm water runoff from the sewer/ditch system shall be
provided.
 
1168.07  STORM WATER RUNOFF CONTROL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Storm Water Runoff from a developed site such shall be controlled to
meet the following criteria:
      (i)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall
not be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the
two, five, 10, 25, 50, and 100 year storms with a 24 hour duration.
      (ii)   Runoff Rate During Construction: The peak runoff rate from the
development area shall not be greater during construction than it was before
development. This includes time of clearing and grading the entire site and
periods when lots are stripped for building construction. The applicant shall
provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates during
construction from the two, five, and 10 year storm with a 24 hour duration.
      (iii)   Runoff Volume: Where there is an inadequate receiving stream,
when discharging into the City storm sewer system, or where there is sufficient
potential for downstream flooding, as determined by the City Engineer, the site
runoff rate may be restricted further based on the runoff volumes. Increases in
the runoff volume shall be offset by further restricting runoff rates. Based on
the increase in runoff volume, the applicant shall determine the critical storm
for the development area. The runoff rate from the critical storm shall be
restricted to the two year pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical
storm shall be calculated as follows:
         (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from either the one-year or
the two-year frequency, 24-hour storm, occurring on the development area before
and after development. (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
         (2)   From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation ((Q
after minus Q before) divided by Q before) x 100 and, using this percentage,
select the critical storm from the following table: (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-
09.)
 
CRITICAL STORM SELECTION
The Percentage Increase in volume of Runoff is:
 
Equal To Or Greater Than And Less Than The 24-Hour "Critical Storm" for
                                       Discharge will be
0                        20            2 years
20                       50            5 years
50                       100           10 years
100                      250           25 years
250                      500           50 years
500                      ---           100 years
      (iv)   Detention or Retention Basin Exemption for Redevelopment or for
Expansion of Existing Facilities:
         (1)   For any development regulated by this ordinance, the
construction of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the
development if the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24
hour storm increases the existing peak discharge by one cubic foot per second
or less using the Soil Conservation Service method of calculation or other
method approved by the City Engineer. The City Engineer can waive this
requirement if existing storm sewers and drainage structures can safely handle
the expected increase in flow.
         (2)   Only one exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
      (v)   The flow of storm water from the developed site must not cause
flooding to any proposed buildings within the development or to existing
downstream homes, buildings, places of business or other such improvements.
      (vi)   Surface water draining from an existing watershed area cannot be
diverted, channeled, piped or otherwise rerouted into another watershed area
unless approved by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Two methods for calculating storm water runoff volumes and control
measures are approved. They are the Modified Rational Method and the Soil
Conservation Service Method. Either may be used for sites up to six acres in
size. The Soil Conservation Method must be used for all sites six acres or
larger.
   (c)   Provide a drainage area map (or maps) for the pre-developed and post-
developed sites. Perform field surveying as necessary to insure that this
drawing is an accurate representation of actual field conditions. The scale of
this drawing must be sufficient to clearly present the following information:
      (i)   Existing and proposed elevation contours at an interval of two feet
or less. Contour lines shall be labeled frequently enough to be easily read and
interpreted.
      (ii)   Hydrologic boundaries of watersheds, including areas outside the
proposed development that flow into the project area.
      (iii)   Points of analysis, or the location where the drainage is being
evaluated, for each watershed.
      (iv)   Path used to calculate the time of concentration for each
watershed. Indicate types of flow and provide calculations.
      (v)   Delineate and label the types of land use, surface features, ground
cover, soil types, etc. used to determine the runoff coefficients or curve
numbers for the project areas.
      (vi)   Show areas of existing ponds, springs, wetlands, streams, and
hydrologically sensitive areas within 1,000 feet of the proposed development.
      (vii)   Show existing and proposed storm water features such as ditches,
swales, inlets, pipes, roadways, etc. within 500 feet of the proposed
development, unless the ultimate outfall system is a lesser distance.
      (viii)   Show the proposed development layout.
   (d)   Calculations.
      (i)   Provide routing calculations and their corresponding inflow and
outflow hydrographs for the two-year storm up through the 100 year storm.
Prepare a summary table of results of the routing calculations. The table shall
include, at a minimum, peak inflow, peak outflow, water surface elevations, and
storage volume requirements.
      (ii)   Provide pond volume vs. elevation summaries.
      (iii)   Provide calculations for the inlet/outlet works including weirs,
orifices, culverts, spillways, grates, etc. Show their capacities and stage-
discharge calculations, including tailwater assumptions.
      (iv)   Verify capacities of receiving drainage features such as ditches,
storm sewers, pond, streams, etc. to verify sufficient capacity to accommodate
the runoff of the development. The receiving drainage feature must be approved
by the City. Check all storms with a return frequency of 100 years or less.
Determine flooding potential for surrounding homes, commercial businesses and
industries.
      (v)   Provide runoff coefficients or curve number calculations for each
watershed or sub-area, including impervious calculations.
      (vi)   Provide time of concentration calculations for each watershed or
sub-area.
      (vii)   Calculate hydraulic grade line for outlet structures with pipes.
      (viii)   Determine velocities of discharged waters and show details to
control erosion.
      (ix)   Provide calculations for water quality and erosion control
measures as required for the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) (See
Section
1168.09).
      (x)   Provide narratives, as needed, to describe the methods,
assumptions, formulas, and intent of the calculations.
   (e)   Detention Basins.
      (i)   The minimum length to width ratio of the basin shall be two-to-one.
      (ii)   The grading of the detention basin shall be such that it reflects
the surrounding topography. The embankment slopes for the detention basin
should be four feet horizontal to one foot vertical preferred or a maximum of
two feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
      (iii)   The maximum water depth shall not exceed 10 feet.
         (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
      (iv)   The minimum top width of the side embankments shall be five feet
for non- vehicular traffic and 12 feet for vehicular traffic. The embankment
shall be set at an elevation at least 12 inches above the emergency spillway
and at least 18 inches above the peak 100 year pond elevation.
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
      (v)   Outlet structures using weir type flow regulators are preferred to
reduce the risk of clogging.
      (vi)   Principal outlet (or outlets in a multi-stage configuration) shall
have the capacity to pass the 100 year design storm flow.
      (vii)   Outlet pipes shall have a minimum diameter of six inches. Orifice
plates must be used for restrictions of smaller diameter. Consideration should
be given to removable trash racks or other means to prevent clogging.
      (viii)   Access to entire outlet structure for maintenance and inspection
shall be provided and shall follow current OSHA standards.
      (ix)   An emergency spillway shall be provided and set at an elevation
equal to 6 inches above the peak 100 year pond elevation. The spillway length
shall be 10 feet at its narrowest point (may be less for very small ponds, as
approved by the City). The location of the emergency spillway shall be such
that its overflow can be directed to an acceptable location. Permanent erosion
control measures at the emergency spillway may be required by the City based on
potential erosion at the site.
      (x)   Detention structures shall be graded to drain to the outlet
structure. The minimum grade in the pond shall be two percent. No paved gutters
shall be used as the low flow channel.
      (xi)   A permanent easement shall be provided a minimum of 20 feet beyond
the detention basin’s outside perimeter. See Section
1168.08.
      (xii)   A 20 foot permanent easement shall be provided from the pond to
the closest public street or alley. Provide a gravel access drive, or gravel
base topped with topsoil, per City standards, for the length and width of the
easement. See Section
1168.08.
      (xiii)   All pipes through the embankment shall have anti-seep collars.
      (xiv)   Soils borings and testing shall be performed by an approved soils
testing laboratory. Submit a report certifying suitability of the soils on-site
for embankment and basin construction. If soils are highly permeable, a six
inch clay layer, or other measures may be required.
      (xv)   Where the detention basin outlet flows onto private property or
onto property owned by a government other than the City (such as the State of
Ohio right-of-way), a discharge easement agreement (or Government permit) with
that property owner must be prepared and executed. Proof of such easement shall
be presented prior to the City’s approval of the drainage.
         (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
(xvi)   Show dimensions of the detention basin on the plans that meet or exceed
calculated pond values.
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
   (f)   Retention Basins. All of the criteria for the Detention Basins shall
apply, with the following additional requirements:
      (i)   The grading of the Retention Basin shall be such that it reflects
the surrounding topography. The embankment slopes for the Retention Basin shall
be four feet horizontal to one foot vertical leading to the pond. It shall
terminate at an aquatic safety bench.
      (ii)   The aquatic safety bench shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide with a
maximum slope of three percent. The aquatic safety bench shall have a maximum
water depth of one foot. Side slopes beyond the aquatic safety bench shall not
be steeper than two feet horizontal to one foot vertical under the water.
      (iii)   Additionally, the developer or designer may add a second dry
safety bench meeting the same width and slope requirements. Having a dry safety
bench does not eliminate the requirement of an aquatic safety bench.
      (iv)   Retention basins must have a minimum of 10 acres draining to pond,
or as approved by the City.
      (v)   Provide aeration equipment of adequate size for the pond to prevent
the water from becoming stagnant.
      (vi)   Provide piping and valves necessary to completely drain the pond
periodically for maintenance.
   (g)   Bio-Retention basins may be required whenever the proposed detention/
retention facility discharges into an existing wetland, a creek or as required
by the City. The design of the Bio-Retention basin is to follow the guidelines
shown in Design of Stormwater Wetland Systems, prepared by Thomas R. Schueler.
The manual can be obtained from the Metropolitan Washington Council of
Governments. The allowable side slopes shall follow the Detention Basin
requirements of these standards. The plant materials shall be suitable for the
environment created.
   (h)   In certain applications, alternative detention facilities may be
permitted and encouraged. These methods may be especially useful on small sites
or where the increase in runoff is small. They may also be useful in
conjunction with these methods described above. Requests for alternative
detention facilities shall be submitted to the City within the appropriate
design standards.
      (i)   Infiltration basin, dry wells, and infiltration ditches.
         (1)   Soils borings and testing shall be performed by an approved
soils testing laboratory. Submit a report certifying the suitability of the
soils on-site for infiltration.
         (2)   Infiltration measures must make provisions for overflow to a
suitable area.
      (ii)   Underground Detention Tanks or Pipes   
         (1)   May be used for commercial or industrial sites only.
         (2)   Must provide access for inspection and maintenance.
         (3)   Must have sufficient load bearing capacity.
         (4)   Must have a minimum bottom slope of 0.5 percent.
      (iii)   For very small sites (under two acres) detention in parking lots
using catch basins.
         (1)   A maximum water depth of eight inches in parking areas may be
used. Beyond such depth, an overflow or outlet must be provided.
         (2)   Maximum water depth shall not exceed the finished floor
elevations of existing or proposed structures.
         (3)   Slopes for parking lots used for this purpose shall be a minimum
of one percent and a maximum of 10 percent.
      (iv)   If none of these practices are applicable, the City reserves the
right to waive storm water management requirements for developments under two
acres. This may only be done after the designer has shown that all other
options are not feasible.
   (i)   Maintenance of Storm Water Management Practices.
      (i)   An as-built survey must be completed by qualified registered
engineer or surveyor and submitted to the City showing the location, detention
volume (include depth and capacity) of all stormwater practices.
      (ii)   The City Engineer and/or Safety-Service Director shall approve an
inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of land
served by the planned storm water management practices before the City accepts
the final plat of the proposed project.
      (iii)   All inspection and maintenance agreements shall do the following:
         (1)   Designate the party responsible for maintenance of structural
and nonstructural storm water management practices including mowing and
ensuring outlet structures are clear and in good repair. Unless otherwise
approved by the City, this shall be an entity of common ownership within the
proposed subdivision (such as an Association) or the owner on an industrial or
commercial site.
         (2)   Prohibit unauthorized alterations of structural and
nonstructural storm water management practices.
         (3)   Provide access to storm water management practices for
inspection by the City to document the condition of the practices. Authorize
the City to make corrections to the facility, if deemed necessary, and assess
the affected property owners. See Sec.
1168.07(j) below.
      (iv)   The location, dimensions, and bearing (including the depth and
capacity) of all storm water management practices shall be incorporated on the
final plat, prior to approval by the City, and reference thereon shall be made
to the entity or individual(s) responsible for maintenance.
   (j)   Inspection of Storm Water Management Practices.
      (i)   The City may inspect storm water management practices periodically.
      (ii)   Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the City

plans, conditional uses, variances, appeals, amendments, permits, certificates,
fees, violations, penalties, and records within the City.
1180.02 MINOR SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Minor Subdivision Review Required.  Whoever subdivides land, as
defined in this Ordinance, whether by instrument of conveyance or otherwise,
for which no plat is required by reason of Sec. 711.001 and 711.131 of the
Revised Code, shall submit such subdivision, together with a sketch identifying
such subdivision, to the Commission for review and approval. The Commission may
delegate its authority under this section to the Administrative Official or
staff.
   (b)   Submission of Minor Subdivision for Review by Commission. In order to
initiate formal review by the Commission, the applicant is required to submit
the following materials to the Administrative Official:
      (i)   One completed and signed copy of an application for Commission
Review;
      (ii)   20 individually folded copies of the minor subdivision plan;
      (iii)   Completed and signed checklist;
      (iv)   One 8-1/2 by 11 inch size, or 11 by 17 inch size, reduced copy of
the minor subdivision plan;
      (v)   Evidence that the plan has been submitted for review to affected
and applicable county, state, and federal agencies; and
      (vi)   The required review fee.
   These materials must be submitted to the Administrative Official in
sufficient time to allow review by City staff and consultants prior to the
Commission meeting at which the review will occur, if any. The plans and
required documentation must be submitted to the City on the 20th day of the
month prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting for consideration for
review by the Commission. The Administrative Official has the authority to
determine what is “sufficient time”, based on the scope and complexity of the
proposal.
   (c)   Distribution of Plans. Upon submission of all required application
materials and following completion of all items required by the adopted minor
subdivision review manual, the proposed minor subdivision shall be placed on
the next open Commission agenda. The minor subdivision and application shall be
distributed by the Administrative Official to appropriate City officials and
the City Engineer and City Planner for review.
   (d)   Review and Action.
      (i)   Informal Review of Conceptual Plans by City Staff. Applicants are
encouraged to meet with the City Staff, including but not limited to the
Planning and Development Director, City Engineer, City Planner, and such other
persons as determined by the Administrative Official, for informal review of
conceptual minor subdivisions. The purpose of this informal review is to
discuss applicable standards and technical issues, comment on the project’s
compliance with the standards of this Ordinance, and determine the appropriate
type of review process. The applicant or City Engineer or City Planner may also
request input from other City staff or consultants. Conceptual plans should, at
minimum, include the proposed lots, blocks, existing conditions, existing
streets, general site layout, and conceptual grading. Conceptual minor
subdivision review comments are non-binding, and should be considered by the
applicant to be suggestions and recommendations only. A review fee may be
required for conceptual minor subdivision review, as determined by City.
      (ii)   Informal Review by the Commission. The Commission may request an
informal workshop and formal regular or special meetings on a proposed project.
The meeting at which a minor subdivision proposal is considered shall be a
workshop meeting of the Commission. The Commission shall review the reports of
the appropriate City staff and consultants and discuss the findings and
recommendations with the applicant. No formal action on a minor subdivision
will occur at the workshop meeting.
      (iii)   Request for Revisions. Upon review of the minor subdivision
proposal at a workshop, the Commission may require the applicant to revise the
plans or supply additional information. The applicant shall submit any
requested revised plans for review prior to formal action being taken. All
review fees must be paid prior to any review. It shall be the applicant’s
responsibility to consult with City staff and consultants during this revision
process. Action on the minor subdivision shall remain tabled until the next
regular Commission meeting following review of a substantially complete plan at
a Commission workshop.
      (iv)   Public Hearing.  A minor subdivision involving use(s) subject to
conditional use approval, planned residential development, or planned unit
developments, shall require a public hearing. After payment of appropriate
fees, the Administrative Official may set the date of the public hearing for a
regular or special meeting of the Commission. No hearing may held before the
Commission has had an opportunity to review the plan at a workshop session.
      (v)   Final Action.  The Commission shall review the minor subdivision,
together with any reports and recommendations from staff, consultants and other
reviewing agencies and any public comments. The Commission shall then make a
determination based on the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The
Commission is authorized to table, approve, approve subject to conditions or
deny the minor subdivision as follows:
         (1)   Table. Upon determination by the Commission that a minor
subdivision is not sufficiently complete for approval or denial, or upon a
request by the applicant, the Commission may table the item until a later
meeting.
         (2)   Denial. Upon determination that a minor subdivision does not
comply with the standards and regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or would
require extensive revisions to comply with said standards and regulations, the
minor subdivision shall be denied. If a minor subdivision is denied, a written
record shall be provided to the applicant listing the reasons for such denial.
Failure of the applicant or the applicant’s designated representative, to
attend two or more scheduled meetings shall be grounds for the Commission to
deny approval of the minor subdivision.
         (3)   Approval.  Upon determination that a minor subdivision is in
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable
ordinances and laws, the minor subdivision shall be approved.
         (4)   Approval subject to conditions. The Commission may approve a
minor subdivision, subject to one or more conditions necessary to address minor
modifications to the minor subdivision, ensure that public services and
facilities can accommodate the proposed use, protect significant natural
features, ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses, or otherwise meet the
intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
   The Commission may require that the applicant re-submit the minor
subdivision for final approval by the Commission after conditions have been
met. The Commission may waive its right to review the revised plan, and
delegate authority to the Administrative Official or staff to review and
approve a revised minor subdivision on the Commission’s behalf after required
conditions have been addressed. The Commission may require that the

encouraged to meet with the City Staff, including but not limited to the City
Engineer, City Planner, and such other persons as determined by the
Administrative Official, for informal review of conceptual site plans. The
purpose of this informal review is to discuss applicable standards and
technical issues, comment on the project’s compliance with the standards of
this Ordinance, and determine the appropriate type of review process. The
applicant or City Planner may also request input from other City staff or
consultants. Conceptual plans should, at minimum, include the proposed use,
building footprint, existing conditions, general site layout and conceptual
grading. Conceptual plan review comments are non-binding, and should be
considered by the applicant to be suggestions and recommendations only. A
review fee may be required for conceptual plan review, as determined by City.

supply additional information. The applicant shall submit any requested revised
plans for review prior to formal action being taken. All review fees must be
paid prior to any review. It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to consult
with City staff and consultants during this revision process. Action on the
site plan shall remain tabled until the next regular Commission meeting
following review of a substantially complete plan at a Commission workshop.
      (iv)   Public Hearing.  A site plan involving use(s) subject to
conditional use approval, planned residential development, or planned unit
developments, shall require a public hearing. After payment of appropriate
fees, the Administrative Official may set the date of the public hearing for a
regular or special meeting of the Commission. No hearing may held before the
Commission has had an opportunity to review the plan at a workshop session.
      (v)   Final Action. The Commission shall review the site plan, together
with any reports and recommendations from staff, consultants and other
reviewing agencies and any public comments. The Commission shall then make a
determination based on the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The
Commission is authorized to table, approve, approve subject to conditions or
deny the site plan as follows:
         (1)   Table. Upon determination by the Commission that a site plan is
not sufficiently complete for approval or denial, or upon a request by the
applicant, the Commission may table the item until a later meeting.
         (2)   Denial. Upon determination that a site plan does not comply with
the standards and regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or would require
extensive revisions to comply with said standards and regulations, the site
plan shall be denied. If a site plan is denied, a written record shall be
provided to the applicant listing the reasons for such denial. Failure of the
applicant, or the applicant’s designated representative, to attend two or more
scheduled meetings shall be grounds for the Commission to deny approval of the
site plan.
         (3)   Approval. Upon determination that a site plan is in compliance
with the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and
laws, the site plan shall be approved.
         (4)   Approval subject to conditions. The Commission may approve a
site plan, subject to one or more conditions necessary to address minor
modifications to the site plan, ensure that public services and facilities can
accommodate the proposed use, protect significant natural features, ensure
compatibility with adjacent land uses, or otherwise meet the intent and purpose
of this Ordinance.
   The Commission may require that the applicant re-submit the site plan for
final approval by the Commission after conditions have been met. The Commission
may waive its right to review the revised plan, and delegate authority to the
Administrative Official or staff to review and approve a revised site plan on
the Commission’s behalf after required conditions have been addressed. The
Commission may require that the Administrative Official secure a favorable
recommendation from the City Planner and/or City Engineer prior to final
approval of the revised plan.
   (f)   Recording of Site Plan Action.  Commission action on the site plan
shall be recorded in the Commission meeting minutes, stating the name and
location of the project, the proposed use, the most recent plan revision date,
and the conditions or grounds for the Commission’s action.
   (g)   Procedure after Site Plan Approval.
      (i)   Approval Expiration. Site plan approval becomes null and void if
substantial construction has not commenced within 365 days following the final
approval of the site plan by the Commission, or if construction has not been
completed within 12 months after it commenced following the issuance of a
building permit. In such a case, the applicant shall file a new application.
Review by the Commission of the new application and site plan shall be
required.
      (ii)   Approval Extensions. Upon written request of the applicant, prior
to the expiration of a previously granted approval, the Commission may review
the circumstances surrounding a failure to meet the required deadlines. The
Commission may grant an extension of up to 12 months to an approval, if it
finds that the approved site plan continues to adequately represent current
conditions on and surrounding the site and that the site plan conforms to the
standards of this Ordinance in effect at the time of the applicant’s request
for an extension.
      (iii)   Site Maintenance after Approval. It shall be the responsibility
of the owner of a property for which site plan approval. Any property owner who
fails to maintain an approved site plan in full compliance with approvals
granted by the Commission according to the provisions of this Ordinance, shall
be deemed in violation of the use provisions of this Ordinance and shall be
subject to the penalties stated herein.
      (iv)   Outside Agency Permits or Approvals. The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining all necessary permits or approvals from applicable
outside agencies.
      (v)   Revocation. An approved site plan may be revoked by the Commission
if construction on the site is not completed or is not progressing in a manner
consistent with the approved plans. In such a case, the site plan shall be
placed on the agenda of a Commission meeting for a public hearing. The
Administrative Official shall cause written notice to be provided to the
applicant at least 10 days prior to the meeting and shall publish notice of
said hearing no later than five days prior to the date and time. The notice
shall reduce all alleged inconsistencies and violations to writing. The
Administrative Official, the applicant, and other interested persons shall be
allowed to present information and testimony to the Commission at the hearing.
If the Commission finds that an inconsistency or violation of the approved site
plan exists at the time of the hearing, then, by a majority vote of attending
members, the Commission may revoke the approval of the site plan and order the
site returned to its original condition by a date certain. Failure to comply
with such an order shall be deemed a violation of the use provisions of this
Ordinance and shall be subject to the penalties stated herein.
 
1180.17 MINOR MODIFICATIONS TO A SITE PLAN/ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   If a minor modification to a site plan is made, an applicant may have an
administrative review and not be required to go before the Commission to amend
the site plan. Variances, planned residential developments, planned unit
developments, or the expansion of a nonconforming use are not eligible for an
administrative review. Each action related to modification of a site plan shall
be duly recorded in writing on a copy of the approved plan, and shall be kept
on file in the office of the Administrative Official. The Administrative
Official shall have the authority to require a new site plan for the purposes
of clarity. The Commission shall be advised of all minor site plan
modifications approved by the Administrative Official, and such modifications

   (a)   Adequacy of Information and Compliance with Ordinance Requirements.
The site plan includes all required information in a complete and
understandable form that provides an accurate description of the proposed uses,
structures and site improvements. The site plan complies with all applicable
Ordinance requirements, including but not limited to minimum floor space,
height of building, lot size, yard space and density.
   (b)   Site Design Characteristics. All elements of the site design are
harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to topography, parcel
configuration, adjacent properties, traffic operations, adjacent streets and
driveways, pedestrian access, and the type and size of buildings. The site is
designed in a manner that promotes the normal and orderly development of
surrounding property for uses permitted by this Ordinance.
   (c)   Site Appearance and Coordination. Site elements are designed and
located so that the proposed development is aesthetically pleasing and
harmonious with adjacent existing or future developments. All site features,
including vehicle and pedestrian circulation, building orientation,
landscaping, lighting, utilities, recreation facilities, and open space are
harmonious and coordinated with adjacent properties.
   (d)   Preservation of Site Features. The site design preserves and conserves
natural, cultural, historical and architectural site features, including but
not limited to architecturally or historically significant buildings,
archeological sites, wetlands, topography, tree-rows and hedgerows, wooded
areas and significant individual trees.
   (e)   Pedestrian Access and Circulation. The arrangement of public or common
ways for pedestrian circulation connects to existing or planned sidewalks or
bicycle pathways in the area, and is insulated as completely as possible from
the vehicular circulation system. The site design complies with applicable
federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding barrier-free access.
   (f)   Vehicular Access and Circulation. Drives, streets, parking, site
access and other vehicle-related elements are designed to minimize traffic
conflicts on adjacent streets and promote safe and efficient traffic
circulation within the site.
   (g)   Building Design and Architecture.  Building design and architecture
relate to and are harmonious with the surrounding neighborhood with regard to
texture, scale, mass, proportion, materials and color.
   (h)   Parking and Loading. Off-street parking lots and loading zones are
arranged, located and designed to accommodate the intensity of proposed uses,
minimize conflicts with adjacent uses, enhance the character of the
neighborhood, and promote shared-use of common facilities by adjoining
properties.
   (i)   Landscaping and Screening.  Landscaping and screening are provided in
a manner that adequately buffers adjacent land uses and screens off-street
parking, mechanical appurtenances, loading and unloading areas and storage
areas from adjacent residential areas and public rights-of-way.
   (j)   Exterior Lighting.  All exterior lighting fixtures are designed,
arranged and shielded to minimize glare and light trespass, prevent night
blindness and vision impairments, and maximize security.
   (k)   Impact upon Public Services.  The impact upon public services will not
exceed the existing or planned capacity of such services, and adequate public
services (including but not limited to utilities (water, sanitary & storm
sewers, county drains, natural gas, electricity and telephone), streets, police
and fire protection, public schools and sidewalks/bicycle paths) are available
or provided to the site, and are designed with sufficient capacity and
durability to properly serve the development.
   (l)   Drainage and Soil Erosion. Drainage systems, stormwater facilities,
and soil erosion, sedimentation and dust control measures are arranged, located
and designed to promote shared-use of common facilities by adjoining
properties. Adjoining properties, public rights-of-way and the capacity of the
public storm drainage system will not be adversely affected by stormwater
runoff and sedimentation.
   (m)   Emergency Access and Vulnerability to Hazards. All sites and buildings
are designed to allow convenient and direct emergency access, and the level of
vulnerability to injury or loss from incidents involving hazardous materials or
processes will not exceed the City’s emergency response capabilities.
1180.20  DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property for which site
plan approval has been granted to develop, improve and maintain the site,
including the use, buildings and all site elements in accordance with the
approved site plan and all conditions of approval, until the property is razed
or a new site plan is approved. Failure to comply with the provisions of this
Section shall be a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same
penalties appropriate for a use violation. The Administrative Official shall
make periodic investigations of developments for which site plans have been
approved. Noncompliance with the requirements and conditions of the approved
site plan shall constitute grounds for the Commission to rescind site plan
approval.
1180.21 CONDITIONAL USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Intent. The procedures and standards in this Section are intended to
provide a consistent and uniform method for review of conditional use
proposals. Conditional uses are uses, either public or private, which possess
unique characteristics and therefore cannot be properly classified as permitted
uses in a particular zoning district. These review procedures and standards are
intended to accomplish the following purposes:
      (i)   Ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this
Ordinance and other applicable local ordinances, and state and federal laws.
      (ii)   Achieve efficient use of the land.
      (iii)   Prevent adverse impact on adjoining or nearby properties.
      (iv)   Protect natural resources.
      (v)   Facilitate development in accordance with the City’s land use
objectives.
   (b)   Procedures and Requirements. Conditional use applications shall be
submitted in accordance with the following procedures and requirements, which
provide for review and action by the Commission. Although a site plan must be
submitted with a conditional use application, approval of the conditional use
is required prior to site plan approval.
      (i)   Applicant Eligibility.  The application shall be submitted by the
owner of an interest in land for which conditional use approval is sought, or
by the owner’s designated agent. The applicant or a designated representative
should be present at all scheduled review meetings or consideration of the
proposal may be tabled.
      (ii)   Application Forms and Documentation.  The application for
conditional use shall be made on the forms and according to the guidelines in
this Ordinance, as provided by the Administrative Official.
      (iii)   Application Data Requirements. A site plan shall be submitted
with the conditional use application. In addition, the applicant shall complete
any forms and supply any other data that may be required by the Commission or
City staff to make the determination required, herein. The applicant shall
provide all necessary written or graphic materials to document compliance with
the standards set forth in this Ordinance, and other regulatory guidelines
specified for particular conditional uses elsewhere in this Ordinance.
      (iv)   Site Plan Preparation.  The site plan shall be prepared in the
manner specified in this Ordinance and on the conditional use application form.
A site plan which does not meet the stipulated requirements shall be considered
incomplete and shall therefore not be subject to formal review.
      (v)   Submission of a Completed Plan. The conditional use application
materials, required fees, and 12 copies of the completed site plan shall be
submitted to the Administrative Official for review.
      (vi)   Review by the City Officials. The Administrative Official and
other appropriate City officials shall review the site plan and application
materials, and prepare a written review, which shall specify any deficiencies
in the site plan and application and make recommendations as appropriate.
      (vii)   Submission of a Revised Plan and Conditional Use Application. The
applicant shall revise the site plan and application materials, based on the
recommendations set forth in the Administrative Official’s review. The
applicant shall then submit 12 copies of the revised plan for further review by
staff and the Commission.
      (viii)   Commission Consideration. After all application materials have
been received and review fees paid, the application shall be reviewed in
accordance with following procedures:
         (1)   Acceptance for Processing. The application shall be placed on
the agenda of the next available scheduled Commission meeting and a public
hearing shall be scheduled.
         (2)   Public Hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, and sent by mail or personal
delivery to the owners of property for which conditional use approval is being
considered, and to all owners of property adjacent to and directly across the
street from the property in question.
         (3)   Commission Review.  Following the public hearing, but not
necessarily at the same meeting, the conditional use proposal and plan shall be
reviewed by the Commission, based on the standards and regulations in this
Section.
         (4)   Plan Revision.  If the Commission determines that revisions are
necessary to bring the conditional use proposal into compliance with applicable
standards and regulations, the applicant shall be given the opportunity to
submit a revised application and site plan. Following submission of revised
application materials, the conditional use proposal shall be placed on the
agenda of the next available scheduled meeting of the Commission for further
review and possible action.
      (ix)   Commission Determination. The Commission shall review the
application for conditional use, together with the public hearing findings and
reports and recommendations from the Administrative Official, City Planner,
City Engineer, public safety officials, and other reviewing agencies. The
Commission shall then make a determination on the conditional use application,
based on the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The Commission may
approve, approve with conditions, or deny a conditional use request as follows:
         (1)   Approval.  Upon determination by the Commission that the final
plan for conditional use is in compliance with the standards and requirements
of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and laws, approval shall be
granted.
         (2)   Approval with Conditions. The Commission may impose reasonable
conditions with the approval of a conditional use proposal, to the extent
authorized by law. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:
            (a)   Conditions shall be designed to protect natural resources,
the health, safety, and welfare and the social and economic well- being of
those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and
landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the
community as a whole.
            (b)   Conditions shall be related to the valid exercise of the
police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
            (c)   Conditions shall be necessary to meet the intent and purpose
of this Ordinance, related to the standards established in this Ordinance for
the land use or activity under consideration, and necessary to insure
compliance with those standards.
         (3)   Denial.  Upon determination by the Commission that a conditional
use proposal does not comply with the standards and regulations set forth in
this Ordinance, or otherwise would be injurious to the public health, safety,
welfare, and orderly development of the City, the conditional use proposal
shall be denied.
      (x)   Recording of Commission Action. Each action taken with respect to a
conditional use shall be duly recorded in the minutes of the Commission. The
minutes shall record the findings of fact relative to each conditional use
proposal, the grounds for the action taken, and any conditions imposed in
conjunction with approval.
      (xi)   Effect of Approval. Upon approval, a conditional use shall be
deemed a conforming use permitted in the district in which it is proposed,
subject to any conditions imposed and final approval of the site plan. Such
approval shall affect only the lot or portion thereof on which the proposed use
is located.
      (xii)   Board Authority.  The Board shall not have the authority to
consider an appeal of a decision by the Commission concerning a conditional use
proposal.
      (xiii)   Application for a Building Permit. Prior to issuance of a
building permit, the applicant shall submit proof of the following:
         (1)   Final approval of the conditional use application.
         (2)   Final approval of the site plan.
         (3)   Final approval of the engineering plans.
         (4)   Acquisition of all other applicable City, county, or state
permits.
      (xiv)   Expiration of Conditional Use Approval. If construction has not
commenced within 24 months of final approval, the approval becomes null and
void and a new application for conditional use shall be required. Upon written
request from the applicant, a 12 month extension may be granted by the
Commission, if it finds that the approved conditional use application and site
plan adequately represent current conditions on and surrounding the site. The
written request for extension must be received prior to the site plan
expiration date or a new application for conditional use review will be
required.
      (xv)   Revocation of Conditional Use Approval.  Approval of a conditional
use proposal and site plan may be revoked by the Commission if construction is
not in conformance with the approved plans. In such a case, the Administrative
Official shall ask that the conditional use proposal be placed on the agenda of
the Commission. Written notice shall be provided to the applicant at least five
days prior to the meeting at which the case will be considered. The applicant
shall be given the opportunity to present information and to answer questions.
The Commission, as appropriate, may revoke approval if it finds that a
violation exists and has not been remedied prior to the hearing.
      (xvi)   Performance Guarantee.  The Commission may require that a
performance guarantee be deposited with the City to ensure faithful completion
of the improvements. Improvements that shall be covered by the performance
guarantee include, but are not necessarily limited to: landscaping, open space
improvements, streets, lighting, and sidewalks. The performance guarantee shall
comply with the requirements outlined in this Ordinance.
   (c)   Standards for Granting Conditional Use Approval. Approval of a
conditional use proposal shall be based on the determination that the proposed
use will comply with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including
site plan review criteria set forth for applicable site development standards
for specific uses set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, and the following
standards:
      (i)   Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The proposed conditional use
shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be compatible with
uses on surrounding land. The site design shall minimize the impact of site
activity on surrounding properties. In determining whether this requirement has
been met, consideration shall be given to:
         (1)   The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking
areas in relation to surrounding development.
         (2)   The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity
or work areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development.
         (3)   The hours of operation of the proposed use. Approval of a
conditional use may be conditioned upon operation within specified hours
considered appropriate to ensure minimal impact on surrounding uses.
         (4)   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the
proposed use in relation to surrounding uses.
      (ii)   Compatibility with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The proposed
conditional use shall be consistent with the general principles and objectives
of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
      (iii)   Compliance with Applicable Regulations. The proposed conditional
use shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws
and ordinances.
      (iv)   Use of Adjacent Property.  The proposed conditional use shall not
interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent property.
      (v)   Public Services.  The proposed conditional use shall not exceed the
capacity of existing and available public services, including but not
necessarily limited to utilities, public roads, police and fire protection
services, and educational services, unless the project proposal contains an
acceptable plan for providing necessary services or evidence that such services
will be available by the time the conditional use is completed.
      (vi)   Impact of Traffic.  The location of the proposed conditional use
shall, within the zoning district, minimize the impact of traffic generated by
the proposed use. In determining whether this requirement has been met,
consideration shall be given to the following:
         (1)   Proximity and access to major thoroughfares.
         (2)   Estimated traffic generated by the proposed use.
         (3)   Proximity and relation to intersections.
         (4)   Adequacy of driver sight distances.
         (5)   Location of and access to off-street parking.
         (6)   Required vehicular turning movements.
         (7)   Provision of pedestrian traffic.
      (vii)   Enhancement of Surrounding Environment. The proposed conditional
use shall provide the maximum feasible enhancement of the surrounding
environment, and shall not unreasonably interfere with or discourage the
appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably
affect their value. In determining whether this requirement has been met,
consideration shall be given to:
         (1)   The provision of landscaping and other site amenities. Provision
of additional landscaping over and above the specific requirements of this
Ordinance may be required as a condition of approval of a conditional use.
         (2)   The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of proposed
structures in relation to surrounding uses.
      (viii)   Impact on Public Health, Safety, and Welfare. The proposed
conditional use shall not involve any activities, processes, materials,
equipment, or conditions of operation, and shall not be located or designed in
a manner that is detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare. In
determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given
to the production of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes, odors, dust,
glare, and light.
      (ix)   Isolation of Existing Uses. The location of the proposed
conditional use shall not result in a small residential area being
substantially surrounded by non-residential development, and further, the
location of the proposed conditional use shall not result in a small non-
residential area being substantially surrounded by incompatible uses.
      (x)   Need for the Proposed Use. The Commission shall find that a need
for the proposed use exists in the community at the time the proposal is
considered.
1180.22 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   (a)   Intent.  The purpose of this Section is to provide guidelines and
standards to be followed by the Board, or the Commission where applicable, in
considering requests for variances and appeals, where the jurisdiction of the
Board, or the Commission where applicable, has been established by these
regulations or by the Revised Code.
   (b)   Purpose of Variances and Appeals.
      (i)   Appeals. Generally, an appeal may be taken to the Board by a
person, or by any office, department, board, or bureau aggrieved by a decision
of any administrative or enforcement official or body charged with enforcement
of this Ordinance. An appeal must be filed within 14 days of issuance of the
applicable written decision, and such appeal shall be made on forms made
available by the Administrative Official.
      (ii)   Variances. Where there are “practical difficulties” (for area
variances), “unnecessary hardships” (for use variances), “particular hardships”
(for sign variances) or “unusual or exceptional factors” (for subdivision
variances) preventing a property owner from conforming with the strict letter
of this Ordinance, the Board, or the Commission where applicable, shall have
the power to authorize variances from the standards in this Ordinance, with
such conditions and safeguards as it may determine to be necessary so that the
spirit of this Ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and substantial
justice done.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal to the Board, or the Commission where
applicable, shall stay enforcement proceedings in furtherance of the appealed
action, unless the Administrative Official certifies to the Board, or the
Commission where applicable, that by reason of the facts stated in the appeal,
a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an injunction granted by the
Court of Common Pleas. A stay of proceedings shall not stay the City’s
authority to issue a stop work order on a project that may be in progress and
being performed in a manner that is not in conformance with applicable
ordinances and regulations. Also, it shall not stay a project when the appeal
is brought by a third-party contesting the issuance of a permit.
   (d)   Application to the Board, or the Commission where applicable.
Variances and appeals for which Board, or Commission where applicable, action
is sought shall be commenced by a person filing an application to the Board, or
the Commission where applicable, on forms as specified by the Administrative
Official and accompanied by required fees. The application shall specify the
grounds upon which the appeal is based and shall contain a notarized signature
of the property owner or owner’s agent. Applications involving a request for a
variance shall specify the section number(s) containing the standards from
which a variance is sought and the nature and extent of such variance.
   (e)   Plot Plan Requirements. Applications involving a specific site shall
be accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale that includes the following
information, where applicable:
      (i)   Applicant’s name, address, and telephone number.
      (ii)   Property tax identification number, scale, northpoint, and dates
of submission and revisions.
      (iii)   Zoning classification of petitioner’s parcel and all abutting
parcels.
      (iv)   Existing lot lines, building lines, structures, parking areas,
driveways, and other improvements on the site and within 50 feet of the site.
      (v)   For variances requested from any dimensional standard of this
Ordinance, the plot plan shall include verified measurements of existing
conditions and the proposed dimensions or calculations regarding the specific
standards from which the variance is sought.
      (vi)   Any additional information required by the Administrative Official
or the Board to make the determination requested herein.
   Where an application to the Board involves a variance sought in conjunction
with a site plan review by the Commission, the application data requirements
for site plan review as set forth in this Ordinance shall be followed.
   (f)   Review by the Board. The Administrative Official shall forward the
application, along with any supporting materials and plans to the Board. The
Administrative Official or the Board, or the Commission where applicable, shall
fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or variance. Notice of the
public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City, and sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for which
conditional use approval is being considered, and to all owners of property
adjacent to and directly across the street from the property in question. At
the hearing, a party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (g)   Decision by the Board, or the Commission where applicable. The
concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse an
order, requirement, decision, or determination of the administrative official
or body, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which they are
required to pass under, or to effect any variation in an ordinance adopted
pursuant to the Revised Code. The concurring vote of a majority of those
Commission members present at any meeting shall be necessary to effect any
variation in an ordinance adopted pursuant to the Revised Code. The Board, or
the Commission where applicable, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, in accordance
with the guidelines set forth herein. To that end, the Board, or the Commission
where applicable, shall have all the powers of the officer or body from whom
the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. With an
affirmative decision, the Board, or the Commission where applicable, may impose
conditions. The decision of the Board, or the Commission where applicable,
shall be final, but the City with approval by the Council or any person having
an interest affected by a decision of the Board, or the Commission where
applicable, may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, and to any Court of final
jurisdiction.
   (h)   Record of Decision and Order. The Board, or the Commission where
applicable, shall prepare and retain a record of each appeal, and shall base
its decision on this record. This record shall include:
      (i)   The relevant administrative records and the administrative orders
issued thereon relating to the appeal.
      (ii)   The notice of the appeal.
      (iii)   Such documents, exhibits, plans, photographs, or written reports
as may be submitted to the Board for its consideration.
   The written findings of fact, the decisions, and the conditions imposed by
the Board, or the Commission where applicable, in acting on the appeal shall be
entered into the official record, after being signed by the Secretary of the
Board, or the Commission where applicable.
   (i)   Approval Period. If construction has not commenced within 24 months
after the Board grants a variance to permit the erection or alteration of a
building, then the variance becomes null and void. If construction has not
commenced within 24 months after the Commission grants a variance to permit the
construction of a subdivision, then the variance becomes null and void. The
period of approval may be automatically extended by 12 months if the variance
was sought in conjunction with a site plan or subdivision for which approval
has been extended by the Commission.
(Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
   (j)   Standards for Variances and Appeals. Variances and appeals shall be
granted only in accordance with and based on the findings set forth in this
Section. The burden of proof for variances and appeals shall be upon the
applicant. The extent to which the following factors, standards, and criteria
apply to a specific case shall be determined by the Board, or the Commission
where applicable.
      (i)   Factors Applicable to Area Variances (“practical difficulties”).
The applicant shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that the variance
is justified, as determined by the Board, or the Commission where applicable.
The Board, or the Commission where applicable, shall weigh the following
factors to determine whether an area variance should be granted:
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
         (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         (2)   Whether the variance is insubstantial;
         (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
         (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance; and/or
         (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance.
      (ii)   Standards Applicable to Use Variances (“unnecessary hardships”).
The applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that all of
the following standards have been met in order to justify the granting of a use
variance, as determined by the Board:
         (1)   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         (2)   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
         (3)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
rights of adjacent owners;
         (4)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
public health, safety or general welfare;
         (5)   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of this Ordinance;
         (6)   The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief to
the applicant; and
         (7)   There is no other economically viable use which is permitted in
the zoning district.
      (iii)   Criteria Applicable to Sign Variances (“particular hardships”).
The applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that all of
the following standards have been met in order to justify the granting of a
sign variance, as determined by the Board:
         (1)   The granting of the requested variance would not be detrimental
to the property owners in the vicinity;
         (2)   Hardship caused the sign user under a literal interpretation of
this Ordinance is due to conditions unique to the property and does not apply
generally to the City. The hardship cannot be created by prior actions or
inactions of the applicant;
         (3)   The granting of the variance would not be contrary to the
general objectives of this Ordinance; and
         (4)   The granting of the variance shall be for the minimum required
to offset the hardship.
            (Ord. 35-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
      (iv)   Criteria Applicable to Subdivision Variances (“unusual or
exceptional factors”). The applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that all of the following standards have been met in order to justify
the granting of a subdivision variance (from Chapter
1136,
1164,
1166 or
1168), as determined by the Commission:
         (Ord. 45-09. Passed 9-8-09.)
         (1)   Unusual topographical or exceptional physical conditions exist;
         (2)   Strict compliance with the requirement should create an extra
hardship in the face of the exceptional conditions;
         (3)   The variance sought is the minimum which will remove the
extraordinary hardship; and
         (4)   The variance will not be detrimental to the public interest or
in conflict with the intent and purposes of this Ordinance.
      (v)   Criteria Applicable to Appeals. The Board shall reverse an order of
a zoning official only if it finds that the action or decision appealed:
         (1)   Was arbitrary or capricious; or
         (2)   Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact; or
         (3)   Was based on erroneous interpretation of this Ordinance or
zoning law; or
         (4)   Constituted an abuse of discretion.
1180.23 AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Initiation of Amendment. The Council may from time to time, at its own
initiative or upon recommendation from the Commission or on petition, amend,

principal use.
   (k)   Period of Validity.  A final certificate of occupancy shall remain in
effect for the life of the building or structure, or part thereof, as long as
the specific operation conducted within the building or structure or use of the

Commission pursuant to this Ordinance.
   (n)   Issuance of Certificate.  The Administrative Official shall inspect a
building or structure within 15 working days after notification by an applicant
of the completion of a building or structure or other improvements. The

1330.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Alliance, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Alliance has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Alliance as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Alliance.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 29, 2011. (Replacing former Flood Insurance Study City of
Alliance, Ohio Stark and Mahoning County effective January 5, 1982.)
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map City of Alliance, Ohio Stark and Mahoning
County effective July 5, 1982.
      (3)   Flood Hazard and Floodway Map City of Alliance, Ohio Stark and
Mahoning County effective July 5, 1982.
      (4)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (5)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Alliance as required by Section
1330.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Engineering, Building, and Zoning Office at 504
East Main Street Alliance, Ohio 44601.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses pennitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Alliance, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 74-11.
Passed 9-6-11.)

   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation. or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:

Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Alliance's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR.F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701.27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Alliance Flood
Insurance Rate Map, July 5, 1982, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (27)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the fust
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 74-11. Passed 9-6-11.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Alliance flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1330.01(f), accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1330.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1330.03(j)(1), prepared in a fonnat required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1330.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Alliance, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Alliance have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Alliance Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Alliance
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Alliance suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Alliance has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1330.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary shows that an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1330.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Alliance and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1330.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An lllustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Alliance specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1330.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 74-11. Passed 9-6-11.)
1330.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Alliance Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to serve
as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Alliance Code
Section
1170.04.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and tiled in
City Engineering, Building and Zoning Office at 504 East Main Street Alliance,
Ohio 44601.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Alliance.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Administrative Official shall
forward the application, along with any supporting materials and plans to the
Board. The Administrative Official or the Board, or the Commission where
applicable, shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or
variance. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City at least five (5) days before the date of the
hearing, and sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for
which conditional use approval is being considered, and to all owners of
property adjacent to and directly across the street from the property in
question. At the hearing, a party may appear in person or by agent or by
attorney.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make fmdings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including alJ documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the appropriate County Court of Common Please
(Stark and/or Mahoning), as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 74-11. Passed 9-6-11.)

1365.01 ADOPTION.
      There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, as amended to date, and as identified and
published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
(Ord. 71-21. Passed 10-4-21.)
1365.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1365.03 SCOPE.

the Ohio Mechanical Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code shall apply to the
construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair,
equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of
every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such

(ORC 3737.61)
1501.07 SETTING FIRES WHICH SPREAD.

(ORC 3737.62)
1501.08 UNFRIENDLY FIRES IN BUILDINGS AND DUTY TO WARN; REQUIREMENTS FOR
RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES; TESTING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   The owner, operators or lessee, an employee of any owner, operator or

under the Ohio Basic Building Code, upon discovery of an unfriendly fire, or
upon receiving information that there is an unfriendly fire on the premises,
shall immediately, and with all reasonable dispatch and diligence, call or
otherwise notify the Fire Department concerning the fire, and shall spread an
alarm immediately to all occupants of the building.
   For the purposes of this section, "unfriendly fire" means fire of a
destructive nature as distinguished from a controlled fire intended for a
beneficial and approved purpose.
   (b)   The owner of any residential structure for which no early fire warning
requirements have been imposed by any other applicable municipal ordinance,
state or federal law shall install an operable early fire warning system and be
responsible for assuring that an operable early fire warning system is
continuously present on the premises. Detectors shall be located in the
immediate vicinity but outside of all sleeping areas. Alarm signaling devices
of the detector(s) shall be clearly audible in all sleeping areas when all
intervening doors are closed. In residential structures having a basement or
cellar, an additional detector shall be installed and maintained in the
basement or cellar in accordance with NFPA standard #74-1989 "Standard
Installation, Maintenance and Use of Household Fire Warning Equipment." Crawl
spaces and uninhabitable attics are excluded. In residential structures with
split levels, detector(s) need to be installed only on the upper level,
provided the lower level is less than one full story below the upper level,
except if there is a door between levels, then a detector(s) is required on
each level. Any residential structure occupied by a person who is deaf or
hearing impaired shall have a early fire warning system installed by the owner
which provides a visual or vibrative signal sufficient to warn the deaf or
hearing impaired individual when activated.
   (c)   “Fire warning system” shall mean an approved automatic warning system
of one or more devices that detects any of the products of combustion,
including visible or invisible particles of combustion, and that produces an

thereof of the presence of fire. The primary power for such system may be
either an AC electrical system or a monitored battery unless specified by other
municipal ordinance, state or federal law in accordance with NFPA standard #74
titled "Standard Installation, Maintenance and Use of Household Fire Warning
Equipment", 72E titled "Standard Automatic Fire Detectors" and #72 titled
"Standard Installation, Maintenance and Use of Protective Signaling Systems."
   For the purpose of this section, an approved system shall be one which is
listed by the Underwriter's Laboratories, Inc. and conforms to the applicable
sections of NFPA standard #74-1989 titled "Standard Installation, Maintenance
and Use of Household Fire Warning Equipment", 72E titled "Standard Automatic
Fire Detectors" and #72 titled "Standard Installation, Maintenance and Use of
Protective Signaling Systems." No early fire warning system shall be directly
connected (hardwired) to the electrical system of the structure unless it has
been individually approved and an electrical permit has first been individually
approved and an electrical permit has first been obtained from the Building
Inspection Department of the City of Alliance.
   (d)   Testing and inspection of early fire warning systems in any
residential structure shall be performed by the occupant not less than once a
month. The owner shall provide the occupant with printed information as to the
proper testing of the system. At every change of occupancy due to sale, rent,
lease or sublease, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to inspect the
early fire warning system to insure proper operational condition. The occupant
shall notify the owner in writing that a early fire warning system is in need
of replacement or repair. The owner shall replace the system within seventy-two
(72) hours of receipt of the written notice. The owner shall provide new
batteries for battery operated early fire warning systems at least annually and
at the beginning of any subsequent sale, rent, lease or sublease. It shall be
the responsibility of the occupant to ensure that the batteries installed are
not removed from the system. Anyone tampering or interfering with the
effectiveness of a early fire warning system shall be in violation of this
chapter and subject to the penalties set forth in Section
1501.99.
   (e)   The Building Inspector and Fire Inspector shall have concurrent
jurisdiction with the Chief of the Fire Department to inspect any early fire
warning system required by this section. If, upon inspection, a violation of
this section is found, the fire inspector shall issue written notice of such
violation to the owner requiring the owner to conform to this section within
fifteen (15) calendar days of issuance of such notice. No owner or occupant
shall refuse to allow inspection at reasonable times of any structure or unit
by a duly authorized City inspector. After investigating a fire in any
residential structure, in the absence of an early fire warning system, the Fire
Department investigating authority shall issue to the owner an early fire
warning system installation order. Failure to comply with such order within
fifteen (15) days of reoccupancy of the premises constitutes a violation of
this chapter.
   (f)   Anyone who violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to the penalties set forth in Section
1501.99. Each day of a continuing violation shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (g)   This section shall take effect and be in force from and after the
earliest period allowed by law.

individual detector(s).
      (2)   “Owner” means and includes the record owner of the premises as
evidenced by the deed records of the Stark County Recorder and also purchaser
