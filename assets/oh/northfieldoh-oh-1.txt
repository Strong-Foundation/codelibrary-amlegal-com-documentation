property, shall be passed unless it has been read in full on three (3)
different days, unless the requirement for such reading be dispensed with by

which event the ordinance or resolution shall be fully and distinctly read, by
title only, at least once before passage.
      (2)   The procedure for making public improvements and levying
assessments, including the procedure for combining two or more public

   (c)   Unless Council by rule or regulation expresses a contrary intention,
its conduct of meetings and the form and method of enactment of legislation

effect, unless a later time be specified therein, upon its signature by the
Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be disapproved by
the Mayor, or upon its passage after its disapproval by the Mayor, as the case
may be. All other ordinances and resolutions shall take effect and be operative
in the manner provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio. Each emergency
measure shall contain a statement of the necessity for such emergency action
and shall require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of those members elected
to Council for its enactment. No ordinance or resolution: (a) relating to any
changes in the boundaries of the Village, (b) providing for the surrender or
joint exercise of any of Village powers,(c) granting any franchise or (d)
contracting for the supply to the Municipality or its inhabitants of the

term. The compensation of every other employee, and member of any board or
commission, of this Municipality, shall be as fixed by Council.
   The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Superintendent of the Service
Department, and such other officials or employees, or members of boards or

   (EDITOR'S NOTE: This section was edited as part of the 1997 updating of this
City Charter to change references to the Clerk-Treasurer to the Finance
Director.)
SECTION 4.13   VACANCIES.
   Any vacancy on the Council or an office thereof shall be filled by a two-
thirds vote of all remaining members of Council. If the vacancy is in the
office of a Councilperson representing a ward such vacancy must be filled from

vacancy can be filled from any ward within the Municipality. In the event
Council should fail to fill a vacancy in the office of a Councilperson within
thirty (30) days from the date such vacancy occurs, then the power of Council
to do so shall lapse and the Mayor shall fill it by appointment. The person
elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall have the qualifications for the
particular office specified in Section

   Where organization, powers and duties of departments, boards and commissions
are not expressly provided herein, they shall be as provided by resolution or
ordinance of Council.
SECTION 4.15   CENSURE.
   Members of Council may formally censure a colleague, the Mayor or the Law
Director for the occurrence of any of the following while in office: conviction
of a misdemeanor under the Ohio Revised Code, misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance in office, abuse of authority or position, action contrary to a
passed legislative decree of Council, the Summit County Council or the Ohio
General Assembly, conduct unbecoming an elected official or being absent for
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the regularly scheduled meetings of
Council in a twelve (12)-month period without just cause.
   A censure motion must be brought during a regularly scheduled meeting of
Council. The motion shall contain the specified allegations against the accused
member. At that time, the President Pro-tem of Council, or the most senior
member of Council should the President Pro-tem be the subject of the censure
motion, shall schedule, within fifteen (15) days, a special meeting of Council,
open to the public, to hear testimony supporting the motion. The accused
official shall have the opportunity to cross examine all witnesses and present
a defense. Council may then recess to executive session to consider the facts.
However, a vote to censure must take place in open Council, either at a
regularly scheduled meeting or during the special meeting called to hear the
facts. A censure motion shall pass by a minimum of four (4) votes of non-
accused members of Council. Abstentions shall be considered a "no" vote.
   A censure must include a public reprimand of the offending official, to be
delivered by the Law Director or the President Pro-tem of Council during the
next regularly scheduled meeting of Council after the passage of the censure
motion. In addition, a censured official may be subject to any or all of the
following: loss of pay for up to four (4) months, loss of committee
chairmanship, loss of committee membership and/or loss of seniority. Each
sanction must pass by four (4) votes of non-censured members of Council. A

SECTION 4.16   FORFEITURE OF OFFICE.
   The Mayor or any member of Council shall forfeit their office upon
conviction of any felony, or conviction of any offense stemming from any other
jurisdiction in the United States that would be a felony pursuant to the Ohio

find the petition insufficient, he or she shall promptly certify the
particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of his or her

of such delivery, at the same time as any other general or special election
held within such period, but if no such election is to be held within such
period, the Council shall call a special recall election to be held within the
time aforesaid. Such special recall election shall be submitted to the electors
of the entire Municipality if such officer to be recalled was elected by the
electors of the entire Municipality, and such special recall election shall be
submitted to the electors of a single ward if the officer to be recalled was
elected by the electors of a single ward. At such recall election this question
shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (Naming the Officer) be removed from
office as (naming the office) of the Village/City of Northfield?" with
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such
question. If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be voted

cast shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall be considered as removed,
his or her office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as

(ORC 1.45)
202.04   REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy with respect to any

provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed

(ORC 1.58)
202.05   CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.

202.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS; CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (d)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council, may consider, among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

project determined by Council to be an emergency requiring immediate action,
including, but not limited to, any projects requiring multiple contracts let as
a part of a program requiring a large number of professional design firms of
the same type.
   VILLAGE OF NORTHFIELD POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR PROCUREMENT OF PROFESSIONAL
DESIGN SERVICES
A.   PREQUALIFICATION PROCEDURE:
   The Village of Northfield, Ohio, through its Mayor, will request
qualification statements from any interested professional architects, engineers
and surveyors to provide professional design or construction management
services. The request will be published in newspapers of general circulation as
chosen by the Mayor and requests will be sent directly to firms that are known
to have a direct interest in providing such services.
   “Qualifications” means all of the following:
   1.   Competence of the professional designer or firm to perform the required
professional design services as indicated by the technical training, education
and experience of the firm's personnel, especially the technical training,
education and experience of the employees within the firm who would be assigned
to perform the services;
   2.   Ability of the firm in terms of its work load and the availability of
qualified personnel, equipment and facilities to perform the required
professional design services competently and expeditiously;
   3.   Past performance of the firm as reflected by the evaluations of the
previous clients with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of
work and meeting of deadlines;
   4.   Past performance and current performance on previous Village of
Northfield contracts; and
   5.   Any other similar factors deemed relevant by the Village of Northfield.
   The qualification statements submitted by the professionals should contain
information based upon the format set forth in Appendix A - “Qualifications-
Based Selection Statement Criteria,” which is set forth below. A firm that
submits a statement that does not include all of the requested information will
be deemed to be unqualified. The Village of Northfield may also ask any
professional to supplement its statement if deemed necessary.
   Qualification statements will be accepted at any time from any firm, as
other firms become aware of this policy.
   Professional design firms deemed prequalified by the Village of Northfield
must submit an update of the statement annually in order to remain qualified.
B.   PRE-DESIGN PHASE AND ANNOUNCEMENT:
   The Village of Northfield, through its Mayor, will conduct a pre-design
phase for all contracts available for professional design services for specific
projects in order to determine the project scope of services and requirements,
the project schedule, the conceptional schematic design, the project budget,
and, if appropriate, soil boring and testing and other analysis. The Village
Engineer and any other designee of the Mayor may be involved in the pre-design
phase.
   Upon completion of the pre-design phase, the project shall be announced as
follows:
   1.   The announcement of the project requirements and scope of services
shall be made in a uniform and consistent manner in advance of the time that
the proposals are received.
   2.   The announcement shall include a description of the project, a
statement of the specific professional design service required, and a
description of the qualifications required for the project, and shall generally
follow the format set forth in Appendix B - “Public Announcement,” which is set
forth below.
   3.   The announcement shall indicate how qualified professional design firms
may submit a proposal or statement of qualifications in order to be considered
for a contract to design the project.
   4.   The announcement shall be sent to either of the following:
      a.   Each professional design firm that has a current statement of
qualifications on file and is qualified to perform the required, professional
design services;
      b.   Architect, landscape architect, engineer and surveyor trade
associations, the news media and any publications or other public media that
the Mayor of the Village of Northfield considers appropriate.
C.   SELECTION PROCESS:
   For every professional design services contract, the statements of
qualifications for professional design firms shall be reviewed and evaluated
upon submission.
   A committee convened and chaired by the Mayor shall review and evaluate the
statement of qualifications using a pre-established project criteria, and,
generally, following the evaluation form which is attached as Appendix C.
   The committee shall issue a list of no fewer than three (3) firms rated
qualified to perform the required services for the specific project. If fewer
than three qualified firms are available, those firms shall be selected.
   Upon selection, the Mayor shall send a request for letters of interest to
the firms that have been selected. Any interested firm shall supply all of the
requested information concerning the project by the date specified in the
announcement or written request.
   A scope clarification meeting may be conducted with the firms that are
selected and that have declared an interest in the project. The discussions
shall be designed to further explore the scope and nature of the services
required, the various technical approaches the firms may take toward the
project, unique project requirements, the project schedule, the conceptual
schematic design, and the project budget. Depending upon the unique nature of
the project, the meeting may include a physical site visit. Any questions must
be resolved at this meeting and shared with all participants, precluding any
further contact with the committee.
   The firm selected may be asked to supplement its statement of qualifications
with a technical proposal in accordance with the final scope of services and
project requirements as may have been clarified at the scope clarification
meeting. Each professional design firm requested to submit a technical proposal
shall be informed of the date, time and location for such submittals.
   The committee shall evaluate, select and rank all of the firms that were
selected and that expressed interest in the project. The ranking shall set
forth in order the firms most qualified to provide the required professional
design services based upon their qualifications, technical proposals, if any,
and the specific project.
   If one firm is determined to be most qualified, the firm shall be asked to
submit a lump sum fee proposal. If more than one firm is determined to be
equally most qualified, then each firm shall be asked to submit a lump sum fee
proposal. The firms may submit a revised technical proposal. The firm
submitting the lowest fee proposal shall be determined to be the most
qualified.
   The Mayor and/or individuals designated by him or her shall negotiate a
contract with the firm ranked most qualified to perform the required services
at a compensation determined to be fair and reasonable to the Village of
Northfield. The contract negotiations shall be directed toward:
   1.   Insuring that the professional design firm and the Village of
Northfield have a mutual understanding of the essential requirements involved
in providing the required services, including meeting the established total
project budget;
   2.   Determining that the firm will make available the necessary personnel,
equipment and facilities to perform the services within the required time;
   3.   Agreeing upon compensation which is fair and reasonable, taking into
account the estimated value, scope, complexity and nature of the services.
   Upon the failure to negotiate a contract agreeable to the Village of
Northfield with the most qualified firm, negotiations shall commence with the
second ranked firm, and so on until an agreeable contract has been reached.
   The final contract with the professional design firm is conditioned upon
approval being granted by Village Council.

(Ord. 1989-14. Passed 1-11-89.)
   (b)   Rules of Council. Rules of Council shall be as follows:
      (1)   Copies of legislation to be proposed for passage under suspension
of the three- reading rule, or as an emergency, shall be in Councilmembers'
boxes by 5:00 p.m. on the day prior to the meeting.
(Ord. 1970-80. Passed 10-28-70.)
      (2)   An agenda for the meeting, including proposed legislation, shall be
prepared by the Clerk of Council and delivered to the Director of Law no later
than 5:00 p.m. of the third business day prior to the meeting.
(Ord. 1989-14. Passed 1-11-89.)
      (3)   Discussion from the audience will be in order during consideration
of legislation proposed for passage under suspension of the three-reading rule
or as an emergency. The Chairman shall have the right to limit such discussion.
      (4)   Discussion from the audience under subsection (a)(4) of the Order
of Business shall be limited to five minutes for each person addressing the
meeting, unless additional time has been requested of and approved by the
Chairman prior to the meeting. Rulings of the Chairman on such prior requests
for additional time are subject to appeal to Council. After a reasonable time
has been provided for such discussion, the Chairman may establish an overall
time limit or may suspend further discussion to allow Council to proceed to
subsequent items of business.
      (5)   The Mayor shall appoint a parliamentarian, subject to approval of
two-thirds of all members elected or appointed to Council.
      (6)   Any deviation from any of these Rules of Procedure will require a
three-fourths vote of all members elected or appointed to Council for
suspension of these rules.
   (c)   Conduct of Meetings. Conduct of all meetings shall be in accordance
with the following rules of order:
      (1)   Before any subject is open to discussion, it is necessary that:
         A.   First, a motion be made by a member, who has obtained the floor;
         B.   Second, that the motion be seconded by another member;
         C.   Third, that the motion be stated by the Chairperson, as recorded
by the Clerk.
      Before the question is stated by the Chair, any member can obtain the
floor for informal consultation or to suggest modification of the wording. The
Chairperson should see that this does not run into actual discussion of the
question. The mover may accept such modification or may withdraw the motion
without consent of the second. But once the motion has been stated by the
Chair, wording can be modified only by a motion to amend. Introduction of any
ordinance for first reading shall open such ordinance to discussion, even
though no formal motion accompanies it. Such ordinance shall be subject to
amendment and/or referral to committee, and other general rules of discussion
shall apply as otherwise provided in these rules. If, after a reasonable length
of time for discussion on such ordinance, no motions relating to it are
offered, the Chairperson may suspend such discussion to second or third reading
at a subsequent meeting, and move to the next item of business.
         When it is known that a specific subject must be acted upon, the
Chairperson may permit discussion on the subject prior to any formal motion.
Such discussion shall be subject to other general rules as herein provided. At
any time during such discussion, the Chairperson, or any member of Council, may
ask for a motion. Once such a request is made, there can be no further
discussion until a motion has been properly made, seconded and stated.
      (2)   Before any member can offer a motion, or make any remarks in debate
or discussion, he or she must first obtain the floor by requesting “Mr. or Ms.
Chairperson”. The Chair will then recognize the member by name. If more than
one member seeks recognition at the same time, priority shall be as follows:
         A.   If a motion is on the floor, the member who made the motion has
preference if he or she has not already spoken on the question, except that if
the motion is to accept a committee report or recommendation, the member who
made the report or recommendation has preference, regardless of who made the
motion. On any other motion, including a motion to adopt an ordinance or
resolution, the mover for adoption has preference if he or she has not
previously spoken on the question.
         B.   A member who has not spoken on the question under discussion has
preference over one who has already spoken on the question.
         C.   As much as possible, the floor should alternate between
supporters and opponents of a proposal. The Chairperson, when he or she knows
which side of a question is taken by claimants to the floor, and when neither
paragraph (c)(2)A. or B. hereof applies, should give preference to the member
opposed to the last speaker.
         D.   If no motion is on the floor, or if none of the above conditions
applies, then the judgment of the Chairperson on who first requested the floor
shall prevail.
      (3)   A motion is a proposal that Council take certain action, or express
itself as holding certain views. A motion is made by a member obtaining the
floor and saying “I move that. . . “ and stating the action he or she proposes
to have taken. Examples: “I move that Ordinance No. 1970-46 be adopted”; “I
move that Resolution No. 1970-35 be adopted”; (If such a motion is already on
the floor) “I move that Ordinance No. 1970-28 be amended by deleting the words:
Or his designated representative”; or “I move that Ordinance No. 1970-52 be
referred to the Playground Committee”. A motion which is long or involved
should be written out, preferably in the form of a resolution.
      (4)   Every motion should be seconded. This prevents time being consumed
considering a question that only one person favors. When members are slow in
seconding a motion, the Chair should ask “Is there a second?”
      (5)   When a motion has been made and seconded, the Chairperson, unless
he or she rules it out of order, should state the question. At this point, the
Clerk of Council should be allowed sufficient time to record the mover, the
seconder and the exact wording of the motion with any modifications agreed upon
as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) hereof. Example: “It is moved and seconded that
Ordinance No. 1970-55 be adopted”; “It is moved and seconded that Council
approve the use of the Town Hall lawn for the Ladies Aid Social June 30th”.
Only after the question is recorded by the Clerk and stated by the Chairperson
is a question open for discussion. Once it has been so stated, it belongs to
Council; it can be withdrawn only if there is no objection or if a majority
vote permits; it can be changed only by a motion to amend.
      (6)   Discussion must be limited to the immediately pending question, as
stated by the Chairperson. Members should confine their remarks to the points
of question and avoid personalities. Speakers should address their remarks to
the Chairperson at all times. When the discussion appears to the Chairperson to
be finished, he or she should ask “Are you ready for the question?” If, after a
reasonable pause, no one asks for the floor, the Chairperson assumes that no
member wishes to speak further, and shall instruct the Clerk of Council to call
the roll for a vote.
      (7)   Secondary motions are those which may be offered while a motion is
already on the floor.
         A.   A motion to amend a pending motion may be offered during
discussion on the motion. Amendment can be proposed by deleting words from the
main motion, by adding or inserting words to the main motion or by substituting
different words for what is in the main motion. A motion to amend must be
discussed and voted upon before discussion returns to the main motion, or
before another amendment is considered. A motion to amend a pending amendment
is not in order; a member may state what he or she will propose if the pending
amendment is voted down. An amendment is not in order if:
            1.   It is not directly related to the question to be amended;
            2.   It reverses the meaning of the original question;
            3.   It strikes out or inserts words which would leave no rational
proposition before Council;
            4.   It is frivolous or absurd; or
            5.   It introduces an independent new question.
         B.   A motion to refer a question to committee may be offered during
discussion on a main motion or its amendments. Referral to committee includes
the main motion and any pending amendments. If the motion to refer to committee
is adopted, there can be no further discussion or action on the question,
pending report of the committee at a future meeting.
         C.   A motion to call for a vote may be offered during discussion on a
main motion, its amendments or a motion to refer a question to a committee. The
purpose of this motion is to cut off discussion and get an immediate vote. It
requires a two-thirds vote of the full Council (four members) to be adopted,
thus ending discussion of a question.
               A motion to call for a vote is not debatable. Once it has been
moved, seconded and stated by the Chair, it must be voted on immediately,
unless a motion to table is offered as explained further in paragraph (c)(7)D.
below. A motion to call for a vote can be offered in two forms:
            1.   Unqualified. “I move to vote on the question”. This applies
only to the immediately pending question, main motion, amendment or referral to
committee.
            2.   Qualified. To include any or all of a pending series of
motions: “I move to vote on the question of referral to committee and on the
amendment, etc. “ This can also include the main motion. If passed, the vote
must proceed without further discussion on each of the pending motions
specified.
               If a call for a vote fails to get a two-thirds vote, discussion
continues as if the motion had not been made.
         D.   A motion to table may be offered during discussion on a motion,
on amendments or on referrals to committee. Also, if a call for a vote has been
moved, before such a call is voted upon, a motion to table may be offered,
postponing further discussion without forcing an immediate decision. A motion
to table may also be offered following approval of a call for a vote, prior to
the final vote on any series of motions covered by the call for a vote. A
motion to table includes the main motion and any pending amendments. A motion
to table is not debatable. Once it has been made and seconded, the question
must be stated and a vote taken immediately. A motion to table may be offered
in two forms:
            1.   To table to a specified future meeting. If a matter is so
tabled to a specified future meeting, consideration automatically resumes as
first priority under Unfinished Business.
            2.   To table indefinitely. If a matter is tabled indefinitely, a
separate motion is required to continue discussion or to take a vote. This
cannot be done later in the same meeting, but must be at a future meeting.
            If a call for a vote has been moved or adopted on a matter which is
then tabled before a final vote is taken, the call for a vote will no longer
apply if the matter comes up at a future meeting. In such a case, the matter
will then be open for discussion.
         E.   A motion to adjourn is in order at any time, except:
            1.   When repeated without intervening business or discussion;
            2.   When made while another member is speaking;
            3.   When a call for a vote has been moved or adopted;
            4.   While a vote is being taken.
         The Chairperson cannot summarily adjourn the meeting. Regular
adjournment must be authorized by a motion of Council. In the case of regular
adjournment, the meeting is ended and no further action can be taken.
         Sometimes it is not possible for Council to complete all its business
within the available time at a given meeting. In such a case, it is proper to
move to adjourn to a definite time. When Council reconvenes at the appointed
time, it takes up the business where it left off at its former meeting,
provided a quorum is present. An adjourned meeting is merely a continuation of
the meeting which was adjourned.
      (8)   A member may raise a point of order whenever he or she has a
question or objection regarding the application of any of these Rules of
Procedure. A point of order:
         A.   Can be raised at any time, even when another member has the floor
(this is the only time it is proper to interrupt another member who is
speaking);
         B.   Need not be seconded;
         C.   Is not debatable, but must be ruled upon by the Chairperson
immediately;
         D.   Has immediate priority over any other business.
      (9)   A Ruling of the Chairperson on any point of order may be appealed
to Council. However, such an appeal:
         A.   Must be seconded, and if there is no second, the ruling of the
Chairperson stands;
         B.   Is debatable;
         C.   Must be voted upon immediately, following any discussion;
         D.   Requires a majority of Councilmembers present to be sustained.
      (10)   Duties of the Chairperson shall be:
         A.   To conduct all meetings in an orderly manner in accordance with
these Rules of Procedure;
         B.   To rule on all points of order in the application of these Rules
of Procedure, with the advice of the parliamentarian;
         C.   To expedite the business of Council, with full and impartial
consideration of the individual rights of every member of Council and the
courtesy due every citizen.
      The Chairperson shall have the right to participate in the discussions of
Council, provided:
         A.   He or she has permission from the maker of the pending motion on
the floor to address Council on the question at hand; and
         B.   Such participation is in accordance with all rules of order.
      (11)   Robert's Rules of Order, Revised Edition, shall govern the conduct
of meetings in all situations not covered by these rules.
   (d)   Council Minutes.
      (1)   Minutes of the Council meetings should include the exact time, date
and place of the meetings, the name of the presiding officer, the names of
Councilmembers present and the names of other officers present.
       (2)   Minutes should be a complete and objective account of what
happened at the meeting and become a permanent record which may be referred to
in the future concerning all business discussed and all action taken.
      (3)   Actual discussion of each member need not be summarized, but every
main motion, whether adopted or rejected, should be recorded along with the
name of its maker and the vote taken of each member or other action taken on
it.

(Res. 1997-10. Passed 2-26-97.)
238.12   INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the policy of the Village to invest public funds in a
manner that will provide the highest investment return with maximum security,
safety and preservation of principal while meeting the daily cash flow needs of
the Village and conforming to applicable laws governing the investment of
public funds by an Ohio municipality. The Director of Finance is the investment
officer of the Village, charged with the responsibility for the purchase and
sale of investments and the implementation of and compliance with this
investment policy.
   (b)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
Village, including State and Federal funds held by it, other than funds held
and invested pursuant to the express terms of a trust agreement. The Director
of Finance is to routinely monitor the contents of the Village's investment
portfolio, the available markets and relative value of competing investments
and to adjust the portfolio accordingly.
   (c)   Objectives. The primary objectives, in priority order, of the
Village's investment activities are:
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the
investment program. Village investments should be undertaken in a manner that
seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain
this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on
individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of
the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The Village's investment portfolio should remain
sufficiently liquid to enable it to meet all operating requirements which might
be reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on Investment. The Village's investment portfolio should be
designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account this investment policy and
the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   (d)   Prudence.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
      (2)   The standard of prudence to be used by the Director of Finance
shall be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the context of
managing the overall portfolio. Acting in accordance with this investment
policy and exercising due diligence shall relieve the Director of Finance of
personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market
price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported to the
Council in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.
   (e)   Authorized Dealers and Financial Institutions.
      (1)   The Director of Finance will maintain a list of financial
institutions and approved securities broker/dealers, selected on the basis of
creditworthiness, who are authorized to provide investment services and who
qualify under Ohio R.C. 135.14(M)(1). These may include “primary” dealers or
regional dealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule
15c3-1 and are registered with the Ohio Department of Commerce to do business
in the State.
      (2)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become
qualified suppliers of investment transactions to the Village must provide to
the Director of Finance all of the following:
         A.   Audited annual financial statements;
         B.   Proof of good standing with the Comptroller of Currency or with

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
      
Chap. 290.   Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor’s Court
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Northfield has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Northfield ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Northfield, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed
by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor’s Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Summit County (the Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court) and the
magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript
of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to
the court of record. However, Rule 23 (A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury
trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a
jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor’s Court, in such cases, is further
limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his
or her right to a jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1)
his or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the Municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the Municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Northfield ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor’s Courts were authorized to
suspend the operator’s commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
         B.   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

408.03   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.

of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of
the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code
is substantially equivalent.

410.01   LICENSING OF TOW TRUCK OPERATORS OR AGENCIES; POUNDS.
   The Mayor, subject to the approval of Council, is hereby authorized to
license tow truck operators or agencies. Each agency shall provide a vehicle
pound in which vehicles may be stored in the manner hereinafter provided. Such
pounds shall be located in an area which is zoned for the same. Each pound
shall be reasonably secure to prevent loss or damage to stored vehicles and
shall be supervised adequately by the agency so operating the same.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82.)
410.02   REASONS FOR IMPOUNDING OF VEHICLES.
   Police officers are authorized to provide for the removal and impounding of
a vehicle under the following circumstances:
   (a)   When any vehicle is left unattended upon any street, bridge or
causeway and is so illegally parked so as to constitute a hazard or obstruction
to the normal movement of traffic, or so as to unreasonably interfere with
street cleaning or snow removal operations;
   (b)   When any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, is left on private residential property, as
defined in Section
452.05(d), or on private agricultural property, for at least four consecutive
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or
highway, for forty-eight consecutive hours or longer, without notification to
the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving such vehicle in such place, except
that when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic, it may be
ordered into storage immediately;
   (c)   When any vehicle has been stolen or operated without the consent of
the owner;
   (d)   When any vehicle displays illegal license plates or fails to display
the current lawfully required license plates;
   (e)   When any vehicle has been used in or connected with the commission of
a felony;
   (f)   When any vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable or
violates equipment provisions of this Traffic Code whereby its continued
operation would constitute a condition hazardous to life, limb or property;
   (g)   When any vehicle is left unattended due to the removal of an ill,
injured or arrested operator;
   (h)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who has failed to
stop in case of an accident or collision;
   (i)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who is driving
without a lawful license or while his or her license has been suspended or
revoked;
   (j)   When any vehicle is found for which two or more citation tags for
violations of this Traffic Code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required.
    (k)   When any vehicle has been parked in violation of any Municipality
parking ban, prohibition or restriction.
410.03   TOWING; RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRIVATE AGENCIES.
   (a)   Police officers are directed to ascertain which towing company a
disabled motorist, under Section
410.02(g), wishes to use in having his or her vehicle towed to safety, and, if
possible, shall so notify such towing company. Private towing companies will be
recommended by police officers only when requested to do so by the disabled
motorist.
   (b)   The police officer who orders a motor vehicle to be taken into custody
and towed by a private towing agency from the scene where found, shall make a
report of the general condition of the vehicle and a list of its contents found
in and about the interior. The person who tows the vehicle shall sign the
report prior to removing the vehicle from the scene. However, in the case of
junk, abandoned or stripped vehicles, and in the case of vehicles towed away
under the emergency snow ban, it shall not be necessary that the police remain
at the scene until the arrival of the towing agency. In any case of urgent
police necessity, the officer may leave the scene, but shall return immediately
after disposition of the emergency. If the vehicle has been towed away by an
agency designated by the Municipality, the police officer shall go immediately
to the towing agency, reinspect the vehicle and obtain the signature of the tow
truck operator or the agency representative.
   (c)   No person shall remove tires, parts, equipment or anything of value
from a motor vehicle taken into tow.
   (d)   The tow truck operator and the agency which he or she represents shall
then be held responsible for the safekeeping of such vehicle until such time as
it is reclaimed by the owner. If the vehicle is not maintained in the same
condition as when received or has had anything detached or removed from it, the
towing agency shall be liable and shall compensate the owner accordingly.
   (e)   A conviction under this section for failure to fulfill the
responsibility to properly safekeep a vehicle or to compensate for damage or
loss shall result in the forfeiture of the agency’s right and authority to
conduct any further towing transactions for the Police Department.
   (f)   All tow truck operators shall notify the Police Department when towing
a vehicle from the Municipality.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82.)
410.04   STORAGE FEE FOR STORAGE AT VEHICLE POUND.
   Whenever any vehicle, except a bicycle, is stored in a vehicle pound for any
reason, a reasonable charge per day or fraction thereof can be imposed and
collected by the agency.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82.)
410.05   NOTICE AND REDEMPTION.
   (a)   The police officer or person in charge of any impounded vehicle shall
inform the owner or other person claiming an impounded vehicle, of the nature
and circumstances of the violation because of which such vehicle has been
impounded. If such owner or other person claiming such impounded vehicle
furnishes evidence of his or her identity and ownership, together with a
receipt from the Clerk of the Mayor’s Court, showing the payment of all fees
for violation of provisions of this Traffic Code, the impounded vehicle shall
be surrendered by the agent or person in charge thereof, who shall obtain a
receipt for such impounded vehicle.
   The cost of towing such vehicle, including storage fees, is an agency matter
and shall be so collected by it.
   (b)   In case protest is made against the payment of any impounding or
storage fee, the agent or person in charge of such impounded vehicle, upon
satisfactory evidence of the identity and ownership of the person claiming such
impounded vehicle and upon the furnishing of a bond in an amount as set by rule
of the Mayor’s Court, by the owner or driver of such vehicle, to the
satisfaction of the Clerk of the Mayor’s Court, conditioned that such owner or
driver shall appear before the Mayor’s Court to answer to the violation because
of which such vehicle has been impounded, shall surrender the impounded vehicle
to the claimant. It shall thereupon be the duty of the police officer having
knowledge of the facts to forthwith institute the proper proceedings in the
Mayor’s Court, charging the owner or driver of such vehicle with the violation
of the ordinance for which the vehicle was impounded.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82.)
410.06   IMPOUNDING FEE.
   A fee of ten dollars ($10.00) to cover the cost of removal, in addition to
the storage fee provided in Section
410.04, shall be assessed against the owner or other person claiming any
vehicle.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82; Ord. 2015-65. Passed 10-14-15.)
410.07   POUND RECORDS.
   The agent or person in charge of the vehicle pound shall keep the names of
all owners of vehicles impounded, license plate numbers and the nature and
circumstances of each violation, as well as the disposition of each case. The
Clerk of the Mayor’s Court shall account for all fees collected under this
chapter and pay the same into the Municipal Treasury.
(Ord. 1982-22. Passed 4-14-82.)
410.08   IMPOUNDING OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES; FEES.
   (a)   Storage Fees. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
410.04, whenever any commercial vehicle is impounded and stored, either in a

in excess of twenty-four hours shall be charged for the storage of all tractors
and trucks not exceeding two tons net weight, and a charge of fifteen dollars
($15.00) per day or fraction thereof for storage in excess of twenty-four hours
shall be charged for the storage of all commercial units, trucks and commercial
tractors in excess of two tons net weight.
   (b)   Impounding Fee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
410.06, a fee of twenty- five dollars ($25.00) per hour, plus a prorated fee
for each fraction of an hour in excess of the first hour, shall be charged to
cover the costs of removal of commercial vehicles.
   (c)   Assessment of Fees. The storage and impounding fees provided for in
this section shall be assessed against the owner or other person claiming such
impounded vehicles.
   (d)   Release of Vehicles. Impounded commercial vehicles shall be released
to the owner or other person claiming such impounded vehicle in accordance with
Section
410.05, provided that proof is presented by the owner or person claiming such
vehicle that all towing, removal and storage charges and fees have been paid in
addition to the fine imposed.

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(R.C. § 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(R.C. § 4511.131)
414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:

slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or

R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court
also may impose a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
         D.   Notwithstanding divisions (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of
offenders to whom division (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., or (d)(1)D. of this section
applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under R.C. §§
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in division (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
      (4)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, points shall
be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically
supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic wireless
communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of division (a) of this section shall inform the operator that
the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:
         A.   Access the device without a warrant, unless the operator
voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Electronic wireless communications device.”
         A.   Includes any of the following:
            1.   A wireless telephone;
            2.   A text-messaging device;

432.45   USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICES BY MINORS OR
PROBATIONARY DRIVERS WHILE DRIVING PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of 18 years and no holder of a probationary driver's license shall drive a
motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Division (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:
      (1)   A person using an electronic wireless communications device for
emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar
emergency agency or entity;

a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section, whoever violates
this section shall be fined $300. In addition, the court shall impose a class
seven suspension of the person’s driver’s license or permit for a definite
period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied
offenses of similar import under R.C. § 2941.25.

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle- related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C.
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified on Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw a blood sample under this division may refuse to
withdraw blood under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical
welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The
bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in
accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less that the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H. or (a)(1)I., or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician- paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (1)   Definition. “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test of tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test of tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192) (Ord. 2003-33. Passed 7-23-03.)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving

requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other

proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division
(h) of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, the court shall suspend
any jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under
that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed
for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the

698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (b) of this section.
   (j)   (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment
program under this section unless the treatment program complies with the

Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined

five- year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil action that involves the offender or delinquent child who
is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.

   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall display the operator's driver's
license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

$1,000; and notwithstanding §
698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (Editor's note: Section
436.07 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 4507.02(B) -

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is

offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other

state.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §§ 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable.
The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle upon any public roads
and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point suspension, a
misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to a
minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and not more than two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00);
         C.   A license suspension under division (e) of this section;
         D.   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender's name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender's vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle

assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)
(2).
   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor's

violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender's driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).
      (1)   When permitted as specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.021, if the court
grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

to come in contact with the body under normal operation, and no person shall
disconnect any part of the original suspension system of the vehicle to defeat
the safe operation of that system.

not apply to any specially designed or modified passenger car, multipurpose
passenger vehicle, or truck when operated off a street or highway in races and
similar events.
   (g)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States

section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in a
motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in R.C.
§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
   (d)   When any child who is at least eight years of age but not older than
15 years of age, and who is not otherwise required by division (a), (b), or (c)
of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   (1)   Whoever violates division (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(1)B. of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a
State law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   All fines imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section shall
be forwarded to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Child Highway Safety
Fund created by R.C. § 4511.81(I).
(R.C. § 4511.81(A) - (H), (K), (L))
438.30   USE OF OCCUPANT RESTRAINING DEVICES.
   (a)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a

Vehicles attesting to that fact. Upon such registration, the Registrar shall
make that information available in the law enforcement automated data system. A
person included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not
required to have the affidavit obtained in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4513.263)
438.31   IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES. (REPEALED)
   (Editor's note: Section
438.31 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 4511.83(A),
(B), (E)) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
438.32   OPERATION OF RADIOS OR OTHER SOUND-MAKING DEVICES OR INSTRUMENTS.
   (a)   No person operating or occupying a motor vehicle within the Village
shall operate, or amplify the sound produced by, a radio, tape player or other
sound-making device or instrument, from within the motor vehicle, so that the
sound is plainly audible at a distance of 100 feet or more from the motor
vehicle.
   (b)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any law enforcement
motor vehicle equipped with any communication device necessary in the
performance of law enforcement duties or to any emergency vehicle equipped with
any communication device necessary in the performance of emergency procedures.
   (c)   The provisions of this section do not apply to the noise made by a
horn or other warning device required or permitted by State law.
   (d)   As used in this section, “plainly audible” means any sound produced by
a radio, tape player or other mechanical or electronic sound-making device or
instrument, from within the interior or exterior of a motor vehicle, including
sound produced by a portable sound-making device, that can be clearly heard
outside the vehicle by a person using his or her normal hearing faculties, at a
distance of 100 feet or more from the motor vehicle.
   (e)   Any law enforcement personnel who hears a sound that is plainly
audible shall be entitled to measure the sound according to the following
standards:
      (1)   The primary means of detection shall be by means of the officer’s
ordinary auditory senses as long as the officer’s hearing is not enhanced by
any mechanical device, such as a microphone or hearing aid.
      (2)   The officer must have a direct line of sight and hearing to the
motor vehicle producing the sound so that he or she can readily identify the
offending motor vehicle and the distance involved.
      (3)   The officer need not determine the particular words or phrases
being produced or the name of any song or artist producing the sound. The
detection of a rhythmic bass, reverberating-type sound is sufficient to
constitute a plainly audible sound.
   (f)   The motor vehicle from which the sound is produced must be located
(stopped, standing or moving) within the Village. Parking lots and driveways
are included.
   (g)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the offender persists in
generating or permitting to be generated unreasonable noise after reasonable
warning or request to desist, such offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree. The penalty shall be as provided in Section
408.01. In addition, for any violation of this section, the sound equipment is
hereby deemed contraband and is subject to seizure and forfeiture pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2933.41 through 2933.43 and Section
608.16 of the General Offenses Code.
(Ord. 1996-49. Passed 8-28-96.)
438.33   AIR BAGS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Air bag.” Has the same meaning as in 49 C.F.R. § 579.4, as
amended.
      (2)   “Counterfeit air bag.” An air bag displaying a mark identical or
similar to the genuine mark of a motor vehicle manufacturer, without the
authorization of the motor vehicle manufacturer.
      (3)   “Nonfunctional air bag.” Any of the following:
         A.   A replacement air bag that has been previously deployed or
damaged;
         B.   A replacement air bag that has an electrical fault that is
detected by the air bag diagnostic system of a vehicle after the air bag is
installed;
         C.   A counterfeit air bag, air bag cover, or some other object that
is installed in a vehicle to deceive an owner or operator of the vehicle into
believing that a functional air bag has been installed.
   (b)   No person shall install or reinstall in any motor vehicle a
counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.
   (c)   No person shall knowingly manufacture, import, sell, or offer for sale
any of the following:
      (1)   A counterfeit air bag;
      (2)   A nonfunctional air bag;
      (3)   Any other object that is intended to be installed in a motor
vehicle to fulfill the function of an air bag and that is not in conformance
with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208 for the make, model, and
model year of the vehicle in which the object is intended to be installed.
   (d)   No person shall knowingly sell, install, or reinstall a device in a
motor vehicle that causes the diagnostic system of a vehicle to inaccurately
indicate that the vehicle is equipped with a functional air bag.
   (e)   (1)   Whoever violates division (b) or (d) of this section is guilty
of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.

this section by a bicycle operator, electric bicycle operator, or motor vehicle
operator when the trier of fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle
operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a

the designated accessible parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally
entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under division (e) of this section, or at

provided under division (e) of this section or at an accessible clearly marked
parking location provided in or on a privately owned parking lot, parking
garage, or other parking area and designated in accordance with that division.
   (g)   When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a
person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates issued to the person or
organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.

452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Police Chief. If the Police Chief
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner's and any lienholder's
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief's records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders

include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow- away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §

         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
606.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13   SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, "residence" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider

(R.C. § 955.22)
   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if a violation of division (d) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.

county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that §
618.20 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part
of the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability
insurance required under division (f)(1) of this section in an amount,
exclusive of interest and costs, that equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the
court makes a final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a
violation of division (d) of this section and at the discretion of the dog
warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions described in division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound
at the owner’s expense.

of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be
confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of division (e) of
this section or at the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.

      (8)   Whoever violates division (f)(1), (f)(3), or (f)(4) of this section
is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(M))
      (9)   Whoever violates division (j)(4) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(N))
      (10)   A.   If a dog is confined at the county dog pound pursuant to
division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses, including medical care and boarding of the dog for 60
days, expected to be incurred by the county dog pound in caring for the dog
pending the determination. The county dog warden may draw from the security any
actual costs incurred in caring for the dog.
         B.   If the person ordered to post security under division (l)(10)A.
of this section does not do so within ten days of the confinement of the
animal, the dog is forfeited, and the county dog warden may determine the
disposition of the dog unless the court issues an order that specifies
otherwise.

determination under division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the
security provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is greater than that
actual cost, the county dog warden shall remit the difference between the

law enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority
of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the
purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or Ohio R.C. 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was
the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court

on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to

660.07   STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES, UNLICENSED COLLECTOR’S VEHICLES, AND OTHER
VEHICLES.
   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any
motor vehicle which is three years old or older; extensively damaged, such
damage including but not limited to any of the following: missing wheels,
tires, motor, or transmission; apparently inoperable; and having a fair market
value of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) or less, that is left in
the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the
person having the right to possession of the property, except if the person is
operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the
authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under
authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on which the motor
vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental
authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of the property
can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial
operation that is permitted to be operated on the premises; or if the motor
vehicle is a collector’s vehicle. The fact that there is a carport roof, tarp,
or other type of covering over the vehicle does not prevent the vehicle from
being considered to be left in the open.
      (2)   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
Municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open. All unlicensed collector’s
vehicles shall be fully concealed from view from the street and neighboring
properties by means of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other
suitable obstruction and shall comply with all Municipal ordinances with
respect to vehicles having to be stored on certain areas of the property and
surfaces.
      (3)   A police officer or the zoning authority may send notice, by
personal service or certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person
having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor
vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor
vehicle either shall be housed in a fully enclosed garage or other suitable
fully enclosed structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. If a person having the right to
possession of the property has been convicted of a violation of this section
within the past one year, the notice, 72-hour, and 10-day period provisions
contained in this section shall not apply. In that event, it shall be an
offense to leave a junk motor vehicle in the open on private property, and a
citation therefor may be issued without the provision of prior notice of the
violation, without the vehicle having been on the property for at least 72
hours, and without the need for the vehicle to be left on the property for a
period of more than 10 days before issuing the citation.
      (5)   The fact that there is a carport, tarp, or other type of covering
over a junk motor vehicle or unlicensed collector’s vehicle does not prevent
the vehicle from being considered to be left in the open. All covers placed on
automobiles, trailers, boats, or other vehicles that are left in the open and
are not considered junk motor vehicles or unlicensed collector’s vehicles must
be specifically made for the type of vehicle in question, in good condition,
and not contain any holes, rips, paint splotches, or significant stains.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each
day on which a violation occurs shall be considered a separate offense.

means weeds that either: exceed six inches in height, contain mature seeds, are
ready to spread, are of any type or height and located in gardens or flower or
other beds, and/or are considered invasive weeds.

that offensive weeds or offensive grass are growing on land within the
Municipality, written notice shall be provided to the owner and/or occupant
having control of such parcel that offensive weeds or offensive grass exist
upon such land, and that the same must be cut and/or destroyed within three
days of the receipt of such notice. The written notice shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the proper address; sent by
registered mail to the proper address; hand-delivered to a resident of the
property; or affixed to the front door or other conspicuous place on the
property or front side of the primary structure on the property. In addition,
notice may also be provided by placing a single notice in a newspaper of
general circulation within the Municipality. Only one notice per calendar year
is required per parcel. If, after notice has been provided in accordance with
this section, the Building and Zoning Inspector determines that a subsequent
violation has occurred on a particular parcel, the Building and Zoning
Inspector may proceed with any action permitted by this section without any
further notice being required.
   (f)   If the owner, occupant, or person having charge of the parcel in
violation of this section fails to comply with the notice to cut and/or destroy
such offensive weeds or offensive grass, the Building and Zoning Inspector may
request the Police Department to issue a citation to the property owner and/or
occupant and/or the Building and Zoning Inspector may cause such offensive
weeds or offensive grass to be cut and/or destroyed by employing the necessary
labor and equipment to perform such tasks to bring the property into compliance
with this section. The charge for cutting and/or destroying the offensive weeds
and/or offensive grass shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) per man hour and
shall be charged back to the owner of the parcel.

section have been cut and/or destroyed by the Municipality, the Administrative
Clerk shall send a statement to the owner of the parcel demanding payment for

dollars ($100.00) shall be imposed upon the owner of the parcel and added to
the above charges. Council shall then make a written return to the County
Fiscal Officer of its action under subsections (e) and (f) hereof, showing the
total charges for the performance of the labor along with any fees related to
the enforcement action, together with a proper description of the premises upon
which these services were performed. Such amounts shall be entered upon the tax
duplicate, shall be a lien upon the parcel from the date of entry and shall be
collected as other taxes are collected and returned to the Municipality by the
County Fiscal Officer. Such remedy shall be in addition to the penalties
provided in subsections (e), (f), (g), and/or (h) hereof.
   (h)   A person violating this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

   (a)   No person shall receive, retain, or dispose of property of another
knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the property has been
obtained through commission of a theft offense.
   (b)   It is not a defense to a charge of receiving stolen property in

represented to the accused person as being obtained through the commission of a
theft offense.

672.03   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;

property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

requalification certification described in division (b)(6)C. of this section,
and if the identification card includes that certification, the identification
card shall serve as the firearms requalification certification for the retired

firearms requalification program that is approved for purposes of firearms
requalification required under Ohio R.C. 109.801, the retired peace officer’s
successful completion of the firearms requalification program requalifies the

years from the date on which the program was successfully completed, and the
requalification is valid during that five-year period. If a retired peace

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (d)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)

intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the

travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned

applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for

(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.

   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall

consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or
         2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for misdemeanors
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall not exceed 18
months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.

802.01   PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens of the Village of Northfield through the
regulation of adult entertainment businesses in the Village of Northfield. It
is the intent of this chapter to regulate adult entertainment businesses, as
defined herein, so as to prevent crime, protect the Municipality's retail trade
and property values, and, in general, preserve the quality of life in the
Municipality, while at the same time not suppressing First Amendment rights.
Specifically, the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including adult entertainment. Similarly, it is not
the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults
to adult materials or services protected by the First Amendment, or to deny
access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment in their
intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or services.
   (b)   The City Council has consulted with other communities that have
experience with adult entertainment establishments. Specifically, Council
members have had discussions with officials from Painesville Township and the
City of Brook Park. Further, the City Council has reviewed evidence concerning
the secondary effects of adult uses on the community in the cases of City of
Renton v Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v American Mini
Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and from studies in other communities, including, but not limited to,
Mayfield, Ohio, Brook Park, Ohio, and New York, New York.

as provided in paragraph (a)(2) hereof. For nonresidential buildings, except
for schools and other public places of assembly, this provision may be waived,
in writing, by the owner and occupant of a building nearer than 200 feet from
the proposed well site or storage equipment, provided that in no case shall
such well or equipment be nearer than 100 feet from such building. Such written
authorization shall be included with the application;
      (2)   They shall be 300 feet from schools or other public places of
assembly as defined in the Ohio Basic Building Code;
      (3)   They shall be 300 feet from adjacent properties;
      (4)   They shall be 200 feet from a public street, provided that storage
tanks and equipment may be within 100 feet of a public street right-of-way; and
      (5)   Any greater distances which may be required pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 1509 shall govern.
These spacing requirements shall remain in effect until the well has been
plugged to the satisfaction of the Municipality and the Division of Oil and
Gas.
   (b)   Access Drives.
      (1)   Access drives from drilling sites or storage equipment to the
public street shall be located to have the minimum impact on adjacent
residential properties.
      (2)   Access drives shall be constructed of gravel, plank or appropriate
material, as determined by the Building and Zoning Inspector to assure that the
surface is dust-free and adequate for the vehicles intended.
      (3)   Gravel may be required by the Building and Zoning Inspector along
the access drive near the public street to prevent mud and dirt from being
tracked onto the public streets.
      (4)   A gate shall be installed across the access drive at a point
adjacent to the public road. Such gate shall be locked at all times when the
access road is not being used for well related purposes. Adjacent to the gate
shall be sufficient barriers by fencing, landscaping or mounding to reasonably
prevent unauthorized vehicle access to the well or storage sites. Sketch
drawings and/or written descriptions of the proposed gates and barriers,
adequate to indicate how the objective of preventing unauthorized access shall
be achieved, shall be submitted with the permit application.
   (c)   General Requirements.
      (1)   No person engaged in drilling or operating any well shall permit
gas to escape or be vented into the air unless a plan for such venting, stating
the amounts of gas to be vented, the times and frequency of venting and
precautions to be taken, is first submitted, in writing, to the Fire Chief and
approved by him or her in writing.
      (2)   Within thirty days after any oil and/or gas well has been completed
for the production of oil and/or gas, or abandoned, the permittee shall remove
any drilling rig or derrick, remove the excess sludge or mud, fill all pits and
excavations, level off the surface of the working area, not allow any
accumulation of sludge, oil or other offensive or dangerous substances, keep
his or her premises in a sanitary and sightly condition, restore any disturbed
drainage facilities and leave the premises in such a condition that no pooling
of surface water shall result.
      (3)   Wooden derricks or steam-powered rigs shall not be permitted in
connection with drilling or any workover operations.
      (4)   Two dual-controlled, fluid-operated blowout preventers, with
working pressures equal to the maximum anticipated wellhead pressures, shall be
used for all drilling or completion operations involving the use of drill pipe
or tubing after the surface casing has been set. The mechanical operation of
the preventers shall be checked every twenty-four hours and shall be tested
with pump pressure with enough frequency to insure good working order at all
times.
      (5)   No oil, waste water, sludge water or salt water, produced or used
in connection with the drilling operation or production of oil or gas wells,
shall be disposed of within the Municipality or not be permitted to empty into
any sanitary sewer, storm sewer or surface drainage, unless, in an emergency,
such waste is to be used by the Municipality and authorized for such use by the
Mayor. However, temporary repositories for salt water, waste water or sludge
water and basic sediment and water may be constructed of concrete, steel or
other material and in the latter case such pits for temporary deposits shall be
constructed so that no seepage shall result therefrom and so that surface water
resulting from water drainage or rain cannot drain into such pits.
      (6)   Within six months of such completion or abandonment, the area shall
be re-landscaped to assure that all areas, other than access drives, are
restored with natural ground cover consistent with surrounding areas to avoid
any further erosion.
      (7)   All producing wells, wellheads, tank batteries, pumping units and
equipment appurtenant thereto shall be enclosed and protected by a six-foot
galvanized or aluminum chain link-type fence with matching-type gates and
effectively screened with evergreen plantings to the approval of the Building
and Zoning Inspector.

of 100 barrels (4,500 gallons), and a maximum of two storage tanks shall be
permitted for each well.
      (9)   The premises shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition free
from rubbish of every character, at all times, during the drilling operation
and as long thereafter as oil and/or gas is being produced therefrom. The
premises of all permittees shall be kept clear of high grass, weeds and
combustible trash, or any other rubbish or debris that might constitute a fire
hazard, within a radius of 100 feet around any oil tank or tanks or producing
wells.

contractual rights to use the surface, or upon leases not owned by the
permittee, or into the alleys, streets, gutters or sewers of the Municipality.
      (3)   Should any mud be carried on public streets from a drilling site,
the permittee shall be required to clean up the streets to the satisfaction of
the Municipality. Failure of a permittee to clean up the public streets to the
satisfaction of the Municipality, or failure to take specific steps to reduce
mud at a given location, as requested by the Municipality, shall be grounds for
revocation of a permit and forfeiture of the bond posted under Section
862.06(e), and shall also constitute a misdemeanor punishable under Section
862.99.
      (4)   All trucks hauling oil, sludge water, salt water, and petroleum
products or byproducts shall be closed and leakproof at all times, and the
intake vent and outlet valves and pump connections shall be watertight and

per hour with a minimum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per inspection, and the owner
shall reimburse the Municipality for all accrued costs for such additional
inspections.
   (d)   Insurance. An applicant, before being issued a permit hereunder, shall
post and maintain with the Building and Zoning Inspector, subject to the
Mayor's approval, satisfactory evidence of liability insurance and yearly
renewal coverage to compensate parties other than the applicant for damage
arising from the activities permitted hereunder, in an amount of not less than
five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for property loss for each occurrence
and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for bodily injury for each

amount of the surety bond prescribed above. The surety bond provided for in
this section shall be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in
the State. The Building and Zoning Inspector shall not approve any bond until
it is personally signed and acknowledged by both principal and surety, or as to
either by his or her attorney in fact, with a certified copy of the power of
attorney attached thereto.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall not approve such bond
unless there is attached a certificate of the Ohio Superintendent of Insurance
that the company is authorized to transact a fidelity and surety business in
the State. All bonds shall be given in a form to be prescribed by the Building
and Zoning Inspector and shall run to the Municipality as obligee.
      (3)   When the Building and Zoning Inspector finds that an applicant has
failed to comply with regulations hereunder, he or she shall make a finding of
fact and declare any surety bond (or cash), filed to ensure compliance,
forfeited in an amount sufficient to correct any condition that adversely
affects the public health and safety or any condition that is prescribed in
Section
862.04, whereupon the Building and Zoning Inspector shall certify the
forfeiture to the Director of Law who shall proceed to collect the amount
thereof, with the approval of Council. In lieu of forfeiture, the surety, at
its option, may cause the condition resulting in forfeiture to be corrected or
pay to the Finance Director the costs thereof. All funds collected under this
section may be expended by the Municipality to correct the conditions
necessitating forfeiture.
      (4)   The owner may be released from the surety bond one year after the
Building and Zoning Inspector has received written confirmation from the
Division of Oil and Gas that the well has been satisfactorily plugged in
accordance with the regulations of the Division. Until the surety bond is
released by the Building and Zoning Inspector in writing, such bond shall
remain in full force and effect for the benefit of the Municipality.

   (a)   On all taxable income received during the effective period of this

(Ord. 1994-36. Passed 8-10-94; Ord. 2003-41. Passed 8-27-03; Ord. 2004-34.
Passed 7-14-04. Ord. 2006-51. Passed 10-25-06.)
890.04   EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
      The Municipal income tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect
to the salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation, and with respect to
the net profits of businesses, professions or other activities, earned on and
after October 1, 1968. (Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)
890.05   METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to the Municipal income
tax, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession
both within and outside the boundaries of the Municipality shall disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
Municipality, then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Municipality for the purpose of Municipal income taxation. The
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the Municipality, in the absence of actual records thereof,
shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality, during the taxable period to the average net book value of all
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
the preceding paragraph, real property includes property rented or leased by
the taxpayer, the value of which shall be determined by multiplying the annual
rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services performed anywhere.
   (b)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result. (Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)
890.06   SALES MADE IN THE MUNICIPALITY.
   As used in Section
890.05(a)(3) “sales made in the Municipality” means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Municipality.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality, and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality, regardless of
where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.
(Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)
890.07   TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
890.05(a), or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving this total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
890.05.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Municipality.
(Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)
890.08   RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under Section
890.03(c) to (g), only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived,
whether rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer, in whole or in part.
   Where gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month. Further, in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares in crops or
when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross of net profits derived
from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month. Further, the person who operates a licensed
rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income
exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.
(Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)
890.09   OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1995, allocable to the Municipality, may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the
Municipality until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
   (b)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the
Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits
to the Municipality.
   (c)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner in
which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
(Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)

authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer, showing the

(Ord. 1968-82. Passed 8-28-68.)

allocated to the Municipality by reason of transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates

activity, or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he
or she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits

liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall

the tax withheld or otherwise paid. The Administrator is hereby authorized to
require such verification as is needed to determine the actual liability and
the validity of the expenses claimed. Persons from whom such tax is withheld or

purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner who chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (b)(1)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (b)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the appointment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (a) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division. A taxpayer shall make the
election allowed under this division in writing on or with the taxpayer's net
profit return, or if applicable, a timely filed amended net profit return or a
timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election applies to the taxable year
for which that return or appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years,
until the taxpayer revokes the election. The taxpayer shall make the initial
election with the tax administrator of each municipal corporation with which,
after applying the apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the
taxpayer is required to file a net profit return for that taxable year. A
taxpayer shall not be required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal
corporation in which a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to
file a net profit return with that municipal corporation due to business
operations that are unrelated to the employee's or owner's activity at the
qualifying remote work location. After the taxpayer makes the initial election,
the election applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer
conducts business. The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit
return with a municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located in such
municipal corporation. Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from
making a new election under this division after properly revoking a prior
election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (a)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (b)(2) of this section:
         A.   For the purpose of division (a)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (a)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (a)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (a)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (a)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to this chapter.

891.051   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
891.052 of this chapter or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipal Corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(1)B. of this
section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         C.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
891.091 of this chapter.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
         B.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         A.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         B.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite

            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages as provided
in Section
891.051 of this chapter.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding
requirements described in division (b)(1) of this section shall apply only if,
with respect to the employee’s qualifying wages described in that division, the
employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal
corporation in which the employee’s principal place of work is located.
    (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
891.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
891.051 of this chapter.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
      Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income lax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

891.19(a) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
891.081 of this chapter.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
891.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
891.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a

current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if the
amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
For the purposes of this section;
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
891.091 of this chapter.

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
891.091 of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

891.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.096 of this chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
891.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

the taxpayer’s social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the municipality's tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to

payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
tax return under division (g) of this section, the tax administrator shall not
make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return
on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the
extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first. If a tax
administrator violates this division of this section, the municipal corporation
shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to
such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). This
division of this section does not apply to an extension received under division
(g)(1)D. of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the
taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (g)(1)D. of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (g)(1)D. of this section.
      (4)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this

taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (4) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (h)(3) of this section apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Municipality's income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both of the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the Municipality.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the Municipality and
does not expect to be subject to the Municipality's income tax for the taxable
year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales with the Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services with the Municipality, make any sales in the Municipality, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Municipality during the
taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
Municipality for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Municipal income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations.” The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the time
stamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving the payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
891.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
891.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation’s
resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

891.095   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
891.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (a)(2) of this

prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
891.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18 of this chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been

later than the fast day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
891.10(a)(4) of this chapter.

federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts

      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or

obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.

891.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board’s final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

whichever is later; or

         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may

      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately

   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
891.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
891.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.

imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

property within the Municipality shall first apply to the Building and Zoning
Inspector for a permit which shall be issued without cost.
(Ord. 1967-55. Passed 6-12-67.)
1026.02   CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following are the specifications for construction and materials for
sidewalks and are required of sidewalks to be constructed or reconstructed:
   (a)   Excavation. Excavation shall be made to a uniform depth of four inches
below the finished grade of the sidewalks, except at driveways, where the depth
shall be six inches for ten feet of length. Sidewalk grade shall be determined
and approved by the Municipality.
   (b)   Embankment. Where the existing ground is below the new sidewalk grade,
any sod within the proposed sidewalk construction shall be removed. The
material required to bring the finished surface to grade shall be earth, sand
and gravel excavated from other areas or bank run sand and gravel approved by
the Municipality. Embankment shall be compacted by means of a small roller, air
tamping or hand tamping to ninety-five percent of the material's maximum
laboratory dry weight. Embankment material which does not contain sufficient
moisture to compact to a maximum density shall be sprinkled with water, and
material containing excessive moisture shall be permitted to dry to proper
moisture content before compacting.
   (c)   Forms. The sidewalk shall be constructed between wood or metal forms
and the height shall be equal to the thickness of the walks except at
driveways. Forms shall be securely set with the upper side conforming to the
line and grade as designated by the Municipality. Forms shall be cleaned and
oiled after each use and flexible forms shall be used on curves. Forms shall be
set so the walk will have a uniform cross slope of three- eighths of an inch
per foot with the low side toward the street centerline. All covers pertaining
to shut-off boxes, manhole frames and other similar fixtures shall be adjusted
to the grade of the complete walk prior to placing the concrete. All forms
shall be inspected by the Municipality before any concrete is placed.
   (d)   Joints. Contraction joins that are one-eighth of an inch in thickness
shall be used to divide the walk for its full width by using a double-edge
edging tool every five feet. An expansion joint one-half inch in width shall be
provided for the entire width and thickness of the concrete for every fifty
feet of length and where the walk abuts driveways, steps, curb, manholes, catch
basins or building foundations.
   (e)   Material. Concrete for sidewalks and driveways shall be Portland
cement conforming to the State of Ohio Department of Transportation
Construction and Material Specifications, Item 499, Class “C” limestone or slag
(no gravel aggregate permitted). Expansion joint material shall be one-half
inch pre-molded bituminous strip of full concrete depth.
   (f)   Placing and Finishing. No concrete shall be placed as sidewalk when
the temperature of the air or ground is below forty degrees Fahrenheit. The
subgrade shall be adequately moistened prior to placing the concrete and the
concrete shall be deposited and compacted in a single layer. It shall be struck
off with a templet and smoothed with a float to obtain a sandy texture. All
four top edges of each sidewalk block shall be rounded to a one-fourth inch
radius with a suitable edging tool.
   (g)   Curing and Protection. As soon as the concrete has hardened
sufficiently to prevent its being marked, it shall be covered with wet burlap
or a polyethylene sheet. The burlap cover shall be kept continuously wet for a
period of seventy-two hours for sidewalks and seven days for driveways. The
polyethylene sheet shall be retained for the same period. A waterproof membrane
for curing may be used immediately after the free water has disappeared from
the surface. All exposed surfaces of the concrete shall be sealed by spraying
thereon a uniform application of curing membrane in such manner as to provide a
continuous uniform film without marring the surface of the concrete. The curing
material may be applied with a hand spray at a minimum rate of one gallon for
each 200 square feet of surface treated. Curing material shall be thoroughly
agitated immediately prior to application. (Ord. 1967-55. Passed 6-12-67.)
1026.03   REMOVAL FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.

   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after receipt by

      (3)   Within sixty days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and
in no event later than thirty days prior to said cancellation, the service
provider shall obtain and furnish to the Village replacement insurance policies

      (4)   All insurance policies required herein shall be written with an
insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Ohio in relation to
the specific type of insurance required.

determination of the applicant's ability to meet the needs of this chapter.
   (f)   General Indemnification. Each service provider shall protect, defend,
indemnify, and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials,
officers, employees, agents, representatives, and volunteers harmless from and
against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, damages, liens, losses,
and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit or defense,
arising out of, resulting from, or alleged to arise out of or result from the
negligent, careless, or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act, or

and provide to the Village a bond, escrow, deposit, letter of credit, or other
financial surety to ensure compliance with this chapter and R.C. Chapter 4939.
The financial surety must also be in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of
removal, as established by the Engineer, of all facilities owned or operated by
that service provider.
      (2)   The Village may, at its discretion, draw on the financial surety to
remove abandoned facilities, remove or repair damaged facilities, or repair
damage to any Village property caused by the owner or operator of the facility,
its agent, or the facility itself. In such event, the owner or operator shall
cause the financial surety to be replenished to its prior amount within ten
business days after the Village notifies the owner or operator that it has
drawn on the financial surety.

   (c)   Rights Permitted. No consent granted under Section
1048.02 shall convey any right, title, or interest in the public right-of-way,
but shall be deemed a consent only to occupy or use the public right-of-way for
the limited purposes granted by the consent. Further, no consent shall be
construed as any warranty of title.
   (d)   Height. For a new wireless support structure, the overall height of

expense and the service provider shall promptly undertake and complete the
required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer
prevent such permanent restoration.
   (p)   Damage to Service Provider's Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support
Structure. Unless directly and proximately caused by the willful, intentional,
or malicious acts of the Village, the Village shall not be liable for any
damage to or loss of any small cell facility and wireless support structure in
the public right-of-way of the Village as a result of or in connection with,
but not limited to, any public works, public improvements, construction,
excavation, grading, filling, salting, snow removal, or work of any kind in the
public right-of- way by or on behalf of the Village.
   (q)   Duty to Provide Information. Within ten days of a written request from
the Village, each service provider shall furnish the Village with documentation
sufficient to show that the service provider has complied with all requirements
of this chapter.
   (r)   Assignments or Transfers of Consent. Consent to occupy or use the
public right-of- way may be, directly or indirectly, transferred, assigned, or
disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation, or other act of the service
provider, by operation of law or otherwise, without consent of the Village, so
long as:
      (1)   The Village is notified of the proposed transfer on or before the
date of transfer; and
      (2)   The transferee shall fully comply with this chapter within sixty
days of the transfer, including, but not limited to:
         A.   All information required by the application for consent to occupy
or use the public right-of-way pursuant to Section
1048.02; and
         B.   Any other information reasonably required by the Village.
   (s)   Revocation of Consent. Consent granted by the Village to occupy or use
the public right-of-way of the Village may be revoked for any one of the
following reasons:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation, or
excavation at an unauthorized location.
      (2)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation, or
excavation in violation of Village or State safety and/or construction
requirements.
      (3)   Material misrepresentation or lack of candor by or on behalf of a
service provider in any permit application or registration required by the
Village.
      (4)   Abandonment of a small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure in the public right-of-way.
      (5)   Failure to relocate or remove a small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure or failure to restore the public right-of-way, as required by
this chapter.
      (6)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the service provider.
      (7)   The small cell facility and/or wireless support structure is in a
state of disrepair which creates a public nuisance.
      (8)   Violation of material provisions of this chapter.
      (9)   Construction under the consent is not commenced within two years of
the consent approval date.
   (t)   Notice and Duty to Cure. In the event the Building and Zoning
Inspector believes grounds exist for revocation of consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way or construction permit, the Building and Zoning Inspector
shall give the service provider written notice of the apparent violation or
noncompliance, providing a short and concise statement of the nature and
general facts of the violation or noncompliance, and providing the service
provider a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty days to furnish
evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
   (u)   Reservation by Village for Future Uses. The Village may reserve space
for future public safety or transportation uses in the public right-of-way, or
on a wireless support structure or pole owned by the Village. Said reservation
of space shall be set forth in a documented plan, subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission. A reservation of space by the Village shall not
preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility by a
private service provider; provided, however, that said pole or wireless support
structure shall accommodate any future use reserved by the Village. In the
event it is necessary to replace any Village pole or wireless support structure
to accommodate the collocation of a service provider's small cell facility, the
service provider shall pay for the replacement of the Village pole or wireless
support structure.
   (v)   Alternate Location. The Village may propose an alternate location to
the proposed location of a new wireless support structure that is either within
100 feet of the location set forth in a person's application for consent to
occupy or use a public right-of-way, or is within a distance that is equivalent
to the width of the public right-of-way that the new wireless support structure
is proposed to be located on; whichever is greater. Any applicant or service
provider shall be required to use the alternate location proposed by the
Village, if the applicant or service provider has the right to use the
alternate location on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location does not impose technical limits or additional costs.
   (w)   Time for Completion. Any collocation or construction of a new wireless
support structure shall be completed within 180 days after the issuance of a
consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way. The Village and service
provider may extend this completion date by mutual agreement.
   (x)   Underground Placement. No small cell facility or wireless support
structure shall be constructed in a public right-of-way that is located in an
area in which it was required, or will be required under the Village Codified
Ordinances, to install any electric facilities, telephone facilities, or any
other facilities underground. This prohibition shall not apply to the
replacement of a wireless support structure or the collocation of a small cell
facility on a wireless support structure that exists in said designated area. A
service provider may apply to the Planning Commission for a waiver of the
underground placement requirement for the construction of a new wireless
support structure if the service provider is unable to achieve its service
objective under the following circumstances:
      (1)   From a location in the public right-of-way where the prohibition
does not apply;
      (2)   In a utility easement the service provider has the right to access;
or
      (3)   In or on other suitable locations or structures made available by
the Village at reasonable rates, fees, and terms.
   (y)   Municipal Structures. A service provider may collocate a small cell
facility on a wireless support structure owned by the Village and which is
located in the public right-of- way, provided that the person complies with the
applicable design guidelines and conditions for such collocation adopted by the
Village that are consistent with said design guidelines under this chapter. The
Village may condition approval of said collocation on the replacement or
modification of the Village's wireless support structure, at the service
provider's cost, if the Village determines that replacement or modification of
the Village's wireless support structure is necessary. The Village shall retain
ownership of any Village wireless support structure that is replaced. The
Village shall annually charge the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per
each small cell facility collocated on a wireless support structure owner by
the Village and located in the public right-of-way.
(Ord. 2018-51. Passed 8-22-18.)
1048.04   LOCATION, RELOCATION, AND REMOVAL OF SMALL CELL FACILITY AND WIRELESS
SUPPORT STRUCTURE.
   (a)   Excess Capacity. To reduce excavation and congestion in the public
right-of-way, it is the Village's goal to encourage service providers to share
occupancy of utility poles, as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess
available space on utility poles for occupancy of future small cell facilities
in the public right-of-way. The service provider may charge a reasonable market
lease rate to other providers for occupancy of the additional utility pole
space as reimbursement.
   (b)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the Village, a service provider shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of
any small cell facility and wireless support structure in the public right-of-
way whenever the Village shall have determined that such removal, relocation,
change, or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or
installation of any Village or other public improvement in or upon the public
right-of-way.
      (2)   The operations of the Village or other governmental entity in or
upon the public right-of-way.
   (c)   Removal of Unauthorized Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support
Structure. Within thirty days following written notice from the Village, any
service provider or other person that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized small cell facility, wireless support structure, or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove the
small cell facility, wireless support structure, or appurtenances from the
public right-of-way of the Village. After the thirty days have expired, the
Village may remove the small cell facility, wireless support structure, or
appurtenances from the public right-of-way at the other party's expense. A
small cell facility and wireless support structure is unauthorized and subject
to removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider's consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   Upon the abandonment of a small cell facility and wireless support
structure in the public right-of-way of the Village;
      (3)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located, or maintained without
the consent to do so, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (4)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located, or maintained, or any
excavation of a public right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a
required construction permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (5)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located, or maintained, or any
excavation of a public right-of-way was performed, at a location not permitted
pursuant to the Village's consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way or
construction permit.
   (d)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Small Cell Facility and Wireless
Support Structure. The Village retains the right and privilege to cut or move
any facilities, or stop work on any construction, reconstruction, installation,
operation, or excavation, located in the public right-of-way of the Village, as
the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response
to any need to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.
   (e)   Abandoned and Damaged Facilities.
      (1)   A service provider shall provide written notice to the Village of
its intent to discontinue use of any facilities. The notice shall include the
date the use will be discontinued. If facilities are not removed within 365
days from the date the use was discontinued, the facilities shall be considered
a nuisance and the Village may remove the facilities at the expense of the
service provider.
      (2)   In the event the facilities are damaged, the service provider shall
promptly repair the damaged facilities. Damaged facilities shall be repaired no
later than thirty days after obtaining written notice that the facilities are
damaged. If the damaged facilities are not repaired within thirty days, then
the damaged facilities shall be considered a nuisance and the Village may
remove the facilities at the expense of the service provider.
(Ord. 2018-51. Passed 8-22-18.)
1048.05   NOTICE OF WORK, ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, AND EMERGENCY WORK.
   (a)   Notice of Work. Except in case of emergency, as provided in division
(c) of this section, or for routine maintenance as provided in division (b) of
this section, no service provider, or any person acting on the service
provider's behalf, shall commence any work in the public right-of-way of the
Village without ten calendar days advance notice to the Village and obtaining
consent to occupy or use the right-of-way pursuant to Section
1048.02, if required.
   (b)   Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders.
      (1)   A service provider need not obtain a construction permit or notify
the Village prior to or after commencing any routine maintenance or new service
orders that do not include the construction in, or excavation or lane
obstruction of, a public right-of-way or closing of a public street.
      (2)   For routine maintenance and new service orders that require the
service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
two hours, the service provider shall provide the Village with forty-eight
hours advance written notice prior to commencing the routine maintenance or new
service order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic
maintenance and indicating how the service provider shall meet all requirements
of ODOT's Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable governmental
regulations.
   (c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a service provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction or closing of
a public street, the service provider shall notify the Village as promptly as
possible before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required, the
service provider shall notify the Building and Zoning Inspector.
(Ord. 2018-51. Passed 8-22-18.)
1048.06   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Other Village Ordinances. In the event that any provision of this
chapter conflicts with any other provision of the Village's Codified Ordinances
or other ordinances or resolutions of the Village, the more restrictive
provision shall govern.
   (b)   Preemption by State and Federal Laws. Except as may be preempted by
applicable State or Federal law, rates, regulations, and orders, this chapter
shall apply and be controlling over each service provider engaged in the
business of transmitting, supplying, or furnishing of services originating,
passing through, or terminating in the Village.
   (c)   Exemption for Village-Owned or Operated Facilities. Nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to apply the provisions of this chapter to
facilities, micro wireless facilities, or private facilities owned or operated
by the Village or any of its operations.
   (d)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
other portion of this chapter, or its application to any person, is, for any
reason, declared invalid, in whole or in part, by any court or agency of
competent jurisdiction, said decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
(Ord. 2018-51. Passed 8-22-18.)
1048.99   PENALTIES AND OTHER REMEDIES.
   (a)   Penalties. Any person found guilty of violating, disobeying, omitting,
neglecting, or refusing to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. A separate and distinct
offense shall be deemed committed each day on which a violation occurs or
continues.
   (b)   Civil Violations and Forfeiture.
      (1)   In lieu of the criminal penalties set forth above, the Building and
Zoning Inspector may make an initial finding of a civil violation by the
service provider for violating, disobeying, omitting, neglecting or refusing to
comply with any of the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The civil forfeiture shall be in an amount payable to the Village
of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each offense. A separate and distinct offense shall be
deemed committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (3)   An action for civil forfeiture shall be commenced by providing the

and the amount of the penalty that will be assessed against it.
      (4)   The service provider shall have fifteen days subsequent to receipt
of the notice of violation in which to correct the violation before the Village
may assess penalties against the service provider. The time in which to cure
the violation may be extended by the Village if, in the Village's sole
discretion, it determines that additional time is required to correct the
violation; provided that the service provider commences corrective action
within seven days of the notice of violation and proceeds with reasonable
diligence.
      (5)   The service provider may dispute the alleged violation by providing
the Village with written notice within five days of receipt of the notice of
violation, setting forth in reasonable detail the reasons for its dispute. The
Village shall set a date for hearing of the alleged violation before the
Planning Commission no sooner than thirty days and not later than sixty days
from receipt of the notice of dispute.
      (6)   The Village shall issue a written decision on the service
provider's alleged violation within thirty days after the hearing, which
decision shall be final and subject to the administrative appeal procedures
under Ohio law. If the Village finds after hearing that the alleged violation
(s) did occur, the penalty shall be assessed starting fifteen days from the

installation permit only under the following conditions:
      (1)   If the cause for the false alarms was determined to be an equipment
problem, the existing alarm system must be completely removed and an entire new
system must be installed. Removal of the old system must be verified by the
Police Department before a new system is installed.
      (2)   If the cause for the false alarms was determined to be human error,
the permit holder must provide documentation that all persons who could cause
the transmission of a false alarm have received formal training in the proper
operation of the alarm system. This training must be conducted and documented
by the alarm company.
   (p)   Permits may be cancelled by the Chief of Police, with the approval of

of its members, are as provided in Article X of the Municipal Charter. Each
member shall receive compensation in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
per meeting, except the Mayor and the Council member, who shall receive no

fact.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall have all powers conferred upon it by
law, and, in addition thereto:
      (1)   Shall have control of the location of buildings to be erected upon
ground acquired within the limits of the Municipality, and of the height,
structure and general appearance of such buildings in all districts except the
C-1 District. All plans and specifications for the erection thereof shall be
submitted to and approved by the Commission before an application for a
building permit is submitted.
      (2)   For developments proposed in the C-1 Industrial District the
Planning Commission shall consider the proposal pursuant to the authority,
procedures, and criteria set forth in Section

unnecessary hardship. However, no such variance recommendation shall be given
unless the Commission finds that all of the following facts and conditions
exist:
         A.   There are extraordinary circumstances applying to the property
which do not apply generally to other properties;
         B.   The variance is necessary for the preservation of property rights
equal to those of other similar properties in the same zoning district;

recurrent as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation for proper control;
       (8)   Shall grant conditional zoning certificates for the use of
buildings, structures, lots or lands where such certificates for specific uses
are provided for in the Zoning Code;
      (9)   Shall interpret the Zoning Code so as to carry out the intent and
purposes of the Comprehensive Plan in any case where the boundary lines of the
several use districts and the street layout on the ground vary from boundary
lines or street layouts as shown upon the Master District Map;
      (10)   Shall authorize the extension, enlargement or relocation of a
nonconforming use of buildings, structures, lots or lands where such would not
be detrimental to or tend, substantially, to alter the character of the
existing neighborhood;
      (11)   Shall authorize alteration or construction of a building or
structure beyond the building line, subject to such conditions as the
Commission deems advisable and/or reasonable;
      (12)   Shall permit an extension, of not more than twenty-five feet, of a

boundary line of a use district divides a lot or lands owned by the same
person; and
      (13)   Shall determine, upon written application therefor, into which use
district any use not specifically provided for in the Zoning Code may or will
be permitted.

1220.02   REVIEW AUTHORITY, PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA FOR C-1 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   General Development Plan Review Authority. For any proposed
development in the C-l District the applicant shall submit for review by the
Planning Commission a General Development Plan (GDP) and the Planning
Commission shall make a recommendation to Village Council. In recognition of
the unique characteristics of the site and the expected development (with
respect to such factors as: the size and location of the C-l property; the mix
of uses permitted: the unique marketing and development characteristics of
these uses: and the proximity of the District to adjacent single family
residential areas on the south side of the C-1 zoning) the Planning Commission
and Village Council have the authority and responsibility to consider: the
location and appearance of buildings and structures, landscaping, storm water
and sanitary sewer management, parking and circulation, site lighting, and
signs and shall review the general development plan to determine that it
satisfies the standards and purposes set forth in Chapter 1270 and reasonably
satisfies the criteria in Section
1278.11 and Section
1220.02(d).
   (b)   GDP Submission Requirements. The General Development Plan application
shall include plans, illustrations, and supporting documentation for the entire
area of the proposed project which shall include:

public and private streets, driveways, sidewalks, parking and loading areas,
fire lanes, utilities, waste disposal etc.
      (8)   A preliminary landscape, and grading plan depicting: mounding,
fencing, vegetation to be retained: type of new landscaping (shrubs, trees,
ground cover, etc.) and the general spacing and size of new vegetation at the
time of planting;
      (9)   A summary table depicting floor areas for each use, and the traffic
volumes to be generated by time of day.
      (10)   A lighting plan depicting the location of fixtures, the general
direction of the light: the level of brightness (on the ground, in the air, and
along the property lines of Route 8 and the residential to the south); and the
hours for the illumination.
      (11)   A sign plan depicting the size, height, illumination and
anticipated movement of each sign;
      (12)   A preliminary subdivision plat of the proposed development area,
if any, and the manner that the requirements of the platting and Subdivision
Regulations of the Village have been or will be met; and
   (c)   GDP Review Procedures:
      (1)   Review for Completeness. Within ten (10) days after receiving an
application, or an amended application, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall
review the submitted application for compliance with the applicable submission
requirements in Sub-Section (b) above. If the application is deemed
insufficient, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall notify the applicant of
any deficiencies and the additional information needed. When the application is
deemed complete and the application fee has been paid, the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall officially accept the application, or amended application, and
place it on the Planning Commission's agenda or declare the application a Minor
Modification, as permitted by Section 1120.02 (f), if applicable.
      (2)   Distribution of Plans. When the Building and Zoning Inspector
determines that the application for a GDP is complete, the Building and Zoning
Inspector shall forward the application to the appropriate Village departments
and professional consultants for review and comment. Any reports, comments, or
expert opinions shall be returned to the Building and Zoning Inspector and be
available when the Planning Commission considers the application.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review the GDP, or amendment thereto,
according to the applicable criteria in Section
1220.02 (d) and shall make a recommendation to Village Council to:
         A.   Approve the GDP as submitted: or
         B.   Approve the GDP subject to specific, yet reasonable, conditions:
or
         C.   Deny the GDP when the application does not demonstrate that the
standards and criteria have been met.
When reviewing the GDP, the Planning Commission may also postpone the
consideration of the application to a subsequent Planning Commission meeting in
order for the applicant and/or the Commission to address concerns, comments,
alternatives, or conditions expressed at a Planning Commission meeting and
consider anv reasonable requests for additional information that may have been
received.
In reviewing the GDP, the Planning Commission may utilize and rely on outside
consultants to evaluate the proposal and make recommendations to the
Commission. The reasonable cost of this review is to be paid by the applicant.
      (4)   Village Council shall consider the recommendation of the Planning
Commission and shall:
         A.   Approve the GDP as recommended by the Planning Commission;
         B.   Approve the GDP with modified and/or additional conditions; or
         C.   Deny the application when Village Council determines that the

      (5)   Failure of the Planning Commission and Village Council to act on
the GDP, or amendment thereto, within sixty days from the date the application
was deemed complete, or an extended period as may be agreed upon, the applicant
may deem the application denied.
   (d)   Review Criteria. In reviewing the GDP, the Planning Commission and
Village Council shall recognize the unique development that is expected and the
purposes of the C-l District; take into consideration the comments and
recommendation of staff and consultants; and determine that the proposed GDP
complies with the review criteria set forth below:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with the requirements and purposes of the C-
1 District.
      (2)   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to
the proposed development will not suffer a significant negative impact.
      (3)   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property and roadways.
      (4)   The plan provides for an appropriate number of parking spaces based
on the factors set forth in Section
1278.11.
      (5)   The development provides adequate lighting for safe and convenient
use of the streets, walkways, driveways, and parking areas and is designed in a
manner that balances the marketing and development interests of the applicant
with the impact on adjacent areas and considers the impact of direct light,
glare and glow on adjacent property so that the lighting does not unreasonably
interfere with the use and eniovment of adjacent property.
      (6)   The proposed signs are of an appropriate size, scale, and design in
relationship to the unique marketing and development characteristics of the
proposed uses and buildings; are located to maintain safe and orderly
pedestrian and vehicular circulation: and will not unreasonably interfere with
the use and enjoyment of adjacent property.
      (7)   The existing and/or proposed landscaping:
         A.   Enhances the quality of principal buildings, parking lots and
overall site development;
         B.   Maintains existing trees and/or shrubs to the extent possible;
         C.   Adequately buffers adjacent residential uses: and
      (8)   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through
the site in compliance with the applicable storm water regulations and best
engineering practices for storm water drainage.
      (9)   The proposed sanitary sewer svstem for the property is adequate to
serve the needs of the proposed Plan.
      (10)   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
phase shall be so planned that the foregoing criteria are complied with at the
completion of each phase.
   Since the uses proposed are “permitted by right'”' a GDP that meets the
standards, criteria, and purposes of the regulations cannot be unreasonably
denied,
   (e)   Significance of an Approved General Development Plan:
      (1)   An approved GDP shall become for the proposed development a binding
commitment of the specific elements approved for development. The approved GDP
may be transferred to another person, corporation, or group of individuals or
corporations at any time provided that the new ownership complies with all
applicable approvals, stipulations and conditions related to the approved GDP.
      (2)   All subsequent construction and development for each component part
may be approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector when he or she determines
that the intended construction is in accordance with the approved GDP. Any
departure from such approved plan shall be considered pursuant to Sub-Section
(f) below.
   (f)   GDP Modifications after Approval.
      (1)   A minor modification to the approved GDP may be approved by the
Building and Zoning Inspector. A modification shall be considered minor when it
results in:
         A.   A small change(s) to the footprint of the buildings and/or a
change in the floor area allocations for each use or in the general locations
as specified on approved GDP, that does not materially impact parking:
         B.   Changes to signs, lighting, landscaping or parking that are
essentially equivalent to what was included in the previously approved GDP.
         C.   An increase in the height of buildings, when such increased
height complies with the building setbacks and any increase in floor area will
not materially affect the amount of parking available or needed.
      (2)   Any modification to the approved GDP that does not satisfy the
criteria in Section
1220.02 (f)(1) above, shall be considered a plan amendment and shall only be
approved pursuant to the procedures for GDP approval as specified in Section
1220.02(c).
(Ord. 2012-52. Passed 8-8-12.)
1220.03   APPEALS; VARIANCES; CONDITIONAL ZONING PERMITS.
   Any determination by the Building and Zoning Inspector, made in the
enforcement of the Zoning Code, may be appealed in writing to the Planning
Commission by any person deeming himself or herself adversely affected by his
or her decision. The concurring vote of at least two members of the Commission
shall be necessary in order to make a recommendation to Council that the
determination of the Inspector be reversed or modified.
   Upon the recommendation of the Commission, Council shall, at its discretion,
grant a variance from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Inspector. The grant of a variance by the Commission shall be in the form
of a resolution setting forth what the variance is to be, and such resolution
shall be attached to the conditional zoning permit which shall issue therefor.
The resolution shall contain a statement that the Inspector shall certify, in
writing, to the Commission, that all conditions contained in the resolution
have been fully met by the applicant, before an occupancy permit shall issue on
the project involved and the variance or variances granted.

parallel and adjacent to an arterial or collector street, providing access to
abutting properties and protection from arterial or collector streets.

(Reg. 704) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1242.05   VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may recommend for approval and Council may
grant variances to this Title as specified herein where unusual or exceptional
factors or conditions require such modification, provided that the Planning
Commission shall:
      (1)   Determine that the size, shape, location, or surroundings of the
property are unusual; find that unusual topographical or physical conditions,
or other conditions inherent in the land, exist.
      (2)   Determine that a strict compliance with this Title would create an
extraordinary and unnecessary hardship in the face of the exceptional
conditions.
      (3)   Permit any modification to depart from this Title only to the
extent necessary to equitably remove the hardship so that substantial justice
is done.
      (4)   Determine that any modification granted will not be detrimental to
the public interest nor in conflict with the spirit, intent and purpose of this
Title.
      (5)   Require such other conditions to be met by the proposed plat as the
Planning Commission may find necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Title
when modified.
      (6)   Determine that a strict compliance with this Title would deprive
the property of privileges enjoyed by similar property in the vicinity.
   (b)   In making its determinations, the Planning Commission may also
consider:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
      (2)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood will be altered
or whether adjoining properties would be adversely affected as a result of the
variance.
      (3)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
   (c)   If the proposed variance involves the establishment of a cul-de-sac in
excess of the maximum permitted length, the Planning Commission may also
consider the number and size of sublots served by the cul-de-sac and the
availability of central water service to determine if the variance will permit
appropriate development of the land without unduly affecting the public safety;
the Planning Commission may also consider the opinions of local officials.
   (d)   If the proposed variance involves the creation of a sublot whose depth
exceeds four and one-half times its width, the Planning Commission may also
consider the pattern of existing platting for similarly-zoned land in the
vicinity.
   (e)   Council may grant variances affecting required improvements upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission. Such recommendations shall be based
on the findings listed in this section.
(Reg. 705) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)

applicable sections of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Reg. 706) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1242.07   SEPARABILITY.
   If any article, section, paragraph, clause, or part of this Title is held
invalid by a court, such judgment shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions of this Title.
(Reg. 707) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1242.08   REPEAL.
   All prior Subdivision Regulations and amendments thereto are hereby

street or road, is less than five lots after the original tract has been
completely subdivided.
   The proposed division shall not be contrary to applicable zoning regulations
nor this Title. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half times the lot width
or be less than one and one-half times the lot width at the minimum building
setback line unless a variance is granted by the Planning Commission. Also, see
Section
1248.05.
   (b)   Major Subdivisions. Any subdivision that does not meet the
requirements of a minor subdivision and includes the improvement of one or more

condominium property declaration (under the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter
5311.)
(Reg. 303) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1244.04   MINOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Planning Commission Authority. The Planning Commission is the
reviewing authority that reviews and recommends for approval to Council a minor
subdivision. Both Council and the Planning Commission endorse the conveyance of
a parcel or parcels of land in a minor subdivision “Approval for Transfer
without Plat, No Building Site Approved.”
   (b)   Submission of Minor Subdivisions. Any person proposing to create a
minor subdivision shall submit the following to the designated authority:
      (1)   A metes and bounds description signed and sealed by a registered
surveyor accompanied by a plat or plan or survey that meets the minimum

basis of bearing when such monumentation is located within 500 feet of major or
minor subdivision.
      (5)   All properties abutting minor subdivision shall show owner's name
(s), deed or official record number and page number except for sides bordered
by a recorded major subdivision in which case the lot number and the plat or
cabinet number and page number shall be shown.
      (6)   Show and describe monumentation used to establish all existing
property lines.
      (7)   The plat of survey shall be indisputably legible and the acceptable

the proposed property line and said structures shall be referenced within 0.5
feet to the proposed line.
      (10)   A certification within the last six months by the Zoning Inspector
that the proposed minor subdivision is in compliance with the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Action by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Upon review of applicable agencies including, but not limited to
the Planning Commission and Village Engineer and within 30 working days after
submission of a minor subdivision or within a mutually agreed upon extension,
the reviewing authority shall recommend to Council either to approve or
disapprove the application for transfer without a record plat.
      (2)   If the reviewing authority does not approve the transfer, the

1244.05   MAJOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   General Procedure. Major subdivisions shall be approved in four
stages: preliminary discussion stage, preliminary plan stage, improvement plan
stage and final plat stage.
      (1)   The preliminary discussion stage requires the subdivider to discuss
the proposed subdivision so that he/she can become familiar with subdivision
requirements, existing conditions, and future plans. Refer to division (b) of
this section.
      (2)   The preliminary plan stage requires the subdivider to present all
information needed to determine that the proposed layout is satisfactory and
will serve the public interest. Refer to division (c) of this section.
      (3)   The improvement plan stage requires the subdivider to present
engineering improvement plans to the Village Engineer, City of Cleveland Water
Department, NEORSD, and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Sedimentation
pollution controls shall be incorporated as a part of the overall improvement
plan. Improvements shall not be constructed until such time the Village
Engineer, Cleveland Water Department, NEORSD, and the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency have approved the improvement plans.
      (4)   The final plat stage requires the subdivider to present all data
needed to determine that the subdivision fully complies with this Title and
conforms to the approved preliminary plan. After approval of all streets,
highways, or other public ways, or open space by the Planning Commission and
Council, the plat will be transferred and recorded, with required bonds, at the
developer's expense. The developer shall be responsible for getting the plat
recorded.
   (b)   Preliminary Discussion Stage. The subdivider shall consult with the
Planning Department and the Village officials. Subsequently, the subdivider
shall consult with the County Soil and Water Conservation District and Army
Corps of Engineers concerning Wetlands preservation. At this time, no formal
approvals are requested of these individuals and/or their agencies or
departments. The subdivider shall submit a preliminary discussion map including
all items required by Section
1246.02. The preliminary discussion map will be initialed by the Zoning
Inspector (or other designated Village representative).
   (c)   Preliminary Plan Stage Procedure.
      (1)   Submission of Preliminary Plan. The Subdivider shall make
application to the Zoning Inspector for approval of a preliminary plan.
         All information required by Section
1246.03, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission on the preliminary plan
as follows:
         A.   One copy of application (see Appendix A).
         B.   Ten copies of the preliminary plan including a vicinity map.
         C.   Any other data that the Zoning Inspector deems necessary.
         D.   Preliminary Plan fees (see Section
1242.04).
         E.   All plans shall be dated: month, day, year.
      (2)   Transmission of Preliminary Plan. The Zoning Inspector shall
transmit at least one copy of the preliminary plan to the following officials
and agencies for their review and recommendation:
         A.   Planning Commission (5 copies);
         B.   Village Engineer (2 copies);
         C.   County Soil and Water Conservation District (2 copies);
         D.   Staff may transmit additional copies of the preliminary plan
documents to utility companies, school boards, and others as they deem
necessary.
      (3)   Official Filing of Preliminary Plan. Upon determination by the
Zoning Inspector that the preliminary plan has been properly submitted, the
preliminary plan shall be accepted as being officially filed. Official filing
shall take place a minimum of 10 working days prior to the Planning
Commission's regularly scheduled meeting for consideration of major
subdivisions. The Zoning Inspector shall not accept a preliminary plan as being
officially filed if it is missing any of the required information. However,
where it appears to the Zoning Inspector that the subdivider can reasonably
produce the missing information within a short time, the Zoning Inspector may
grant the subdivider up to five additional working days to produce the
additional information. The Planning Commission need not consider a preliminary
plan unless it is officially filed.
      (4)   Information to be Supplied by the Developer upon Filing of
Preliminary Plan.
         A.   Prior to the Planning Commission taking action it is the
responsibility of the developer to submit the following data:
            1.   A copy of the proposed plan which contains a statement
indicating that the proposed development meets all current zoning requirements
of the Village. The plan shall have affixed to it the signature of the Zoning
Inspector indicating that the zoning requirements have been met.
            2.   Additional information deemed necessary by the Zoning
Inspector.
         B.   If the developer requires additional time to acquire the needed
information he or she may do so by submitting a written request to the Zoning
Inspector.
      (5)   Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission shall recommend
to Council to approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the preliminary
plan. The action shall be conveyed in writing to the subdivider and all
reviewing agencies deemed necessary. The action shall also be entered on the
official records of the Planning Commission and a copy of the preliminary plan
and action taken will be kept on file.
      (6)   Effect of Approval. An approved preliminary plan is to be used as a
guide for the preparation of improvement plans and for the preparation of a
subdivision plat for final approval and recording upon fulfillment of all
conditions of preliminary approval and all requirements of this Title. Approval
of a preliminary plan by the Planning Commission and Council shall be effective
for a period of one year following the date of approval unless an extension of
time is granted by the Planning Commission and Council. The preliminary plan
will be valid if the final plat approval has been developed in stages. Upon
expiration of a preliminary plan approval, no approval of a final plat shall be
given until the preliminary plan has been resubmitted and approved.
Construction shall not begin until the improvement plans have been approved by
the Village Engineer, Cleveland Water Department, NEORSD and the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (d)   Improvement Plan.
      (1)   The developer's engineer shall prepare improvement plans which
shall conform to the approved preliminary plan and include all phases of the
work to be performed to make the land suitable for development into the use
proposed. These plans shall be complete and precise in all details. Three
copies shall be submitted to the Village Engineer. A copy shall be marked and
returned to the developer's engineer for corrections if necessary. If found to
be satisfactory, copies of the plans shall be sent to the Cleveland Water
Department, NEORSD and Ohio EPA for their approvals. The original tracing shall
be submitted for approval signature by the Village Engineer.
      (2)   If the developer finds in the process of preparing improvement
plans that the approved preliminary plan is not workable and changes in layout
are required, he or she shall inform the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission may require that a revised preliminary plan be submitted for
reapproval.
   (e)   Final Plat Stage Procedure.
      (1)   Submission of Final Plat.
         A.   The subdivider shall make application to the Planning Commission
for approval of a final plat. The final plat submitted shall conform to the
approved preliminary plan. Subdivisions may be submitted for final approval in
phases provided that preliminary and sedimentation pollution control plan
approval has been given for the entire subdivision.
         B.   All items as required by Section
1246.05 shall be submitted to the Planning Commission as follows:
            1.   Eight copies of final plat and vicinity map. Additional copies
may be required by the Planning Department if necessary.
            2.   Final plat fees as set forth in Section
1242.04.
            3.   Where a park, playground, school site, or other public space
shown on the final plat is to be dedicated to the public, the subdivider shall
submit a signed warranty deed for the parcel(s) along with the final plat. This
deed shall be considered part of the final plat for approval and recording
purposes.
      (2)   Official Filing of Final Plat. The Zoning Inspector shall present
to the Planning Commission the final plat documents which meet the requirements
of Section
1246.05, at the next meeting after all required documents have been submitted.
The final plat shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector at least ten working
days prior to consideration by the Planning Commission at their regularly
scheduled meeting. Upon determination by the Planning Commission that the final
plat has been properly submitted, the Planning Commission shall recommend to
Council to accept the final plat as being officially filed and certify on the
copies the date.
      (3)   Planning Commission Action.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall act within 60 calendar days
following the official filing of the final plat. If no action is taken during
this time period, the final plat shall be deemed to have been recommended for
Council approval by the Planning Commission.
         B.   One of the following actions shall be taken by the Planning
Commission.
            1.   Recommend Final Approval by Council. The Planning Commission
may recommend final approval by Council before all required improvements are
installed, authorizing its Chairperson, or any other officer of the Planning
Commission, to indicate such recommendation for approval and date on the
tracing of the final plat. Notwithstanding, the provisions of Section
1250.01(g)(7), where it appears that the requirements of Section
1250.01(g)(7) will be met prior to the Planning Commission's next scheduled
meeting, the Planning Commission may, with the consent of the subdivider, give
final recommendation for approval effective upon the Village Engineer's future
approval of the improvement plans and signing the plat. Such final
recommendation for approval shall take effect as of the date of the Village
Engineer's signature. If the requirements of Section
1250.01(g)(7) have not been met by the Planning Commission's next scheduled
meeting the final plat shall automatically be placed on the agenda for the next
Planning Commission meeting, at which the Planning Commission may reaffirm,
modify, or change its previous action.
            2.   Recommend Disapproval by Council. Should the Planning
Commission recommend to Council to disapprove the final plat, written notice of
such action, including reference to the section or sections of this Title not
complied with by the plat, shall be mailed to the subdivider and his or her
engineer and/or surveyor. The action shall also be entered on the official
records of the Planning Commission. This criteria extends to all owners and/or
partners listed on the dedication plat of said previous phase of subdivision.
            3.   Recommend Approval by Council without Planning Commission
Action. In the event the Planning Commission fails to act upon the final plat
within 60 calendar days of the date of its official filing, or within a time
extension mutually agreed upon between the Developer and the Planning
Commission, the final plat shall be deemed to have been recommended for
approval by the Planning Commission to Council.
         C.   Effect of Approval. Final approval of a plat by the Planning
Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication
of any street, highway, or other public ways, or open space upon the plat until
such acceptance is also endorsed by Council upon the tracing of the final plat.
Planning Commission final recommendation for approval shall automatically
expire if the final plat is not presented to Council for final approval within
two years of the Planning Commission's preliminary plan approval.
      (4)   Council's Action. Council shall act within 30 calendar days from
the date of the official filing of the plat with Council.

1248.01   PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Flood Hazards. If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to flooding or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to such
problems in the design of the subdivision. Land subject to flooding and land
otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for
such other uses that may increase danger to health, life, or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard as delineated by detailed engineering studies.
(Reg. 501) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1248.02   STREETS.
   (a)   Arrangement.
      (1)   Proposed streets and public access to adjacent unplatted lands
shall be designed so that the entire area can be served with a coordinated
public street system.
      (2)   All streets must be designed and constructed to the Village
Engineer's standards. The width of rights-of-way should be provided so that all
underground utilities can be located outside of pavement areas.
   (b)   Street Classification.
      (1)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation of
movement of traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from one
section of the community to another. They shall contain as few intersections
with minor streets as possible.
      (2)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. The
street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets shall be in
general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the
entire neighborhood. The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the
tract to be recorded unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such
extension is not necessary nor desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets or
cul-de-sacs will be approved only when necessitated by topography or other
physical conditions or where they are appropriate for the type of development
contemplated.
   (c)   Public and Private Street Right-of-Way Widths and Grades.

remaining half of the street shall be platted.
   (e)   Cul-de-Sac and Dead-End Streets.
      (1)   A street designed to be permanent cul-de-sac, which contains
central water service and fire hydrants for its full length, may serve up to 25
sublots; otherwise a permanent cul-de-sac shall not be longer than 1,000 feet.
Permanent cul-de-sacs shall be provided at the closed end with a paved
turnaround having an outside pavement radius of at least 47.5 feet and a street
right-of-way line radius of at least 60 feet ,or such greater dimension agreed
upon by the developer and the Village Engineer.
      (2)   If a cul-de-sac is of a temporary nature and a future extension
into adjacent land is anticipated, then the turning circle beyond the normal
street width shall be in the nature of an easement. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners when the dead-end street is
legally extended into adjacent land. If such dead-end street extends only the
depth of the corner lot past a street intersection, no turnaround will be
required. Subdividers shall be required to provide a two foot reservation strip
in the name of the Village at the end of all dead-end streets. This strip will
become public highway only upon extension of the dedicated street. The
developer extending the street will be responsible for removing the temporary
portions of the cul-de-sac, regrading, seeding, etc.
   (f)   Corner Radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of not less than 20 feet, or as required by the Village Engineer.
   (g)   Horizontal Curves. Angles in the alignment of street lines shall be
connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not less than 300 feet
for local streets, 800 feet for collector and industrial streets, and 1,200
feet for major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves there shall be a
tangent at least 100 feet long on major arterial thoroughfares.
   (h)   Intersections. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than 70 degrees. In no event shall an intersection containing
streets in excess of four legs be considered unless specifically approved by
the Planning Commission and the Village Engineer. There shall be a minimum
separation of 300 feet between intersections.
   (i)   Street Centerline Offsets (Jogs). Street jogs with centerline offsets
shall be prohibited unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission and
the Village Engineer.

   (a)   Generally. Adequate easements along rear or side lot lines shall be
provided for utilities and drainage where necessary. A 12 foot easement on each
front lot line for utilities is required.
   (b)   Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
way, a storm sewer or drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines
of such drainage way shall be provided. The easement shall be a minimum of 20
feet or as the Village Engineer and Planning Commission may require.
   (c)   Utility Lines. All utility lines shall be located underground.
(Reg. 503) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)

width as deemed necessary by the Planning Department shall be required across
streets where the Planning Commission and the Village Engineer determines that
pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation,
and other community facilities is necessary.
      (2)   Paving, fencing, and other improvements may be required by the
Planning Commission.
   (c)   Commercial or Industrial Blocks. Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses,
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
(Reg. 504) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1248.05   LOTS.
   (a)   Zoning Conformance. The lot size, width, depth, and the minimum
building setback lines shall meet, as a minimum, the existing Zoning
Regulations.
   (b)   Access to Public Streets. The subdividing of land ,whether as major or
minor subdivision, shall provide each lot with 60 feet of continuous frontage
on a dedicated street. This standard may be reduced by the Planning Commission
for lots fronting on a permanent cul-de-sac.
   (c)   Double-Frontage Lot. Lots shall be laid out so that there are no
double-frontages except:
      (1)   Where extreme conditions in elevation prevent access to the lot
from one of the streets; or
      (2)   Where it is necessary to separate residential lots from major
arterial thoroughfares.
   (d)   Lot Lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines. Lot lines should follow municipal and county boundary lines
rather than cross them.
   (e)   Lot Depth. No lot depth shall exceed four and one-half times the lot
width unless granted a variance by the Planning Commission. The lot width shall
be measured at the minimum building setback line. This provision also applies
to Section

groves of trees.
(Reg. 506) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1248.07   SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING.
   The developer is required to make adequate provisions for the screening of
the development from surrounding residential properties by landscaping.
Consideration shall also be given to minimizing the removal of trees. The
developer is required to submit for approval a landscaping plan which will show
landscaping that is adequate to screen the development from surrounding
residential properties. A performance bond in an amount adequate to cover the
cost of landscaping required by the approved landscaping plan shall be
deposited with the Municipality to assure the faithful performance and
installation of any required landscaping. The bond must be issued by a
recognized and approved bonding company and shall be for a period commensurate
with the completion of the landscaping plan. Should an occupancy permit or
permits be issued prior to the completion of the landscaping plan, then the
performance bond shall be renewed for that period of time that will assure
faithful compliance with the approved landscaping plan.

Engineer. There shall be a minimum separation of 300 feet between
intersections.
         C.   Vertical Alignment. Simple parabolic vertical curves shall be
used to effect a gradual change between tangent grades where the algebraic
difference of grades in percent is greater than 0.50.
         D.   Horizontal Alignment. Angles in the alignment of street
centerlines shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 300
feet for local streets, 800 feet for collector and industrial streets, and
1,200 feet for major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves there shall
be a tangent distance of 100 feet except for local streets.
         E.   Boulevards and Roadway Islands. Boulevards and Roadway Islands
shall meet Village Engineer approval.
         F.   Cul-de-Sacs. Streets terminating in a permanent circular
turnaround shall have a minimum right-of-way line radius of 60 feet. The outer
edge of pavement shall have a minimum radius of 47½ feet. Cul-de-sacs with an
island in the middle shall be property drained, and shall meet Village
approval.
         G.   Temporary Turnarounds. Interior streets terminating at the
allotment boundary and subject to possible future extension shall be provided
with a temporary turnaround. The turnaround shall be in the nature of a turning
circle constructed on a temporary easement over the premises included in said
turning circle, but beyond the right-of-way boundaries of the street proper and
shall cease to exist and shall be eliminated when said street is legally
extended by dedication. The easement shall be of sufficient dimensions to
include the turning circle and all ditches, drains, and pipes required to drain
the turnaround properly. The easement must be shown on the record plat and the
improvement plans as required by the Village Engineer. The construction of a
temporary turnaround shall be the same specifications as permanent pavement
unless the Village agrees to the modification. The developer that extends the
street is required to remove the temporary turnaround and restore the disturbed
property.
         H.   Curbs. Curbs shall conform to a typical drawing as approved by
the Village Engineer. In addition, a ramp with nonslip surface shall be built
into the curb at each pedestrian crosswalk so that the sidewalk and street
blend to a common level. Such ramps shall be constructed in accordance with the
State of Ohio Department of Transportation Standards insofar as feasible.
         I.   Sidewalks.
            1.   One course cement sidewalks, four feet wide and four inches
thick, six inches thick at drives, shall be constructed of Class “C” concrete

the County Engineer, a bond may be required, and the County Engineer
specifications must be met.
            2.   Along Village streets: approval and/or permits are required
from the Village. A bond may be required, and Village specifications must be
met.
      (3)   Drainage Design.
         A.   Generally.
            1.   No subdivision will be approved unless there is an outlet for
all storm water. Provisions shall be made to accommodate effectively the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. It may be necessary to direct surface water to a drainage ditch,
stream, or an existing storm system which has the capacity to carry the flow.
No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings, or
structures shall be placed in, on, or over it unless provision is made for the
flow of water in a manner satisfactory to the Village Engineer. An easement
shall be provided on both sides of an existing improvement surface drainage
course for the purpose of maintaining, protecting, widening, deepening,
enclosing, or otherwise improving such stream for drainage purpose.
            2.   If the same is across private property, right-of-way or
easements must be obtained by the subdivider or developer. These rights-of-way
or easements must be obtained by the subdivider or developer in the name of the
Village as approved by the Village. These rights-of-way or easements should be
shown on the plat and construction plans. A copy of the recorded easement shall
be furnished to the Village Engineer.
            3.   Storm sewer laterals will be provided as directed by the
Village Engineer for each house on a street having curb.
         B.   Drainage System Requirements. The design criteria for the
drainage system shall be based on the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation Design policy and the criteria as established by the Village
Engineer's Office. This criteria shall apply to development along existing
roads as well as those requiring new roads to be constructed. This criteria
shall be available upon request from the Village Engineer's Office.
            1.   Road Drainage System. The road storm drainage system shall
serve as the local drainage system. It shall be designed to carry roadway,
adjacent land, and house storm water drainage. To prevent excessive pipe sizes,
storm sewers shall drain into natural waterways as soon as possible. All storm
sewer systems shall be designed for a minimum ten-year storm frequency.
            2.   Off-Road Drainage System. The design of the off- road drainage
system shall include the watershed affecting the allotment and shall be
extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
         C.   Stormwater Management Requirements.
            1.   The design and construction of stormwater management
facilities shall require the review and approval of the Village Engineer in
accordance with the technical criteria described in the Village's Stormwater
Management Program Guidelines. Allowable types of stormwater management
facilities include but are not limited to:
               a.   Retention ponds;
               b.   Detention basins; and
               c.   Underground storage tanks.
            2.   All project sites or development areas required to implement
stormwater management practices and facilities shall, at a minimum, limit the
peak rate of discharge from the project site or development area to the
downstream receiving water course as follows:
               a.   Stormwater management measures shall be required to
maintain the post-development peak discharge at a level equal to or less than
the predevelopment peak discharge rate for the 24-hour duration, 1, 2, 5, 10,
25, 50 and 100-year frequency storm events, and:
               b.   Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to
control the volume, timing and rate of flows.
            3.   Velocity reduction devices must be placed at all outlet
points, where necessary, to provide a non-erosive flow velocity to the
receiving water course. The Village Engineer may waive these requirements if
the characteristics of the receiving water course, project site, or development
area are such that this type of control would be contrary to accepted
engineering practice or detrimental to the environment.
         D.   Wetlands. Wetlands will be identified on the Improvement
drawings. If they are going to be changed in any manner, the developer is
responsible for contacting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Summit Soil
and Water Conservation District has a copy of the Wetland Resource Maps for
Summit County. The Summit Soil and Water Conservation District will point out
such wetlands in their review of the preliminary plan. If a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers permit is required, the permit number shall be shown on the final
plat.
      (4)   Drainage System Design and Protection.
         A.   Flood Hazard. If any portion of the land within the subdivision
is subject to flooding (sewer overflow, elevations, etc.) or other hazards, due
consideration shall be given to such problems in the design of the subdivision
and the flood plain must be shown on the improvement plans and plat.
         B.   Dams or Basins Embankments. Three copies of detailed drawings of
proposed dams or basins and all calculations shall be submitted to the Village
Engineer for approval. The developer or his engineer shall apply for a permit
from the State of Ohio, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, if
applicable, and any other applicable agencies.
         C.   Protection of Drainage Systems.
            1.   The subdivider shall adequately protect all ditches (roadways
and watercourses) to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer as shown by
calculations made in accordance with the policy of the State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation and the subdivision drainage criteria of the
Village Engineer.
            2.   In all cases, any drainage facilities within the subdivision
shall be in a stable condition, free from either erosion or sedimentation and/
or other debris. Any damage resulting from erosion, scour, silting of drainage
ways, or blockage of storm drainage systems on and off the development caused
by the construction shall be corrected at the developer's expense.
         D.   Drainage Outlets. Where the Village Engineer finds it necessary
to clean, alter, or reconstruct a natural drainage course or storm sewer system
outside the development boundary to provide a storm water outlet, or to prevent
damage to other properties due to an increased or accelerated flow, the outlet
shall be provided and constructed at the expense of the developer and in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Village Engineer.
         E.   Drainage Drawings. The developer's engineer shall make a complete
study of the drainage area contributing to the allotment. He or she will then
prepare a plan of the entire allotment showing the following:
            1.   Existing and proposed contours at two foot intervals.
            2.   Proposed streets and lots.
            3.   Proposed drainage system showing the area contributing to each
pipe or drainage structure.
      (5)   Bridges. Any bridge, being by definition a structure of greater
than a ten-foot span, shall be designed in accordance with the latest Design
Regulations as practiced in the ODOT Bureau of Bridges and approved by the
Village Engineer. Reference shall also be made to current ODOT Standard Bridge
Drawings. Design flood elevations shall be indicated on plan-profile sheets and
on structure site plans.
      (6)   Supplementary Plan and Information.
         A.   Soil Study.
            1.   During the site viewing, the Summit Soil and Water
Conservation District will provide general soil conditions for the proposed
development.
            2.   The Village Engineer reserves the right to require a soil
study where, in his or her opinion, the existing soil conditions are below
average, and may also require adjustments in design to compensate for the
existing conditions.
         B.   Erosion and Sedimentation Control. When the developer intends to
remove or disturb the natural topsoil, trees, and other vegetation, or where
the developer intends to change the surface contour of a proposed subdivision,
he or she shall prepare an Erosion Control Plan (ECP), and have such plan
approved by the Summit Soil and Water Conservation District. The ECP shall be
included in the improvement drawings. In general, erosion and sedimentation
control work will consist of, but not be limited to grading, soil preparation,
fertilizing, seeding and mulching as necessary to establish a sufficient growth
of grass or other ground cover that minimizes damage to subdivision areas and
to adjoining properties. The Village Engineer and the Summit Soil and Water
Conservation District will have the work inspected to the extent they
determines necessary to insure that the developer has complied with the
approved plans.
         C.   Oversize and/or Off-site Improvements.
            1.   Oversize and/or off-site extensions of utilities, pavements,
and other improvements shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the
orderly development of nearby land which is an integral part of the
neighborhood service or drainage area.
            2.   Where the Village Engineer determines that improvements in
excess of the size needed to serve the proposed subdivision are necessary, the
subdivider shall install improvements required to serve his or her subdivision
plus the additional oversize and/or off-site improvements required.
      (7)   Approvals. All necessary improvement plans for proposed roads,
storm sewers, drainage facilities, sanitary sewers, pump stations, and water
mains shall also be approved by the Village Engineer. In addition, all
improvement plans for sanitary sewer and water supply systems shall be approved
by the NEORSD, City of Cleveland Water Department and Ohio EPA prior to
approval of the final plat by the Village Engineer.
(Reg. 601) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1250.02   ESTIMATED COST.
   Upon approval by the Village Engineer of the construction drawings and
before starting any construction work, the developer's engineer shall prepare
and submit to the Village Engineer an independent estimate of costs by item for
construction surveying; construction engineering; construction of roads, storm
and sanitary sewers, sanitary treatment plans, pumping stations and water
supply systems; drainage structures; erosion control; restoration of land and
site cleanup; and other related items. The total estimated cost, including
labor, shall be prepared and signed by the developer's engineer. The Village
Engineer may add to the developer's estimate an amount to cover contingencies,
including inspection costs, to arrive at the total estimated cost.
(Reg. 602) (Ord. 2000-27. Passed 3-22-00.)
1250.03   BONDS.
   (a)   Generally. Before recording any subdivision plat, the developer shall
furnish to the Finance Director bonds as required by the Village. If the
construction of the subdivision improvements is complete, maintenance bonds are
required; otherwise performance bonds are required.
   (b)   Performance Bonds.
      (1)   Before the recording of any plat of any subdivision, the developer
shall furnish performance bonds to the Finance Director in the amount equal to
100 percent of the approved total cost of the improvements not yet completed
plus ten percent of the cost of the completed items.
      (2)   The performance bond will remain in effect until released by the
Finance Director. In lieu of a surety bond, the developer may deposit a fund
equal to 100 percent of the performance bond in an escrow account with a bank
approved by the Finance Director. The developer and the bank shall inform the
Finance Director in writing that such money is secured and deposited in the
bank for the improvements.
      (3)   The developer's engineer shall verify all invoices and statements
of expenditures and submit copies of them to the Village Engineer.
      (4)   The withdrawal of funds from the escrow account shall not exceed 90
percent of the total estimated costs until the performance bond is released and
the maintenance bond is in effect. The Village Engineer may elect to release a
portion of the performance bond and accept the maintenance bond prior to the
completion of the project should weather or the time of year prevent immediate
completion. In this case the performance bond shall remain in effect and funds
shall be retained in the escrow account to cover the uncompleted items.
      (5)   If the developer fails to proceed with the project within 18 months
of the date the performance bonds are filed, and the Village Engineer, deems it
necessary to notify the Finance Director that the developer has failed in his
or her duty to complete the project, the Finance Director will notify the
developer and the bank in writing of such failure and of the Village's
intention to vacate the subdivision or to complete the project.
   (c)   Maintenance Bonds.
      (1)   Before the Village Engineer will recommend the acceptance of the
subdivision roads or release any performance bond, the developer shall provide
a maintenance bond or cash to the Village Finance Director in the amount of 25%
of the certified construction costs of the roadways and 10% of the certified
construction cost of the sewers and water mains.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may increase the required maintenance bond
above the specified amounts if, in his or her opinion, unusual topographic,
subsoil, or other construction limitations so warrant; however, in such
situations, the Village Engineer shall furnish written explanations to Council
for such action. These maintenance bonds will guarantee that the developer will
maintain the road and related improvements for three years, and that the
developer will restore the road and related improvements if determined
necessary by the Village Engineer. If the developer fails to perform the
maintenance and restoration items, the Finance Director will authorize the
Village Engineer to have the work performed. The cost of this work will be
deducted from the money on deposit as the maintenance bond for that work. The
developer will be held liable for any expenditures over and above the
maintenance bonds. After all maintenance and restoration work has been
completed to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, the Finance Director
will release the maintenance bonds, or those portions remaining, to the
developer. It is the responsibility of the developer to request inspection for
bond release. The bonds will remain in effect until formally released by the
Village Finance Director.

1252.01   PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams and other natural watercourses within the Village of Northfield
contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this Riparian and Wetland Setback Chapter is to
protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the Village and to
protect residents of the Village from property loss and damage because of
flooding and other impacts of the stream. The method of implementing this
chapter is by regulating uses and developments within riparian and wetland
setbacks that would impair the ability of the riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in the stabilization of the banks of streams to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter
streams.
      (5)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
      (7)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland
vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the Village economically by minimizing encroachment on
stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as
dams, retention basins, and rip-rap to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and to the environment of the Village, and thereby preserving
the quality of life of the residents of the Village and corresponding property
values.
      (9)   Protect the safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services of
riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a wetland and/or riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the Village.
(Ord. 2007-70. Passed 12-12-07.)

any lands in violation of these regulations or in violation of any permit
granted under these regulations.
   (g)   Any person or organization who violates Section
1252.08 shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be subject to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for
each offense and shall be required to restore the riparian and wetland setbacks
through a plan approved by the Village Engineer.
   (h)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (i)   Upon notice from the Village that work is being performed contrary to
these regulations, such work shall immediately stop. Such notice shall be in
writing and shall be given to the owner or person responsible for the
development area, or person performing the work, and shall state the conditions
under which such work may be resumed; provided, however, in instances where
immediate action is deemed necessary for pubic safety or the public interest,
the Village may require that work be stopped upon verbal order pending issuance
of the written order.
   (j)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Village, by or through its Law Director, from instituting an
appropriate action or proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent
an unlawful development or to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to
require compliance with the provisions of this regulation or other applicable
laws, or ordinances, rules or regulations.
   (k)   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced through civil
proceedings brought by the Village of Northfield Prosecutor on behalf of the
Village of Northfield.

maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (e)   Failure of the Village to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the owner from
the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall
not result in the Village, its officers, employees, or agents being responsible
for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
   (f)   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor
compliance with the provisions of these regulations shall relieve any person or
entity from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is
otherwise imposed by law.

   (d)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems, and stream culverts.
   (e)   The following shall apply to the riparian and wetland setback:
      (1)   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular
and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water mark of each
designated watercourse and defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state and shall be
established and marked in the field prior to any soil-disturbing or land-
clearing activities.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian and wetland
setback on either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian and
wetland setback shall be extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain.
The 100-year floodplain shall be determined from FEMA floodplain maps.
      (4)   Because the gradient of the riparian and wetland corridor
significantly influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for
steep slopes will be integrated into the riparian and wetland setback formulae
for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% - 20%             Add 25 feet
21% - 25%             Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
   Average streambank slope is to be calculated using methodology outlined in
the Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release
Number 55 (TR-55) by USDA, MRCS.
      (5)   Where wetlands protected under Federal or State law are identified
within the riparian setback, the minimum riparian setback width shall be
extended to the outer boundary of the wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be
protected to the extent detailed in these regulations.
      (6)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. If conflicts exist between the delineation protocols of these
agencies, the delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of
wetland shall apply. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest
version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at
the time of application of the regulations.
      (7)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the riparian and
wetland setbacks, including any expansions or modifications as required by
divisions (b) through (d) of this section, and identifying the setbacks on all
subdivisions, property/parcel splits, land development plans, and/or building
permit applications submitted to the Village. This delineation on all plans
that are required shall be done at the time of application for the review of
the preliminary plans, or at the time of submission of any building permit
applications. The delineation may be done by a metes and bounds, or higher
level, survey. This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the
Village.
      (8)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity, the riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be clearly delineated with temporary construction fencing or
other suitable material by the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be
maintained throughout soil-disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be
maintained in an undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these
regulations. All temporary fencing shall be removed when a development project
is completed.
      (9)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Village prior to on-
site delineation of the riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these
regulations.
      (10)   Prior to obtaining approval for any new subdivision, property/
parcel split, land development or other improvement, the riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records of the Village.
(Ord. 2007-70. Passed 12-12-07.)
1252.06   ESTABLISHMENT OF WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   Wetland setbacks are established as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 120 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA
Category 3 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
      (2)   A minimum of 75 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA
Category 2 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (b)   Procedure for Wetland Setbacks.
      (1)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use:
         A.   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map and the Summit County Wetlands Inventory in the
Cuyahoga River Watershed map (if applicable). A photocopy of the applicable
section of each map will be attached to the permit application.
         B.   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the Village to believe that an unmapped wetland exists on or within
120 feet of the project site, the applicant will retain a qualified wetland
professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or wetland
buffer areas. If no wetland or wetland buffer areas are found, the applicant
shall submit a letter from the qualified wetland professional with the
preliminary plat or permit application verifying their negative findings.
      (2)   New residential or commercial or other type development and
projects involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change. Upon
filing a request for approval of a preliminary plat or building permit for new
residential, commercial, or other type of development that involves changes in
any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant or their designated
representative shall retain a qualified wetland professional to survey the
proposed development site for wetlands. If no wetlands are found, the applicant
or their designated representative shall submit a letter with the preliminary
plat or permit application verifying that a qualified wetland professional has
surveyed the site and found no wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following
procedures shall be followed:
         A.   A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the Village
Engineer, shall determine the presences of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 Wetlands
(or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed development
site using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for Wetland
Evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation. Acceptance
of this determination shall be subject to approval by the Village Engineer.
         B.   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 Wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are on the proposed development site, the applicant or
their designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the wetland
setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or their
designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property/parcel split plans, land development plans,
and/or permit applications submitted to the Village.
            1.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
Village Engineer, using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of the application of this
regulation. If conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two
agencies, the delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of
wetland shall apply.
            2.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and
bounds, or higher level survey subject to the approval by the Village Engineer.
         C.   Prior to any soil or vegetation-disturbing activity, the
applicant or their designated representative shall delineate wetland setbacks
on the development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed, and such
delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
         D.   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Village prior to
delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
      (3)   Upon completion of an approved property/parcel split, commercial
development or other land development or improvement, riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the Village and
shall be maintained as open space thereafter through a permanent conservation
easement. A third party, not the landowner or permittee of the Village, that is
allowed by State law, shall be given the conservation easement. If no third
party will accept the conservation easement, the Village may accept it and
protect it in perpetuity.
(Ord. 2007-70. Passed 12-12-07.)
1252.07   USES PERMITTED.
   (a)   The following uses are permitted by right without a permit within the
riparian and wetland setbacks.
      (1)   Open space uses that are passive in character shall be permitted in
the riparian and wetland setback, including but not limited to those listed in
(a)(1)A. through D. of this section. No use permitted under these regulations
shall be construed as allowing trespass on privately-held lands.
      (2)   Alteration of this natural area is strictly limited. Except as
otherwise provided in these regulations, the riparian and wetland setback shall
be preserved in its natural state.
         A.   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
Federal, State, and local laws, such as hiking, non-motorized bicycling,
fishing, hunting, picnicking and similar uses and associated structures,
including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas.
         B.   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees
may be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than six inches in diameter, shall be anchored to the shore or
removed from the 100-year floodplain.
         C.   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the riparian and wetland setback with non-invasive plant
species shall be allowed without approval of the Village.
         D.   Maintenance of lawns, gardens and landscaping. Lawns, gardens and
landscaping that existed at the time this chapter passed may be maintained, as
long as they are not increased in size.
   (b)   The following uses are permitted by right within the riparian and
wetland setbacks with prior approval of the design by the Village.
      (1)   Stream bank stabilization/erosion control measures. Best management
practices (BMPs) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control may be
allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, State, and
Federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and emphasize
the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical and
available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall only
be undertaken upon approval of a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the
Village.
      (2)   Crossings. In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the Village may
confer with the Summit SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division
of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface
Water; the County of Summit Engineer; the Department of Environmental Services
of Summit County; the Summit County Health Department; or other technical
experts as necessary.
         A.   Limited crossings of designated streams through the riparian and
wetland setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sanitary sewer and/or water lines,
and public utility lines will be per the approval of local, County, and State
governing agencies and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
Sewer, water lines, and utility crossings will require a permit from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineering and/or Ohio EPA.
         B.   One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be
permitted.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the Village's design standards. If more than two crossings
per 1,000 linear feet of stream center is required for these areas, the
applicant must apply for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian and wetland setback and shall
mitigate any necessary disturbances.
         E.   Erosive material shall not be used in making stream crossings.
      (3)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the riparian and wetland setback if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
State standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at least 25
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
      (4)   Selective harvesting of timber. Selective harvesting of timber may
be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a qualified forester and accepted by the Village Engineer.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a five
thousand dollar ($5,000.00) performance guarantee with the Village. This
performance guarantee shall be in the form of a security bond, escrow account,
certified check or cash, and it shall be held until completion of the timber
harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than six inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into sections no longer
than six feet or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Harvested trees or
felled logs and branches that are part of a designed and approved Streambank
Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to remain in a
designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. “Adequately stocked” shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B-Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the Village for the forest
to be harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
high water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees and fire
wood from riparian and wetland and wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            5.   Specify the erosion control best management practices that
will be employed during and after the proposed harvest. These erosion control
practices shall be in conformance with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Forestry's BMPs for Erosion Control on Logging Jobs in
Ohio.
            6.   Provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers and the associated permit
requirements.

are not limited to: landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling
facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction operations,
and road salt storage barns.
   (f)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical and scientific evidence.
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the applicant and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
      (5)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and wetland and/
or wetland setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize

1253.01   PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of storm water
management and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and wetlands, and will promote and
maintain the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Village of
Northfield.
   (b)   This regulation will:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and
wetlands that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil-disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed, storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground water recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
sources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes, including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection and encourage such practices that
promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)   This regulation applies to all parcels used or being developed, either
wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways,
underground cables, or pipelines; subdivisions or larger common plans of
development; industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential projects;
building activities on farms; redevelopment activities; general clearing; and
all other uses that are not specifically exempted in division (d) of this
section.

1253.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe, for each major construction activity, the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls, and Contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The time frame for SWP3 implementation shall be consistent with
the current Ohio EPA NPDES Construction Permit. No project subject to this
regulation shall commence without an SWP3 approval by the Summit SWCD. No
project subject to this regulation shall commence without a pre-construction
meeting held with the Summit SWCD. It will be the applicant's responsibility to
contact the SWCD. The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors
not otherwise defined as “operators” as defined in the Ohio EPA's NPDES Permit,
who will be involved in the implementation of the SWP3, of the terms and
conditions of the SWP3. The applicant shall maintain a written document
containing the signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the
implementation of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and
understand the conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written
document shall be created and signatures shall be obtained prior to
commencement of work on the construction site. A copy shall be provided to the
Summit SWCD prior to commencing with the project. All projects regardless of
the area of disturbance must utilize BMPs to minimize erosion and off site
sedimentation. The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization of denuded areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized
as specified in Tables 1 and 2 below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm
Water Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive.

winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
      (3)   Pre-winter stabilization. If the development area will or is
planned to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the
development area shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting. The meeting
will be held before November 1. The owner shall invite the operator, developer,
engineer, contractor, Village Engineer and anyone else requested by the Village
Engineer to the meeting.
   (b)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (c)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth-disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the upslope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds.
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff from drainage areas
that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet protection, as
determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment settling pond or
equivalent best management practice upon approval from the Village Engineer
and/or the Summit SWCD.
         B.   The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67
cubic yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When
determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling
pond must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length
for each one unit of width (> 2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been
reduced by 40%. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half
of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must
consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination
of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to ten acres. This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers
designed to control sheet flow runoff.

0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but <50%
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   1.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
            2.   Based on site conditions, the Village Engineer and/or the
Summit SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off-
site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include: silt fence or
construction fence installed around the perimeter of the development area to
ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated construction entrances.
         C.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with division (f) of this section.
         D.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer and/or the Summit
SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource or
wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (d)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls. No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials. A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck washout. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (e)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (f)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment- settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (g)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one- half inch of rain per 24-hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required. “Qualified
inspection personnel” are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls. These
inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for one year following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
noncompliance determined by these inspections.
   (h)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all upslope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer. When inspections reveal
the need for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and sediment
control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (i)   Final Stabilzation. All soil-disturbing activities are complete and a
uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% coverage for the area
has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent
structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control practices
have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.

water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly sized BMPs. The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQV) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in O.A.C. Chapter 3745-1. The WQV shall be equivalent to the volume
of runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of
the two following methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-
term hourly precipitation records; or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C * P * A / 12
               where:
                  WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than one
inch (see Table 1)
                  P = 0.75-inch precipitation depth
                  A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
 
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial and commercial                          0.8
High density residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium density residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low density residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open space and recreational areas                  0.2
 
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is low density
residential, 30% is high density residential, and 10% is open space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows: (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQV shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual, ODOT Post-Construction Storm
Water Standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
         F.   BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below.

Media filtration, bioretention              40 hours
*   Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQv
         G.   The owner may request approval from the Village of Northfield
Engineer to use alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can
demonstrate, in a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations,
that the alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in
Table 2 above. The use of alternative or vender supplied post-construction BMPs
should be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided
that the traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically
infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQV is provided within an existing structural
post- construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural post-construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan.
         I.   For redevelopment projects, such as developments on previously
developed property, post-construction practices shall either ensure a 20% net
reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20% of
the WQv, or a combination of the two.
         J.   Site description.
            1.   The prior land uses of the site.

systems, including on-site and off-site treatment/storage facilities that are
constructed by the owner, will be continuously maintained in perpetuity.
   (a)   Detail drawings and maintenance plans must be provided for all post-
construction best management practices (BMPs).
   (b)   Maintenance plans must ensure that pollutants collect within
structural post- construction BMPs be disposed of in accordance with local,
State and Federal guidelines.
   (c)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the
Village Engineer and the post-construction operator of the BMP, including
homeowner associations, upon completion of construction activities and prior to
the Village Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (d)   Single-Family Residential Developments. A homeowners' association
shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and shall be
continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and inspections in
perpetuity.
   (e)   Multi-Family, Commercial and Industrial Developments. The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post- construction maintenance and inspections in perpetuity.
   (f)   Maintenance Design. Low maintenance requirements are a priority in the
design and construction of all facilities. Multi-use facilities incorporating
assets such as aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of
the drainage facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment
control, water quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-
site structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be
inspected and maintained in perpetuity by the responsible party designated in
the plans and the requirements of this chapter. Inspections and maintenance
will be incorporated periodically throughout the year to ensure that the
facilities are properly operational.
   (g)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections. One inspection with a written
report will be performed each year by the party responsible for the maintenance
and operation of the facility. The written report will be given to the Village
Engineer by May 1 of each and every year after the best management practice
(BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water. A
written and stamped report will be required from a professional engineer on the
status of all structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that
require a permit either at the time of construction or fall under the
jurisdiction of ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is
completed.
      (2)   Easements. A written report from an inspector for the party
responsible for the maintenance and operation of the facility on the status of

erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status of
the related easements shall be submitted to the Village Engineer by May 1 of
each year in perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of life. A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer.
(Ord. 2007-72. Passed 12-12-07.)
1254.10   MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control pollution of water resources, the owner or person
responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   Standards and Specifications. Post-construction runoff practices used
to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county, or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (b)   Water Quality Basins:
      (1)   Pool geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three times the width).
      (2)   Riser in embankment. The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water drains. Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable gate valves. Both the water quality and the storm water
management basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official for the party responsible for the maintenance and operation of the
facility shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
hand wheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal spillway. Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving Summit County. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100-year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into
orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall
be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe
is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (6)   Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
water quality and storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving Summit
County. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless
exempted in writing by the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments. Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving Summit
County. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (8)   Safety features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 20
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one foot
vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (two feet horizontal for every one
foot vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water quality basin. If a water quality basin is needed and can not
be incorporated into an existing or planned detention or retention basin, then
a separate water quality basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed
and maintained in perpetuity.
      (10)   Water quality basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)   Flexibility.
         A.   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the
right of the Village Engineer to impose at any time additional and/or more
stringent requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Village
Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         B.   If the Village Engineer waives, in writing, individual
requirements, the owner will provide the Village Engineer with the information
and documentation required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will
not degrade water quality.
(Ord. 2007-72. Passed 12-12-07.)
1254.11   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village Engineer determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water runoff. Such
alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and likely cost of those
measures that would otherwise be required to meet the objectives of this
section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be implemented within
the drainage area of the proposed development project. Such alternatives shall
meet the following standards:
      (1)   The same level of storm water quantity and quality control that
would be effectuated by the on-site controls required under this regulation is
achieved.
      (2)   The alternatives are implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code
(HUC) 14 watershed unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Section
1254.16(C)(5) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Prior written approval from the EPA is obtained.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer.
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village, to be appliced to
community-wide storm water management practices.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices and/or
the retrofit of an existing practice to increase quantity and quality control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland complexes.

(Ord. 2007-72. Passed 12-12-07.)
1254.15   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   All permanent storm water, soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices not specifically waived by the Village shall be constructed prior to
the granting of the final plat approval. Upon the request of the owner, the
Village may defer the construction or installation of a permanent storm water,
soil erosion, sediment control or water quality practice prior to the approval
of the final plat where, in the Village Engineer's judgment, such proper
construction or installation is not immediately necessary for the protection of
the public health and safety; and where the prior installation or construction
of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in
the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because in the case of
concrete, building construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and
tear on new structures. In such event, the Village shall require a security
bond, escrow account, certified check or cash to guarantee that such deferred
improvements will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed
specified time, but not to exceed six months after the filing of such final
plat. The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, soil erosion, and sediment control and water quality practices.
The Village shall require a security bond, escrow account, certified check or
cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion,
sediment control and water quality practices will be constructed and removed in
a timely manner, as determined by the Village Engineer.
   (a)   The Guarantee. The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash will be used by the
Village to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Village Engineer. The security bond,
escrow account, verified check or cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in Ohio R.C. 711.101.
      (1)   Security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be
deposited with the Village prior to review by the Village Engineer and/or its
consultants to cover professional services of the Village Engineer, Building
and Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the Village.
      (2)   No soil-disturbing activities shall be permitted until a security
bond, escrow account, verified check or cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer sufficient for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible for
the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for the
development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be released only
after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, and Storm Water Management, and Water
Quality Plans having been approved by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee. The furnishing of a performance guarantee will
be maintained in an amount of not less than 120% of the estimate approved by
the Village Engineer, of installation of the deferred improvements.
   (c)   Maintenance Guarantee. The maintenance guarantee shall be maintained
for a period of not less than three years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality practices in an amount
equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Village Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension. The Village Engineer may extend the time allowed for
the installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has
been provided with the receipt of a written request from the owner.
   (e)   Completion. Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment control, and
water quality practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided,
the owner shall notify the Village Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection. The Village will not release the security bond, escrow
account, verified check or cash guarantee until the Village Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Release. The construction maintenance guarantee shall not be released
by the Village until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices
that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and any
trapped sediment has been stabilized.
   (h)   Slow Release Devices. Performance and maintenance guarantees will be
maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed in
detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform ground
cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
(Ord. 2007-72. Passed 12-12-07.)
1254.16   APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PLANS.
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control,
Storm Water Management, Riparian and Wetland Setbacks Plans that have also been
developed for the site.
   (b)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the Village in
accordance with this regulation do not relieve the site owner of responsibility
for obtaining all other necessary permits and/or approvals from Federal, State,
County, and local agencies and departments. If requirements vary, the most
stringent requirement shall be followed. In addition to the Village Engineer,
Summit SWCD will review all Post-Construction Water Quality Plans.
   (c)   The site owner shall submit a report from the Summit SWCD, which
reviews the owner's development, plans and improvement plans. The applicant or
his or her designated representative will pay any costs associated with

(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.07   DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants, that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active ground water
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire
fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Village as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the Building and Zoning Inspector prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes illicit connections made in the
past, unless they were permissible under law at the time of connection and are
granted continuation of use by the Village.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue without the written permission of the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.08   SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Village may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.
      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The Village will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Village for a
reconsideration and hearing.
      (2)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
Village.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.09   INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
Village prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.10   MONITORING OF DISCHARGES
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The Village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the Village.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Village ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by State and Federal law.
      (3)   The Village shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Village to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The Village has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the Village reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Village has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the Village may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.11   REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Village will adopt requirements identifying best management practices
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of
the United states. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal
storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.12   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.13   NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Village in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the Village within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.14   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Whenever the Village finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the Village may order compliance
by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require without limitation:
      (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      (4)   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      (5)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.15   APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the Village. The notice of appeal must be received within 15 days from the date
of the Notice of Violation. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate
authority or his or her designee shall take place within 30 days from the date
of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the Village or their
designee shall be final.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.16   ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 30 days
of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
Village, then representatives of the Village shall enter upon the subject
private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any
person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow
the Village or its designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the
purposes set forth above.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.17   COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (a)   Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of
the assessment within 15 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely
manner as determined by the decision of the Village or by the expiration of the
time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment
against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount
of the assessment.
   (b)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the Village by reason of such violation. The liability shall
be paid in not more than 12 equal monthly payments. Interest at the rate of 12%
per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the thirtieth day
following discovery of the violation.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.18   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the Village may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from
activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.19   VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the
violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
(Ord. 2007-71. Passed 12-12-07.)
1255.20   PROSECUTION.

Overlay Area.
      (2)   The appropriate use or value of the property within the proposed
development will be enhanced.
      (3)   Efforts have been taken to mitigate any significant negative
impacts the proposed development is expected to have on any adjacent
residential properties.
      (4)   The proposed buffer and landscaping meet the requirements of
Section
1267.05 and will assist in protecting the adjacent residential property.
      (5)   Adequate provisions have been made for safe and efficient
pedestrian and vehicular circulation within the site and with respect to
adjacent properties and roadways.
      (6)   The plan provides for an appropriate number of parking spaces based
upon the criteria established by Chapter 1278.
      (7)   The development provides adequate lighting for safe and convenient
use of the streets, walkways, driveways, and parking areas and is designed in a
manner that balances the marketing and development interests of the applicant
with the impact on adjacent areas and considers the impact of direct light,
glare, and glow on adjacent properties so that the lighting does not
unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties.
      (8)   The existing and/or proposed landscaping enhances the quality of
principal buildings, parking lots, and overall site development.
      (9)   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through

of individuals or corporations at any time, provided that the new ownership
complies with all applicable approvals, stipulations, and conditions related to
the approved site plan.
      (2)   The site plan approval shall become null and void if the applicant
does not commence construction or implementation of the plan within two years
of the date of final approval of the site plan by Council. The applicant may
request an extension from Council of the time in which to commence construction
or implementation of the plan.
      (3)   All subsequent construction and development for each component part
may be approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector when he or she determines
that the intended construction is in accordance with the approved site plan.
Any departure from such approved plan shall be considered pursuant to division
(e) of this section.
   (e)   Site Plan Modifications after Approval.
      (1)   A minor modification to the approved site plan may be approved by
the Building and Zoning Inspector. A modification shall be considered minor
when it results in:
         A.   Minor changes to the footprint of the buildings and/or changes in
the floor area allocations for each use or in the general locations as
specified on the approved site plan that do not materially impact parking or
the building layout;
         B.   Changes to signs, lighting, or parking that are essentially
equivalent to what were included in the previously approved site plan; or
         C.   Changes to the landscape plant material that are essentially
equivalent to the approved plant material, provided they do not change the
buffer design as approved by the Planning Commission and Council.
      (2)   Any modification to the approved site plan that does not satisfy
the criteria in this division (e) shall be considered a plan amendment and
shall only be approved pursuant to the procedures for site plan approval as
specified in division (b) of this section.

terrain, etc., the Planning Commission shall have authority to grant a variance
from such requirements.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3753.png]
         A.   The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces when two identical display faces are joined, are parallel or are within
thirty degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point separated by

      (4)   Air between a projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached
and detached lighting fixtures and associated brackets shall not be included in
the calculation of sign area.
   (b)   Sign Height. The height of a free-standing sign shall be measured from
the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the
tallest element of the sign or its support structure. A free-standing sign on a
man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the

between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)   A building is considered to have two frontages whenever the lot
fronts on two or more streets or the building has a public entrance on a wall
other than the wall that faces the street. The property owner shall determine
which wall shall be the primary building frontage and which wall shall be the
secondary building frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be
considered its primary frontage and only one additional wall considered its
secondary frontage.
      (4)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.

candles at any point on the sign face.
      (3)   Signs may use back lighting or halo lighting subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission.

1288.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the regulations in this chapter is to provide criteria to be
used by the Building Department, Planning Commission, and Council when
evaluating the appropriateness of landscaping and landscaping plans for
commercial, business, industrial, and multi-family residential properties in
the Municipality. This chapter is intended to insure that future developments
and newly constructed or renovated properties comply with these standards and
balance the concerns of permitting the property to be utilized in conformance
with this Code; providing an adequate buffer from residential and other
properties; protecting existing landscaping, trees, and vegetation cover;
maintaining an appropriate proportion of deciduous and non-deciduous trees;
controlling erosion and sediment runoff; providing shade; and promoting the
aesthetic appearance of the Village.
(Ord. 2013-127. Passed 11-13-13.)
1288.02   LANDSCAPING PLAN TO BE SUBMITTED TO BUILDING AND ZONING INSPECTOR.
   Applications to construct a new structure or renovate the exterior portion
of an existing property or structure on any commercial, business, industrial,
or multi-family residential property in the Village shall be accompanied by a
landscaping plan, showing the location and type of any trees or landscaping
currently on the property and the location, type, and size of any landscaping
to be installed or modified in connection with the development or renovation.
Such plans shall be designed to address the concerns and requirements set forth
in Sections
1288.01, 1288.03, and 1288.04 of this Chapter. The landscaping plan shall be
filed with the Building and Zoning Inspector for submission to the Planning
Commission and Council for review and approval or rejection based upon the
criteria set forth in Sections
1288.01, 1288.03, and 1288.04. No occupancy permit or final approval for the
development or renovation shall be issued until the landscaping plan is
approved. Such permit or approval shall be conditional on the items set forth
in the plan being implemented and/or planted. For the purposes of this Section,
a renovated structure shall be defined as any existing building that has the
building exterior, which includes doors, entrances, roofing, brick work, or
siding, modified, replaced, or reconstructed. An exterior property renovation
shall be defined as any modification or reconstruction, including re-grading,
paving, changes in the surface conditions, or the addition of signage or
lighting on the property. With respect to structural renovations or exterior
property renovations, landscaping plans shall be required for: (1) all
structural renovations for which the contracted or fair market value of the
total work exceeds twenty percent of the tax value of the structure; and (2)
all exterior property renovations for which the contracted or fair market value
of the total work exceeds twenty percent of the tax value of the parcel of land
on which the exterior property renovation takes place.
(Ord. 2013-127. Passed 11-13-13.)
1288.03   LOCATION OF TREES AND PLANTS AND TREE AND PLANT MATERIALS.
   Trees, plants, and other landscaping shall be in such locations, scale, and
amounts to be integrated with the overall building design; assist with clearly
designating entrances, exits, and vehicular and pedestrian traffic areas;
reasonably screen paved area from the street through the use of mounding, the
land's natural topography, and or adequate vegetation; and provide a suitable
buffer between other properties and residentially zoned land. Landscaping shall
be aesthetically pleasing and positioned and of the type so as to reduce the
potential of damage to sewers and sidewalks. Trees and plant materials shall be
appropriate for the climate and site conditions. The Planning Commission or
Council, after a review by and recommendation from the Planning Commission, may
establish a list of allowable and preferred plant species.
(Ord. 2013-127. Passed 11-13-13.)
1288.04   TREE AND PLANT QUALITY.
   Trees and plants used shall be healthy and free of any defects or disease.
The height and leaf density of trees and plants shall be appropriate for the
location and shall not constitute a traffic hazard. Tree trunk diameters breast
high (DBH) shall be a minimum of two inches. Shrubs that are planted shall be
at least one gallon container in size.
(Ord. 2013-127. Passed 11-13-13.)
1288.05   MAINTENANCE.
   Trees and vegetation shall be considered important elements of developed and
renovated properties. If landscaping materials are damaged during construction
or die subsequent to their installation, they shall be promptly replaced with
trees and plants of identical or similar quality in conformance with the
requirements and guidelines of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-127. Passed 11-13-13.)
1288.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity, or corporation, including, but not limited
to, the owner of the property, his or her agents and assigns, an occupant, a
property manager, and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to
comply with any provision of this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
third degree and shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and
be subject to up to ninety days in jail for each offense. A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or
noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Municipality from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding
in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful landscaping plan in
connection with a development; restrain, correct, or abate a violation; or
require compliance with the provisions of this regulation or other applicable
laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders of the Municipality.

The Building and Zoning Inspector may require supervision of work and
certificates of inspection as provided.
   (b)   All new buildings and additions under construction, and all

new buildings and structures under construction, of additions and alterations
or repairs to existing buildings and structures, of buildings to be moved or

shall notify the Building and Zoning Inspector of the time, as provided herein,
to make such inspection. The notification for inspection shall be given at a
time which will give the Building and Zoning Inspector a reasonable period of
time to make or cause the inspection to be made, and this time shall be as
follows: for inspections required by subsection (a) hereof, the Building and
Zoning Inspector shall be notified not less than forty- eight hours before any
lathing is done or any of the framing or structural parts are covered in a
manner which would make inspection unnecessarily difficult. All the mechanicals
must be inspected and approved before rough building inspection.
(Ord 1969-43. Passed 5-28-69.)
1440.21   APPLICATION OF ZONING CODE.
   The Zoning Code establishes a zoning plan regulating the location of trades,
industries and buildings, the use of premises, the height of buildings and the
location and size of yards and open spaces, establishes building lines, back of

   The restrictions of the Zoning Code shall not be deemed to be modified by
any provisions of this Code, and such restrictions shall be controlling except
insofar as the provisions of this Code are more restrictive.
(Ord. 1969-43. Passed 5-28-69.)

performed in a safe and careful manner so that the same will not endanger
adjoining property or be a hazard to public safety.
   (c)   Before any work, for which a permit is required by this Code, is
commenced, and before any portion of a street or public property is occupied
for any purpose for which a permit is required by this Code, the permit shall
be obtained and posted.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or by other law or
ordinance, when the public is endangered by reason of any construction,
alteration, addition, repair or excavation, or when a hazard exists because of
the condition of a building or structure, or because of an existing excavation,
a suitable barricade shall be provided along any public thoroughfare affected.
If the barricade prevents sufficient passageway on the sidewalk, a temporary
walk or bridge, if necessary, shall be constructed and maintained.
   (e)   All pits, excavation barricades, builders' equipment, building
materials or other temporary objects, which are in or upon a thoroughfare
because of a building operation, and all buildings or structures, shall have
placed upon or near them at all times during darkness, illuminated lamps with
red or amber globes or flares or other approved lights, in a manner that there
shall be one light at each end, and at intermediate points as may be necessary
to afford proper warning consistent with the existing traffic conditions at the
location affected. (Ord. 1969-43. Passed 5-28-69.)
1440.23   STORAGE OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS WITHIN BUILDINGS.
   Materials or equipment needed in a building operation, if stored within the

be taken down and removed when so ordered by the Building and Zoning Inspector.
   (b)   A building or structure declared to be unsafe or unsecured by the
Building and Zoning Inspector may be restored to a safe or secured condition,
provided that if the damage or cost of construction, reconstruction or
restoration is in excess of 56% of the value at which the building or structure
stands on the tax duplicate, inclusive of foundations, the building or
structure, if reconstructed or restored, shall be made to conform, with respect
to materials and type of construction, to the requirements for buildings and
structures hereafter erected. No change of use or occupancy shall be compelled
by reason of such reconstruction or restoration.

at his or her own expense, builds retaining walls or foundations as may be
required to safely protect his or her land and the structures erected thereon.
   (b)   The owner of any lot or land who fills a lot so that the surface of
the same shall be above the established grade of the street, streets or alley
upon which the lot or land abuts, and above the existing surface of any
adjoining lot or land, shall, at his or her own expense, build retaining walls
as may be required to properly protect all adjoining property from damage on
account of the fill.
   (c)   The owner of any lot or land who grades such lot or land so that the
level of the lot or land is below the established grade of the street, streets
or alley on which the lot or land abuts, shall, at his or her own expense,
build retaining walls, as may be required to protect the adjoining property
from damage because of the grading below the established grade or grades, and
he or she shall give the owner of the adjoining lot or land which may be
affected proper notice, by registered mail, before beginning such grading.
   (d)   When an excavation is carried to a depth of nine feet or less below
the established grade, the owner of any adjoining or contiguous wall or
structure which may be affected by the excavation shall reinforce the same if
required and so support the same by proper foundations that it is and remains
as safe as before such excavation was commenced.
   (e)   This section is written for the protection of the public and builder,
and the enforcement of this section shall be by civil action. (Ord. 1969-43.

the duty of the person making the excavation to build foundations as may be
required to make the wall or structure as safe as it was before the excavation
was commenced.
   (b)   If the necessary permission to enter the adjoining building or upon
the adjoining land, for the purpose of performing the work required under
Sections
1442.01 and
1442.02, is not accorded the person making the excavation, then it shall be the
duty of the owner refusing to grant permission to make the adjoining or
contiguous wall or structure safe and to support the same without delay by
proper foundations, or to take other precautions as may be required so that the
excavation may be made, and, when necessary for that purpose, the adjoining
owner shall be permitted to enter upon the premises where the excavation is
being made.

furnish material and take such steps as, in his or her judgment, may be
necessary to make the same safe and secure, or to prevent the same from
becoming unsafe or dangerous, at the expense of the person whose duty it is to
keep the same safe and secure. Any party doing the work, or any part thereof,
under and by direction of the Inspector, may bring and maintain an action
against the person whose duty it is to perform such work, to recover the value

   When a doubt arises as to the safe sustaining power of the soil upon which a
building or structure is to be erected, or if it is desired to exceed the
allowable soil bearing capacity, the Building and Zoning Inspector may direct
that borings or load tests be made, by and at the expense of the owner of the
proposed building or structure, to determine the sustaining power of the soil.

notified so that he or she may be present in person or be represented. A
complete record of the test shall be filed with the Building and Zoning
Inspector. (Ord. 1969-43. Passed 5-28-69.)

leveled and sealed in mortar or shall rest on a hard, dense, impregnated fiber
board of other approved material.
   (c)   Except as herein provided box sills shall consist of not less than a
two-inch by eight- inch piece laid flat, and a piece of the same dimension as
the joists, set on edge and securely spiked to the plate. When there is a
thickness of not less than four inches of solid masonry under a sill, the piece
laid flat may be not less than two inches by six inches. At least two 16d
common nails shall be used through the upright of the sill to nail the sill to
each joist end.
    (d)   For solid sills, the upright of the sill may be omitted and the
studding shall have full bearing on the wall plate. Solid bridging, of the same
thickness and depth as the joists, shall be placed and securely nailed between
the joists at the inside face of the foundation so as to form an effective
firestop for the space between the studding, joists and outside wall sheathing.
   (e)   Where studding does not bear directly on the wall plates and the floor
joists run parallel to the foundation wall, solid bridging or blocking, of the
same thickness and depth as the upright of the sill, shall be placed between
the upright of the sill and the first joist running parallel to the wall, at
intervals of not to exceed three feet and under all concentrated loads in the
outside wall. The upright of the sill shall be spiked to such bridging or
blocking with not less than two 16d common nails and the first joist shall be
spiked to the other end of the bridging in the same manner. A joist running
parallel with the plate may be used in lieu of the bridging above, provided
that such joist has not less than one-half inch bearing on the full length of
the plate.

setting forth their respective responsibilities for correcting the violations
enumerated in the Certificate which remain uncorrected and setting forth the

1446.01   RENTAL CERTIFICATE.
   No single-family residential dwelling structure shall be rented or presently
occupied under a rental agreement, whether written or oral, unless the Building
and Zoning Inspector has issued to the owner or authorized agent of the
property owner, a rental certificate and exterior inspection rental
certificate. Rental certificates shall be effective until June 30 of the year
after the year in which the rental certificate is issued.
   (a)   In order to obtain a rental certificate, the owner of the property, or
his, her, or its authorized agent, shall, prior to May 1 of each year, or sixty
days prior to the commencement of a lease term for properties to be first
rented after June 30 in any year, submit a completed rental certificate
application, which includes a request for an exterior inspection or statement
that such inspection is not required pursuant to the requirements of this
chapter, on the rental certificate application form available from the Building
and Zoning Department. A rental certificate shall not be issued unless a
current exterior inspection rental certificate is obtained and the property is
current on its Village sewer maintenance fee account.
   (b)   Any owner of property being rented to a tenant that is not in
possession of a current rental certificate shall be in violation of this
chapter.
   (c)   Upon receipt of the fully completed application by the Building and
Zoning Department, an exterior rental certificate inspection shall be scheduled
and conducted within thirty days.
   (d)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall issue an inspection report
within five working days of the date of inspection listing any violations of
the maintenance standards contained in the Village's Building and Housing Code
existing at the time of the exterior inspection, if any.
   (e)   Upon completion of the rental inspection, any noted violations posing
a risk to the safety of any person occupying the property shall be corrected
prior to the issuance of the exterior inspection rental certificate.
   (f)   If no violations or minor violations are noted from the inspection, an
exterior inspection rental certificate will be issued, permitting the property
to be rented in compliance with this chapter.
   (g)   The Building and Zoning Inspector will provide compliance dates for
minor violations noted on the inspection report. In the event the violations
are not corrected by the compliance dates indicated on the report, the exterior
inspection rental certificate and rental certificate may be revoked by the
Building and Zoning Inspector and/or the property owner and/or agent may be
considered to be in violation of this chapter.
   (h)   Properties that are rented subsequent to June 30 in any year that were
not granted rental certificates prior to July 1 must apply for a rental
certificate at least sixty days prior to the commencement of a lease and
receive a rental certificate and exterior inspection rental certificate prior
to the date any tenant moves into the property. Applications not filed prior to
the May 1 deadline, or filed subsequent to sixty days prior to the tenant
moving into the property shall be charged a one hundred dollar ($100.00) late
fee.
   (i)   The requirements of this chapter shall not relieve the property owner
from his, her, or its obligation to obtain a point of sale exterior inspection
certificate in connection with a sale of the property. The receipt of a point
of sale exterior inspection certificate, and the correction of all violations
related thereto, shall relieve the property owner from his, her, or its
obligation to obtain an exterior inspection rental certificate for the calendar
year in which the point of sale exterior inspection certificate is issued and
the year thereafter.
   (j)   Rental properties that undergo a rental exterior inspection and do not
have any violations at the time of the first inspection shall be granted a
rental certificate that is good for two rental inspection years instead of one.
Rental properties with two-year rental certificates are required to submit a
completed rental certificate application for the second year of the rental
certificate but will not be required to be inspected for the second year of the
rental certificate.

   (a)   Criminal Penalties.
      (1)   Except as a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.17 involves subject matter
covered by the Ohio Fire Code, and except as such a violation is covered by
Ohio R.C. 3737.99(G), whoever violates Section
1610.035 or Section
1610.05(a) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
(ORC 3737.99(B)) (Ord. 2013-23. Passed 2-13-13.)
      (2)   Whoever violates Section
1610.05(b) or 1610.06 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 3737.99(C))
      (3)   Whoever violates Section
1610.07 or
1610.09 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
(ORC 3737.99(D))
      (4)   Whoever violates Section
1610.08 or
1610.10 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 3737.99(E))
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   Any person who has received a citation for a serious violation of
the Ohio Fire Code or any order issued pursuant to it shall be assessed a civil
penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each such violation.
      (2)   Any person who has received a citation for a violation of the Ohio
Fire Code or any order issued pursuant to it, and such violation is
specifically determined not to be of a serious nature, may be assessed a civil
penalty of not more than the following amounts. Violations determined not to be
serious violations or cited as less than serious violations shall be assessed a
civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for severe
violations, not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for moderate
violations, and not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for minor
violations.
      (3)   Any person who fails to correct a violation for which a citation
has been issued, within the period permitted for its correction, may be
assessed a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
each day during which such failure or violation continues.
      (4)   Any person who violates any of the posting requirements prescribed
by Ohio R.C. 3737.42(C), or a substantially similar Municipal ordinance, shall
be assessed a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for
each violation.
      (5)   Due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with
respect to the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the person being
charged, and the history of previous violations shall be given whenever a
penalty is assessed under this chapter.
      (6)   For purposes of this section, a serious violation shall be
considered to exist if there is a substantial probability that an occurrence
causing death or serious physical harm to persons could result from a condition
which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations or
processes which have been adopted or are in use, unless the person did not and
could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of
the violation.
      A severe violation shall be considered to exist if the code violation
represents a serious safety risk to persons. Examples of these situations
include fire systems that are out of service, overcrowding, longstanding
uncorrected fire code violations, or locked egress doors. These issues shall be
immediately corrected or a plan of action shall, with reasonable and deliberate
speed, be submitted to and approved by the Fire Department.
      A moderate violation is one that represents a serious safety risk but not
an immediate life safety hazard. These types of violations typically require a
third party service or testing to correct the problem. The time granted by the
inspector to remedy the problem shall be based upon the nature of the violation
and circumstances. Examples of these types of violations are out of service or
out of date fire protection systems, major electrical or structural issues,
blocked suppression systems, or dangerous storage situations.
      A minor violation is a violation that does not represent an immediate
life hazard and is easily corrective. Such violations should cost less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) in materials to correct and be able to be completed
with little or no technical assistance. Examples of these violations include
extension cords, exit signs with burnt out batteries, housekeeping issues,
missing addresses, held open fire doors, dead emergency light batteries,
missing and out of date fire extinguishers, missing ceiling tiles or fire
protection breaks, minor electrical issues such as missing face plates and
multi-plug adaptors, blocked exit doors and pathways, or other easily
correctible fire code violations.
      (7)   Civil penalties imposed under this chapter shall be paid to the
Village Director of Finance for deposit into the General Fund. Such penalties
may be recovered in a civil action in the name of the Municipality brought in
the Court of Common Pleas.
