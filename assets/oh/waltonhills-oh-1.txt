CERTIFICATION
   I, Kevin Hurst, Mayor, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23 and 731.42, hereby
certify that the general and permanent legislation of the Village of Walton
Hills, Ohio, as revised, arranged, compiled, numbered, codified and printed
herewith in component codes, is correctly set forth and constitutes the
Codified Ordinances of Walton Hills, Ohio, 1999, complete to October 17, 2023.
                           /s/   Kevin Hurst
                              Mayor
EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow
660.06 and precede
660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind
required to be in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the
Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

(ORC 1.49)
202.08   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

220.01   REGULAR AND SPECIAL MEETINGS; QUORUM; AUTOMATIC EXCUSE.
   (a)   Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of Council shall be held in the
Village Hall following the Council Caucus which begins at 7:00 p.m. on the
third Tuesday of each month. Whenever the date of a regular meeting falls on a
legal holiday, such meeting shall automatically be held on the following day
after the Council Caucus which begins at 7:00 p.m.
   (b)   Special Meetings. Council shall hold such special meetings in the
Village Hall as may be found necessary. They may be called by the Mayor or any
three members of Council upon at least twenty-four hours' written notice of the
date and time of such meeting to each member of Council served personally or
left at his or her usual place of residence. In addition, the Mayor, Clerk,
Solicitor and Treasurer shall be similarly served with notice, but failure to
do so shall not invalidate any action taken at such meeting. Any member of
Council may expressly waive notice. Whenever a member of Council who has not
properly been served with notice is present at such special meeting, the giving
of notice shall be deemed waived by such member. Such notice shall state, in
addition to the date and time, the purpose of the special meeting, and no other
business shall be acted upon at such special meeting.
   (c)   Meetings Open to Public. All meetings of Council shall be open to the
public.
   (d)   Quorum.
      (1)   Regular meetings. Four members of Council shall constitute a quorum
to do business at a regular meeting, but a lesser number may adjourn from day
to day to another date and time. Notice of such adjournment and of the date and
time thereof need not be given to each member not in attendance, if the date
and time to which the meeting is adjourned are fixed and announced at the
meeting adjourned. Any action which might have been taken at the original
meeting may be taken at the adjourned meeting. In the absence of a quorum at
the time appointed for a meeting, the members present may, by a majority vote,
recess and cause the Chief of Police or a Patrolman to procure the attendance
of absent members, or adjourn the meeting to another date and time.
      (2)   Special meetings. Four members of Council shall constitute a quorum
to do business at a special meeting. If a quorum is not present, the procedure
for calling a special meeting shall be repeated.
   (e)   Automatic excuse.
      (1)   Any member of the legislative authority of the Village shall be
deemed automatically excused from attendance at a regular Council meeting when
such non-attendance occurs as a result of said member attending to official
Village business. For purposes of this section, the term "official Village
business" shall be defined as attendance at a seminar or meeting of any
organization whose business relates to the governing of municipalities in
general or in response to any emergency situation the nature of which is such
as to require immediate response. Any member of the legislative authority who
shall be absent from a meeting hereunder shall file a signed statement with the
Fiscal Officer advising of such non-attendance and the reason therefor.
      (2)   Any member of the legislative authority who is unable to attend a
meeting of the legislative authority due to illness and who, subsequent
thereto, files with the Fiscal Officer a communication signed by a physician
licensed to practice in the State of Ohio requesting that said member be
excused from said meeting, shall be deemed automatically excused from regular
attendance at said meeting of the legislative authority.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided herein, all other laws regarding
attendance and the excuse of members of the legislative authority for non-
attendance at the meetings of the legislative authority shall remain in full
force and effect.

220.02   POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE CHAIR.
   (a)   Call to Order. At each meeting, the Mayor, or in his or her absence,
the President Pro Tem of Council, shall take the Chair at the hour appointed
for Council to meet, and immediately shall call Council to order. The Clerk
shall enter in the journal the names of members of Council present thereat.
   (b)   Temporary Chairperson. In case of the absence of the Mayor and the
President Pro Tem of Council, the Clerk shall call Council to order. The Clerk
shall call the roll and, if a quorum is found to be present, Council shall
proceed to elect, by a majority vote, a temporary Chairperson of the meeting
until the appearance of the Mayor or the President Pro Tem of Council.
   (c)   Appeals From Decisions of Chair. The Chair shall preserve decorum and
decide all questions of order, subject to appeal to Council. If any member
violates any of the Rules of Council, the Chair shall, or any member may, call
him or her to order and, in the latter instance, the Chair shall render a
decision as to the point of order. In case of an appeal from any ruling of the
Chair, the question shall be: "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
decision of Council?" The decision of the Chair shall be sustained unless
overruled by a majority vote of the members of Council present.
   (d)   Chair's Power to Vote. The Mayor shall have no vote except in the
event of a tie vote of members of Council present. Any member of Council who is
serving as Chairperson shall retain the power to vote on any matter.
(Res. 1974-9. Passed 2-19-74.)
220.03   ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   President Pro Tem. At the regular meeting in January of each year,
Council shall immediately proceed to elect a President Pro Tem from its own
number, who shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his or
her election as President Pro Tem. If the President Pro Tem should succeed to
the office of Mayor, then Council shall fill the vacancy thus created in
accordance with subsection (f) hereof and thereafter elect another President
Pro Tem from its own number, who shall have the same rights, powers and duties
as his or her predecessor.
   (b)   Addressing Chair. Members, when about to speak to a question or make a
motion, shall address the Chair as "Mayor", "President" or "Chairperson", who
shall announce the name of the member of Council entitled to the floor by
addressing him or her as "Councilperson ______________________________".
   (c)   Debate. Members shall confine themselves to the questions under
debate. No member shall be allowed to speak more than once upon any one subject
until every member choosing to speak has spoken, nor more than twice upon the
same subject, nor for a time longer than five minutes, without leave of Council
authorized by a majority vote of the members present. On demand of any member,
a question under consideration, which covers two or more points, shall be
divided where the question admits of such division.
   (d)   Seating Arrangement. The Clerk, Treasurer and Solicitor shall occupy
such seats in the Council Chamber as decided by the Chair. Remaining seats in
the Council Chamber shall be occupied by preference of the members having the
greater length of continuous service as members of Council, provided, however,
that in any case the President Pro Tem shall have first preference. In case
more than one member have the same continuous service and desire the same
Chair, the choice shall be decided by lot.
   (e)   Clerk's Absence. In case of the absence of the Clerk from any Council
meeting, Council shall appoint one of its own members to perform the duties of
the Clerk at such meeting.
   (f)   Vacancy. When the office of a member of Council becomes vacant, the
vacancy shall be filled by election by a majority vote of all members elected
to Council, for the unexpired term, provided, however, that if Council fails
within 45 days to fill such vacancy, the Mayor shall fill it by appointment
within 15 days, or the cycle repeats. Letters of interest may be completed and
submitted to Council by residents who are interested in the open Council
position. All letters of interest will be open for public viewing. Unsuccessful
candidates from the last election for Council shall be given consideration.
   (g)   Legal Advice. The Solicitor shall be permitted to address Council at
any time on any question or matter then pending or to be considered by Council
regarding the legal considerations involved therein. This privilege shall not
be subject to amendment except by the unanimous vote of all members elected to
Council.
   (h)   Legislation. No ordinance or resolution, except that of a routine or
repetitive nature, shall be prepared by the Solicitor unless requested by three
members of Council or by the Mayor.
   Any ordinance or resolution may be referred to committee by motion, duly
adopted by majority vote, and such reference shall indicate the date by which
the committee shall report back to Council. Failure of the committee to report
by such date shall be considered as if reported back without recommendation,
unless the time for report is extended by Council. If no such extension is
granted, the ordinance or resolution shall take its appropriate place on the
calendar.
   Where an ordinance or resolution is properly a subject for principal
consideration by more than one committee, it shall be referred to each
committee, or to any of such committees, as shall be determined by a majority
vote of Council.
   (i)   Awards and Citations. Motions directed toward the preparation of
resolutions of appreciation or congratulations, or any discussion in connection
therewith, shall be advanced in a meeting of Council resolved as a Committee of
the Whole.
(Res 1974-9. Passed 2-19-74; Ord. 2010-23. Passed 6-15-10.)
220.04   COMMITTEES.
   (a)   Standing Committees Established. The following standing committees of
Council are hereby established:
      Committee of the Whole
      Economic Development
      Finance
      Information
      Infrastructure
      Recreation and Community Life
      Safety and Insurance.
   (b)   Appointment to Standing Committees. Prior to the second regular
Council meeting in January of each year, Council shall meet as a Committee of
the Whole, and the President Pro Tem shall at that time appoint members of
Council to standing committees and appoint Chairpersons. The President Pro Tem,
in making such appointments, shall be guided by the qualifications of the
members of Council, as well as by their personal preferences. Each standing
committee shall consist of three members each, with the exception of the
Finance Committee which shall consist of six members of Council. No member of
Council shall serve on more than five standing committees. The President Pro
Tem shall be, ex officio, a member of every standing committee of which he or
she is not an appointed member, with authority to enter into its deliberations
but without authority to vote.
   (c)   Special Committees. The President Pro Tem shall appoint such special
committees as the Mayor or a majority of the members of Council deem necessary,
provided, however, that any matter properly the concern of any standing
committee, or which is then referred to or pending before such standing
committee, may not, without the consent of such standing committee, be referred
to or considered by a special committee. A special committee may consist of
either one, three or six members of Council.
   (d)   Committee of the Whole. Council may resolve itself into a Committee of
the Whole.
   (e)   Chairpersons of Committees. No member of Council shall be Chairperson
of more than two standing committees. The President Pro Tem shall be
Chairperson of the Finance Committee and one additional standing committee.
   The President Pro Tem shall appoint the Chairpersons of the special
committees.
   In the absence of a committee Chairperson the other members present, if
constituting a quorum, shall elect a temporary Chairperson.
   The Chairperson of any committee shall always be entitled to vote on any
matter being considered by such committee.
   (f)   Committee Secretary. Each committee may elect a secretary from among
its members to keep a record of attendance and business transacted.
   (g)   Meetings. All committees shall meet on the call of the Chairperson, or
on request of a majority of the members thereof, upon at least twelve hours'
written notice of the date and time of such meeting to each committee member,
and to the President Pro Tem, served personally or left at his or her usual
place of residence. Any member may waive notice. The presence of any member at
any committee meeting shall be deemed a waiver as to such member of any
irregularity in notice. By a unanimous vote of all members appointed to a
committee, such committee shall have power to vary the notice requirements of
these rules, except that in no event shall any such variance eliminate the
requirement of notifying the President Pro Tem of any meeting.
   A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum. All
questions shall be decided by a majority vote of those members present at any
committee meeting at which there is a quorum.
   (h)   Committee Reports. Committee reports shall be in writing, except when
waived by Council. The report of a majority of the members of a committee shall
constitute the report of the committee, provided, however, that any member is
entitled to prepare and present to Council a minority report. Council may
accept or reject any committee report, in whole or in part.
   Upon motion and by a majority vote, Council may relieve a committee of
further consideration of any question and order it placed on the calendar. When
any matter is referred to a committee with instructions to report at a time
named in the order or reference, failure to report at such time shall be
considered as if reported back without recommendation, unless the time for
report is extended by Council. If no such extension is granted, the committee
shall forthwith return to the Clerk the documents pertaining thereto, and the
matter shall take its appropriate place on the calendar.
   (i)   Public Hearings. With the approval of a majority of Council, a
committee may hold a public hearing in connection with any matter under
consideration before it.

220.06   AGENDA.
   (a)   Preparation and Delivery of Agenda. The Mayor shall be responsible for

the previous meeting and, monthly, copies of a financial report of the Village,
in such form as requested by Council. Each committee having a report to deliver

minutes and reports shall be delivered to the Mayor no later than the Monday

delivered with the agenda, as aforesaid, copies of each to each Councilman, and
copies of the minutes and reports to the Solicitor.
(Res. 1974-9. Passed 2-19-74.)
220.07   RULES OF ORDER.
   (a)   Motions. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the
Chair before debate. Any member of Council may demand that it be reduced to
writing. A motion shall pass upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority
of the members present.
   (b)   Order of Precedence. When a question is before Council, only the
following motions shall be entertained, which shall take precedence in the
order stated:
      (1)   Motion to adjourn.
      (2)   Motion to recess.
      (3)   Motion to lay the question on the table.
      (4)   Motion to the previous question.
      (5)   Motion to refer.
      (6)   Motion to amend.
      (7)   Motion to postpone the question indefinitely.
   (c)   Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn shall be in order at any time
except:
      (1)   When repeated without intervening business or discussion.
      (2)   When made while another member is speaking.
      (3)   When the previous question has been ordered.
      (4)   When a vote is being taken.
   A motion to adjourn is not debatable, except as to the time to which the
meeting is adjourned.
   (d)   Motion to Lay the Question on the Table. A motion to lay on the table
shall preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. A
majority vote of the members present may take the question up from the table at
the same meeting or any other meeting; provided that, any question that has
laid on the table for a period of 90 days without the question being taken up
by Council shall be removed from the table after said 90 days without a vote
thereon for consideration. This action shall not frustrate any representment of
the tabled issue at any subsequent Council committee meeting, including the
Committee of the Whole, but it does preclude any presentment of the same issue
directly to Council within six months of the matter being removed from the
table for failing to return to the Council agenda within 90 days. To return a
matter from the table to the Council agenda requires a vote in favor by at
least three members of Council.
   (e)   Motion to the Previous Question. The previous question shall be stated
in these words: "Shall debate now close?" The motion shall pass upon the
affirmative vote of two thirds of the members present. If such motion is
ordered, there shall be no further amendment or debate, but the question shall
be put immediately.
   (f)   Motion to Postpone the Question. Motions to postpone a question may be
amended as to time, excepting a motion to postpone indefinitely. If a motion to
postpone the question indefinitely is carried, the principal question shall be
declared lost.
   (g)   Motion to Amend. A motion to amend shall be susceptible of but one
amendment. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same form.
   (h)   Audience Participation. Audience participation at regular Council
meetings shall follow these guidelines:
      (1)   Public comments may address items on which the Council may take
action by way of a resolution or an ordinance, information items or any
particular items of concern to the Village. Comments must follow acceptable
public decorum. While criticism of a Council action is acceptable, personal
attacks are out of order and will not be tolerated.
      (2)   A sign-in log will be used to determine the order of residents
offering comments or asking questions.
      (3)   Members of the public who wish to address Council when recognized
shall stand at the microphone, give their name and address before proceeding
with their comments.
      (4)   Public comment shall be limited to five minutes per person, not to
exceed 30 minutes total for the public involvement of the Council meeting.
Council may respond to residents' questions or inquiries, without infringing on
the speaker's allotted time. Individual or total time allotted may be extended
only at the Mayor's discretion. The Mayor retains the right to stop discussions
if the meeting becomes unruly.
      (5)   Short written statements or questions may be submitted before the
Council meeting. When speaking, each member of the public is encouraged to
provide concise comments that include their positions on the particular item
being addressed. Comments or questions from the public are to be made to the
Mayor, who is the presiding officer, and not to the audience, as if their
comments were a public presentation.
      (6)   A Council meeting is not the forum for debate, which is not
permitted at a Council meeting.
      (7)   The Chief of Police, or his or her designee, shall be the Sergeant
of Arms at each Council meeting and may remove disruptive audience members.
   (i)   Other Parliamentary Rules. Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the
deliberations of Council.
(Res. 1974-9. Passed 2-19-74; Ord. 2001-4. Passed 2-6-01; Ord. 2012-4. Passed
2-17-15.)
220.08   COMPENSATION.
   (a)   The annual salary of each member of Council shall be as determined
from time to time by Council. The member of Council who is elected President
Pro Tem, in accordance with Section
220.03(a), shall receive additional compensation beyond such salary in an
amount determined by Council.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   If, because of an injury or for health reasons, the Mayor of the

      (1)   Population divided by assessed value per capita.
      (2)   Population divided by per capita income.
      (3)   Population times population density.
      (4)   Number of individuals receiving public assistance.
236.05   INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Policy. This section, in conjunction with Ohio R.C. 135.14, and
ordinances adopted by the Village Council, as amended, will govern the
investment activities of the Village. It will be reviewed annually for
compliance and to assure the flexibility necessary to effectively manage the
portfolio.
   (b)   Scope. This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the
Village. These funds are accounted for in the UAN Accounting System.
   (c)   Objectives. The overall objective of the investment program is to
maximize the returns of the Village's excess cash balances consistent with
complete safety of the portfolio's principal value and the liquidity desired.
      (1)   Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective. Investments
of the Village shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid
to enable the Village to meet all operating requirements which might be
reasonably anticipated.
      (3)   Return on investments. The investment portfolio will be designed to
maximize rate of return without jeopardizing the objectives of safety or
liquidity. The six-month treasury bill will be used as a benchmark to determine
the extent to which this objective has been met. This benchmark is subject to
change as investment strategies change.
   (d)   Authority for Investment Activity. The authority to execute investment
transactions is delegated to the Fiscal Officer who shall establish written
procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this
investment policy. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as
provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the
Fiscal Officer.
   (e)   The Standard of Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by
investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be
applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investments shall be
made with judgment and care under circumstances then prevailing, which persons
of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their
own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and this
investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
   (f)   Ethics and Conflicts of Interest. Officials and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair
their ability to make impartial investment decisions.
   (g)   Authorized and Suitable Investments. The Village will be permitted to
invest in any security specifically authorized by Ohio R.C. 135.14, as amended.
The Village will not invest in derivative securities as defined in the Ohio
Revised Code. The use of leverage is prohibited. A copy of the Village
ordinances and Ohio R.C. 135.14 listing permitted securities will be kept with
this policy.
   Eligible obligations include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Obligations of the United States Government
         U.S. Treasury bills
         U.S. Treasury notes
         U.S. Treasury bonds
      (2)   Instrumentalities of the Federal Government
         Federal Farm Credit Bank
         Federal Home Loan Bank
         Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
         Federal National Mortgage Association
      (3)   Commercial paper issued by any corporation incorporated under the
laws of the United States or any state, provided that two nationally recognized
rating agencies have ranked the commercial paper in the highest category.
      (4)   Banker's acceptances, provided that they mature in 270 days or less
and are eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve System.
      (5)   The Ohio State Treasurer's Asset Reserve Fund (STAR Ohio)
      (6)   Repurchase agreements with eligible institutions
      (7)   Bank certificates of deposit with eligible institutions
      (8)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio
   (h)   Diversification. The Village will diversify its investments by
security type and institution. With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities,
those instruments completely guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury as payment of the
principal and interest, and the Ohio State Treasurer's Asset Reserve Fund (STAR
Ohio), no more than 50% of the Village's total investment portfolio will be
invested in a single security type or with a single financial institution.
   (i)   Maximum Maturities. No investment transaction shall be executed
unless, at the time of investment, all members of the Investment Board (Mayor,
Fiscal Officer, and Solicitor) unanimously agree that there is a reasonable
expectation that the investment can be held until its maturity. No investment
shall be redeemed or sold prior to maturity unless required for liquidity
purposes, to maintain the portfolio's current characteristics and/or to enhance
its yield. Swapping (i.e., the simultaneous sale of one security and the
purchase of another) will be permitted provided that the loss, if any, on the
sale is expected to be recovered in one-half the time remaining to maturity of
the security being sold.
   The Village will not directly invest in securities maturing more than two
years from the date of purchase unless the maturity of such investments is made
to coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of the funds. The
average weighted maturity will not exceed one year. Commencing January 1, 2007,
interest earned from investing money shall be credited to the Capital
Improvement Fund except where otherwise required by law.
   (j)   Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions. All transactions will
be done on a competitive basis, whenever possible. Bids and offerings will be
solicited from three dealers and recorded. In the event that two or more
dealers are tied with the lowest price, the transaction will be awarded at the
discretion of the Investment Board.
   A list of approved securities dealers will be maintained with this policy.
Investments may be safekept at any of the approved dealers or banks as
established by the Investment Board.
   (k)   Reporting. The Fiscal Officer shall provide to the Investment Board
(Mayor, Fiscal Officer, and Solicitor), and to Council, monthly reports which
will present a clear picture of the status of the current investment portfolio.
Current yield as compared to the designated benchmark will also be presented in
order to determine the extent to which investment objectives have been met.
These reports will be used by the Investment Board to determine and set
investment requirements for future months.
   (l)   Investment Policy Adoption. The investment policy of the Village shall
be adopted by resolution of the Village Council. This policy shall be reviewed
annually by the Finance Committee and any modifications made thereto must be
approved by Council.
(Res. 1996-19. Passed 11-19-96; Ord. 2007-24. Passed 6-19-07.)

encumbrances to be decertified by January 31 of every year, unless said
encumbrance is extended by motion passed by a majority of Council.
(Ord. 2010-31. Passed 10-19-10.)
236.07   PETTY CASH FUNDS.
   Petty cash funds will be established for the following departments to
improve operational efficiency and reduce the level of paperwork and manual
effort in executing minor expenditures:
   (a)   The Administration/Finance Department shall maintain petty cash funds
in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00). Said funds shall be accessed

which, in his or her judgment, will promote the general welfare of the Village.

five hundred dollars ($500.00). Said funds shall be accessed and accounted for

judgment, will promote the general welfare of the Village.
   (c)   The Recreation and Community Life Department shall maintain petty cash
funds in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Said funds shall be

      (1)   “Illegally used controlled substances or drugs.” This term refers
to any illegal drug or any substance identified in Schedules I through V of
Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), and as further
defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15. This includes, but is not limited
to, marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP) and cocaine, as well
as so-called “designer drugs” not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Illegal
use” includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs and
use of illegally obtained prescription drugs.
      (2)   “Legal drugs.” The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and
nonprescribed medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance
which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor
skills or judgment may be adversely affected should be reported to supervisory
personnel and medical advice should be sought, as appropriate, before
performing work-related duties.
      (3)   “Alcohol.” The use of alcohol-containing beverages or substances,
such that alcohol is present in the body while performing Village business, is
prohibited.
   (e)   Prohibited Conduct.
      (1)   Manufacture, trafficking, possession and use. Any employee engaging
in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited
substances (controlled substances or illegal drugs or alcohol) on Village
premises, in Village vehicles, or while on Village business, shall be subject
to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Law enforcement shall
be notified, as appropriate, where criminal activity is suspected.
      (2)   Intoxication/under the influence. Any employee who is reasonably
suspected of being intoxicated, impaired or under the influence of a prohibited
substance (such as having a prohibited substance in the body) shall be
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of his or
her condition. Employees found to be under the influence of prohibited
substances or who fail to pass a drug test shall be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including termination.
      (3)   Compliance with testing requirements. In an effort to maintain a
drug and alcohol-free workplace, all employees shall be subject to urine and
blood testing. Any employee who refuses to comply with a request for drug
testing, who provides false information in connection with a test, or who
attempts to falsify test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration
or substitution, shall be terminated for insubordination.
      (4)   Treatment requirements. All employees are encouraged to make use of
the available resources for treatment of substance abuse problems. The Village
offers the employee assistance program through the office of the Mayor. Under
certain circumstances, employees may be required to undergo treatment for
substance abuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with Village
requirements for treatment, after care, or return to duty, shall be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (5)   Notifying the immediate supervisor of criminal drug and/or alcohol
arrests and/or charges. Any employee who fails to notify their immediate
supervisor immediately, in writing, of any arrests and/or charges for violation
of any criminal drug and/or alcohol statute violation, shall be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination for failure to so report.
      (6)   Proper application of the policy. The Village is dedicated to
assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy.
Therefore, supervisor/managers are encouraged to use and apply all aspects of
this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who
knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to
deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
   (f)   Drug Testing. All employees shall be subject to analytical testing of
either urine or blood prior to employment, for reasonable cause, following an
accident, and prior to and after return to duty after failing a drug test and/
or after completion of rehabilitation treatment or as required by Federal
regulations. To comply with Urban Mass Transit Administration 49 CFR 653.17,
employees who perform UMTA- defined “sensitive safety” functions shall also be
subject to testing on a random, unannounced basis.
   Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy
and reliability and using techniques and laboratory facilities which have been
approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The
Village affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy and
confidentiality throughout the testing process. Personal data regarding the
drug testing program shall be released only to those persons who have a bona
fide need to know the information for proper administration of the anti-drug
program.
      (1)   Pre-employment testing. All applicants shall undergo chemical
testing prior to employment. Receipt by the Mayor of satisfactory test results
is required prior to employment, and failure of a drug test shall disqualify an
applicant for employment for a period of 120 days. Evidence of the absence of
drug or alcohol dependency from a substance abuse treatment provider or other
qualified medical or mental health practitioner shall be required prior to
further consideration for employment.
      (2)   Reasonable cause testing. Employees may be subject to a fitness for
duty evaluation, to include appropriate urine and/or blood testing, when there
is reason to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job
performance. A reasonable cause referral for testing shall be made on the basis
of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the
long or short-term effects of substance abuse. Examples of reasonable cause
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-
the-job behavior;
         B.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
         C.   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession
or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited substances;
         D.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.   Fights (to mean physical contact), assaults and flagrant
disregard or violations of established safety, security or other operating
procedures.
   Reasonable cause testing determinations shall be made by supervisors who are
trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who
reasonably conclude that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in
his or her work performance due to substance abuse.
      (3)   Post-accident testing. Employees shall be subject to urine and/or
blood testing if they are involved in an accident that results in a fatality,
injuries requiring medical attention, or property damage estimated to be equal
to or greater than four hundred dollars ($400.00).
      (4)   Random testing. Employees in UMTA-defined “sensitive safety”
positions shall be subject to random, unannounced urine testing.
      (5)   Return to duty testing. All employees who previously tested
positive on a drug test shall test negative and be evaluated and released to
duty by the Mayor before returning to work. Employees may be subject to
monitored random urine testing during the period of their re-entry contract.
      (6)   Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results
of a required test under paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) hereof may request that
an additional test be conducted. This test may be conducted at the same or a
different testing laboratory, provided the laboratory is certified by DHHS to
meet 29 CFR Part 40 requirements. The testing shall be conducted on the same
specimen originally submitted to the Village's laboratory and all costs for
such testing shall be paid by the employee.
   (g)   Employee Assistance. It is the Village's policy to provide assistance
to employees and immediate family members who experience personal problems,
including substance abuse or dependency, which may adversely affect job
performance. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek assistance in dealing
with emotional, physical or mental health problems, including substance abuse.
Confidential professional assistance, treatment planning and rehabilitation
services are available, as needed. In an instance where a management referral
is made, confidentiality means that only the employee assistance program
coordinator and the referring supervisor shall be aware of the circumstances of
the referral.
   A request for assistance for a substance abuse problem shall not, in itself,
be considered grounds for disciplinary action. However, a request for
assistance shall not prevent the taking of appropriate disciplinary actions for
misconduct or performance problems which may be related to substance abuse. In
no case shall participation in the employee assistance program shield employees
who violate this policy from disciplinary action. Employees remain responsible
for their on-the-job conduct and work performance, although assistance for
substance abuse problems may be handled as a separate but related issue.
   (h)   Re-entry Contracts. Employees who re-enter the work force shall agree
to a re-entry contract. That contract may include, but is not limited to:
      (1)   A release to work statement from an approved treatment specialist.
(The medical review officer shall also approve the employee for return to work
in a “sensitive safety” position);
      (2)   A negative test for drugs and/or alcohol;
      (3)   An agreement to periodic testing;
      (4)   A statement of expected work-related behaviors; and
      (5)   An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for
termination.

Internal Revenue Service for the reimbursement of mileage.

274.01   ESTABLISHMENT; MEMBERSHIP; OFFICERS; EMPLOYEES; MEETINGS; FUNCTIONS.
   (a)   There is hereby established, in and for the Village, a Records
Commission, composed of the Mayor, or his or her appointed representative, as
Chairperson, and the Treasurer, the Solicitor and a citizen appointed by the
Mayor. The Commission shall appoint a Secretary, who may or may not be a member
of the Commission and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The
Commission may employ an archivist to serve under its direction. The Commission
shall meet at least once every six months and upon call of the Chairperson.
   (b)   The functions of the Commission shall be to provide rules for
retention and disposal of records of the Village and to review applications for
one-time records disposal and schedules of records retention and disposition
submitted by Municipal offices. Records may be disposed of by the Commission
pursuant to the procedure outlined in this section. The Commission may at any
time review any schedule it has previously approved, and for good cause shown
may revise that schedule.
   (c)   When Municipal records have been approved for disposal, a list of such
records shall be sent to the Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public
Offices of the Auditor of State. If the Bureau disapproves of the action by the
Municipal Commission, in whole or in part, it shall so inform the Commission
within a period of sixty days and these records shall not be destroyed. Before
public records are otherwise disposed of, the Ohio Historical Society shall be
informed and given the opportunity for a period of sixty days to select for its
custody or disposal such public records as it considers to be of continuing
historical value.
(ORC 149.39)
   (d)   When a position on the Records Commission becomes vacant, the Mayor
shall appoint the successor within 45 days of the creation of the vacancy,
subject to approval of the Legislative Authority for the unexpired term, or
full-term as the case may be. However, in the event the Mayor fails to make the
appointment within 45 days to fill the vacancy, Council may fill the vacancy by
a majority vote. The Mayor shall notify Council of the appointment within the
45- day time period to satisfy this provision. Council's failure to confirm any
appointment of the Mayor shall result in a new, 45-day time period for the
Mayor to present a new appointment. Where the outgoing commission member has
served with distinction and desires to continue their service to the Village,
the Mayor and Council shall reserve the right to give priority to that
applicant in considering their reappointment to another term. Letters of
interest may be completed and submitted to the Mayor by residents who are
interested in the open seat on the Records Commission. All letters of interest
will be open for public review.

with distinction and desires to continue their service to the Village, the
Mayor and Council shall reserve the right to give priority to that applicant in

   The Sundry Claims Board may receive original papers representing claims
filed against the Village. Such claims shall be filed on an application
prescribed from time to time by the Fiscal Officer and properly designated
either by number, or short title, or both. All such claims shall be carefully
investigated by such Board. The application shall be accompanied by a fee as
delineated in
Chapter 208 of the Codified Ordinances which shall be refunded to the applicant
if the claim is granted. The Chairman of the Board may administer oaths, compel
the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of books and papers. He
may punish for disobedience of subpoena, for refusal to be sworn or to answer
as a witness or for failure to produce books and papers, in the same manner as
officers authorized to take depositions. After such investigation, the Board
shall either approve, approve with conditions and limitations or disapprove,
each such claim and append to the original papers representing each claim a
concise statement of facts brought out in such investigation upon which its
approval or disapproval is based. Such original papers and appended statements
shall be filed in the office of the Fiscal Officer and delivered to the
Chairman of the Council Finance Committee at the next regular meeting of
Council. A copy of the appended statement shall be kept on file in the office
of the Fiscal Officer, together with the original papers representing such
claims and any other matters pertaining thereto, for a period of ten years.

in 2009, the Fiscal Officer shall estimate the cost of paying all the claims in
an amount of four thousand dollars ($4,000) or less to be allowed by the Sundry
Claims Board during the next succeeding year. He shall submit the estimate to
the Chairman of the Council Finance Committee to allow Council to appropriate
funds for the payment of claims in an amount of four thousand dollars ($4,000)
or less which may be allowed by the Board during the next succeeding year.

TITLE TEN - Judicial
            Chap.
290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Walton Hills has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Walton Hills ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Walton Hills, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2337.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to jury trial, then the magistrate shall
require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of
record in Cuyahoga County (the Garfield Heights Municipal Court), and the
magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript
of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to
the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury
trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a
jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further
limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his
or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his
or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Walton Hills ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas, " the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, mayors of mayor's courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.

or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the

(414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.
   For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking

      (2)   Prerequisites to system deployment. The Police Chief shall ensure
the requirements of R.C. § 4511.094 and R.C. § 4511.095 are met prior to
deploying any traffic law photo-monitoring device.
      (3)   System locations. Traffic law photo-monitoring devices may be

   (c)   Offense.
      (1)   Speeding violation; civil fine. The registered owner of a vehicle
that is recorded by a traffic law photo-monitoring device being operated at a
speed greater than the posted speed limit set forth in Section

         A.   Twelve to 15 miles per hour over the speed limit: $100.
         B.   Sixteen to 19 miles per hour over the speed limit: $150.
         C.   Twenty miles per hour or more over the speed limit: $200.
      (2)   Evidence of ownership. It is prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles,
or with any other State vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle
at the time of the offense set out in division (c)(1) of this section.
      (3)   Issuing ticket. Any ticket for a traffic violation set forth in
this section shall be issued in compliance with R.C. § 4511.096, as follows:
         A.   A Walton Hills police officer shall examine evidence of alleged
traffic law violations recorded by the system to determine whether a violation
has occurred. If the image(s) recorded by the traffic law photo-monitoring
device shows a violation, contains the date and time of the violation, and
shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the vehicle involved as
well as the state that issued the license plate, the officer may use any lawful
means to identify the registered owner.
         B.   Within 30 days of the traffic law violation, the Village or its
designee may issue and send by regular mail a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation.
         C.   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation,
sworn to or affirmed by a Walton Hills police officer, including by electronic
means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-monitoring
device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and is
admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this section.
      (4)   Content of ticket. Any ticket issued pursuant to this section shall
contain the following information, in accordance with R.C. § 4511.097:

to be sent;
         H.   A statement signed by a Walton Hills police officer indicating
that, based on an inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was involved
in a traffic law violation, and a statement indicating that the recorded images
are prima facie evidence of that traffic law violation both of which may be
signed electronically;
         I.   Information advising the person or entity alleged to be liable of
the options prescribed in division (d)(1) of this section, specifically to
include the time, place, and manner in which an administrative appeal may be
initiated and the procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an
affidavit as prescribed in that division;
         J.   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in division (d)(1) of this section is deemed to be an admission of liability
and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (5)   Payments; default fees. The amount of the penalty shall be paid
within 30 days from the mailing date of the ticket. If the amount of the
penalty is not paid within this time, twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be imposed
as a default fee. Failure to pay the penalty and the twenty dollar ($20.00)
default fee within 60 days from the date of mailing of the ticket will result
in the imposition of an additional twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee, bringing
the default fee to forty dollars ($40.00). Failure to pay the penalty and the
forty dollar ($40.00) default fee within 90 days from the date of mailing of
the ticket will result in an additional twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee,
bringing the default fee to the total amount of sixty dollars ($60.00), and the
unpaid penalty and default fee shall be forwarded for collection.
      (6)   Default and collection. Failure to timely elect and perform one of
the options contained in division (d)(1) of this section shall constitute an
admission of the violation and a waiver of the opportunity to contest the
violation. Further, if the registered owner or operator fails to pay the
penalty within the period set forth in division (c)(5) of this section, the
penalty, along with the additional late fee(s), may be collected by civil suit
or other appropriate means of collection.
      (7)   Other offenses and penalties not abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting Sections
414.03  or
434.03 , the criminal penalties imposed by those sections, or the ability of a
police officer to enforce those sections against any offender observed by the
officer violating either of those sections. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for any violation
of division (c)(1) of this section.
   (d)   Contesting Ticket.
      (1)   Options upon receipt of ticket. Consistent with R.C. § 4511.098, a
recipient of a ticket shall elect to do one of the following:
         A.   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
         B.   Within 30 days after receipt of the ticket, provide the Police
Chief with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within 48 hours
after the violation occurred.
         C.   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the Police Chief of the name and address
of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation. A motor vehicle leasing dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who
receives a ticket for an alleged traffic law violation detected by a traffic
law photo-monitoring device is not liable for a ticket issued for a motor
vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of a lessee or renter at the
time of the alleged violation. The dealer shall not pay such a ticket and
subsequently attempt to collect a fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge
for any payment of such a ticket made on behalf of the lessee or renter;
         D.   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the Police Chief an affidavit, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of
the corporate entity, that provides the name and address of the employee who
was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is
the designated party;
         E.   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the ticket. The person or entity shall file
the written request not later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket. The
failure to request a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of
the right to contest the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an
admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (2)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within 30 days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (d)(l)B.1. or 2. of this
section to the Police Chief in a form established by the Village and the
following conditions are met:
         A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(l)B.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request
an administrative hearing within 30 days or is determined liable in an
administrative hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (d)(l)B.2. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the Village timely receives an affidavit described in division
(d)(1)B.1. or (d)(1)D. of this section or a notification under division (d)
(1)C. of this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket
to the designated party. The Village shall send the ticket to the designated
party by ordinary mail not later than 21 days after receipt of the affidavit or
notification.
      (4)   Hearing; procedures.
         A.   When a person or entity named in a ticket elects to contest the
ticket and completes the requirements prescribed in division (d)(1)E. of this
section in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
            1.   A hearing officer appointed by the Village shall hear the
case. The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing not sooner than 21 but not
later than 45 days after the filing of a written request for the hearing. The
hearing officer may extend the time period by which a hearing must be conducted
upon a request for additional time by the person or entity who requested the
hearing.
            2.   The hearing officer shall ensure that the hearing is open to
the public. The hearing officer shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near
the entrance to the hearing room. The hearing officer shall identify on the
docket, by respondent, the hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each
hearing. The hearing officer may schedule multiple hearings for the same time
to allow for occurrences such as nonappearances or admissions of liability.
            3.   The person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the
hearing and may present evidence at the hearing.
            4.   The hearing officer shall determine whether a preponderance of
the evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact
occur and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
         B.   Determinations:
            1.   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the
person or entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a written
decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and
submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity named in the
ticket.
            2.   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact
occur but the person or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall
issue a written decision finding that the individual or entity is not liable
for the violation and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person
or entity named in the ticket.
            3.   If the person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity
named in the ticket.
            4.   The hearing officer shall render a decision on the day a
hearing takes place.
         C.   Considerations: The hearing officer may consider any of the
following as an affirmative defense to a traffic law violation provided herein:
            1.   The motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control
or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior to the
occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession of the
registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall
submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was
filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the traffic law
violation or within 48 hours after the traffic law violation occurred.
            2.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation,
the traffic law photo-monitoring device was not in proper position and the
recorded image is not of sufficient legibility to enable an accurate
determination of the information necessary to impose liability.
            3.   The registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. In
order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division, the
registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket shall provide to the
hearing officer the identity of the designated party, that person's name and
current address, and any other evidence that the hearing officer determines to
be pertinent.
            4.   The hearing officer also may consider the totality of the
circumstances when determining whether to impose liability upon the person or
entity named in the ticket.
         D.   If the hearing officer finds that the person or entity named in
the ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the hearing
officer shall provide to the Village or its designee, within five days of the
hearing, a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated
party.
         E.   Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the designated party,
the Village or its designee may issue a ticket to the designated party. The
Village shall send the ticket by ordinary mail not later than 21 days after
receipt of the evidence from the hearing officer or the registered owner of the
identity of the designated party.
         F.   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under this section
contests the ticket by filing a written request for an administrative hearing
to review the ticket not later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket, the
Village shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle also to attend
the hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the hearing
officer cannot determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The
hearing officer then shall issue a written decision imposing liability for the
violation on the registered owner and submit it to the Village or its designee
and to the registered owner. If the designated party also is a registered owner
of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of
registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
         G.   A person who is named in a ticket for a traffic violation under
this section may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with R.C. §
2317.02(D).
         H.   A person or entity may appeal a written decision rendered by a
hearing officer under this section to the Garfield Heights Municipal Court.
         I.   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of
liability under this section or R.C. § 4511.098, is admissible as evidence in
any other judicial proceeding in this state.

   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

not be used.

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the

of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made
in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at

be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician- paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. 
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the

sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).

distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall display the operator's driver's
license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
436.07 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 4507.02(B) -
(H)) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly. See Sections
436.071 through

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio
R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11,

offense for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other
sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section, or any
combination of three or more violations of this section or Ohio R.C. 4510.11,

court, in addition to any other sentence that it imposes on the offender, may
order the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle involved in the offense to the
State.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and 4507.02, as
applicable. The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered
under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Section
698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
or (b)(2) of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of
division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.11, 4510.111 or
4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree, and the offender shall provide the court with

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(ORC 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(B) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

      (1)   When permitted as specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.021, if the court
grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.

in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
State route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.

her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge a fee as set
forth in Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule), and
for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Department in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum set
forth in Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined

to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (c)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (d)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its

name and the date and place where it was exhibited to him or her. The law
enforcement officer may then permit such driver or operator to proceed without
weighing by a law enforcement officer. No person shall willfully issue a
written statement of gross vehicle weight and knowingly give any false

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

privilege, or made in connection with the person's appearance as a witness.
         D.   The Clerk of the Court shall pay every fine collected under

(ORC 4511.69)
452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the Police Chief shall allow the owner or operator of
the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Police Chief. If the Police Chief
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing
of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the

   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders

vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into

the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for

      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.

posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use

in a timely manner.

vital facilities of the Village.
   (b)   The Mayor or the Village Marshal (Chief of Police) shall make a
reasonable effort to announce the existence of the emergency by the use of the
local press and radio and television stations. Such emergency shall continue
until such time as the snow accumulation is reduced to less than two inches or
the Mayor or Village Marshal (Chief of Police) announces the emergency is
terminated. However, owners and operators of motor vehicles shall have the
responsibility of determining existing weather conditions and depth or extent
of snowfall, and to comply with emergency parking regulations when such
emergency is in effect.
   (c)   During the period of the emergency, the Mayor or Village Marshal
(Chief of Police) may prohibit the parking of vehicles upon any or all of the
Village streets. During such emergency no person shall park or cause to be
parked, or permit to be parked, or abandon or leave unattended any motor
vehicle of any kind or description on any of the Village's streets or roads.
However, vehicles may be parked for a period of not longer than five minutes
for the actual loading or unloading of passengers, or of property or goods,
provided that the operator of such vehicle is immediately available, and
provided further that no other ordinance restricting parking as to time and
place is violated.
   (d)   All Village streets are designed as snow emergency streets, a sign
will be posed at all entrances to the Village stating the same. Any motor
vehicle parked in violation of this section shall be towed to a place
designated by the Mayor or Village Marshal (Chief of Police), at the owner's
expense.
   (e)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under Federal law.
   (d)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (f)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (i)   As used in this section, "computer," "computer system," "computer
network," "information service," "telecommunication," "telecommunications
device," "telecommunications service," "data" and "writing" have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
606.12   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13   SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider

keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the

determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.15 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the

nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that §

by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The

portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

672.03   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

672.04   DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of
Section
672.01 or Section
672.02 is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law if the property
involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies
the account on which it is to be drawn, and that has not been executed by the
drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer's or
importer's certificate to a motor vehicle, as prescribed by Ohio R.C. 4505.07;

presented the renter with identification that was materially false, fictitious,
or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment, or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee's agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima facie evidence
that the person in possession or control of the meter, conduit or attachment at
the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to this
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

   a.   Any residence or building, or part thereof, located within the Village
may be equipped with an alarm system for the purpose of detecting and signaling
the presence of fire or unauthorized intrusion.

Mayor approve such application, in writing, then a permit may be issued. The
Chief and the Mayor shall prescribe the form of the application and request
such information as is necessary to evaluate and act upon the permit
application. The information contained in an alarm permit application shall be

Mayor.
   c.   An alarm permit fee as set forth in
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule) shall be

Mayor for a violation by the permittee of any of the provisions of this
chapter, for failure to properly maintain an installation, or when the number

experience.
   (b)   No person shall use or cause to be used any telephone device or
telephone attachment that automatically selects a telephone line allocated by
the telephone company to the Village or any of its departments or divisions,
except a telephone line which is specifically designated by the Mayor for such

for revocation of the alarm permit.
   (c)   The Chief, upon written approval of the Mayor, may require that
repairs or adjustments be made to an alarm system whenever he or she determines
that such are necessary to ensure proper operation. Failure to make such
repairs or adjustments may be grounds for revocation of the alarm permit.

812.01   REGULATION OF BASIC CABLE TELEVISION RATES.
   The Village hereby adopts, by this chapter, the rate regulation rules
promulgated by the FCC pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 ("1992 Cable Act"), 47 C.F.R., Part 76, Subpart N. The
determination of the lawfulness of any cable television rate within the
Village's jurisdiction will be made pursuant to these FCC rules or any
successor FCC regulations. All terms used herein have the same meaning and
application as in the FCC's cable rate regulation rules.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.02   ESTABLISHMENT AND DUTIES OF CABLE REGULATORY STAFF.
   (a)   A cable regulatory staff ("the Staff") for the Village will be
organized by the Mayor with the assistance, as desired, of the Cuyahoga County
Mayors and Managers Association, in order to administer the regulation of basic
cable service and equipment rates pursuant to the FCC's cable rate regulations
and the 1992 Cable Act, with the aid of counsel and other consultants as may be
needed. The Council may at any time delegate additional duties to the Staff.
   (b)   In all instances involving the determination of the lawfulness of a
cable television service rate or rates, the Staff will present to the Council a
recommended decision based on the record. The Council may adopt, amend or
remand for further review a recommended decision of the Staff. The Council may
also direct the Staff at any time to investigate issues pertaining to cable
rate regulation and provide a recommended decision. Any adoption by the Council
of any recommended decision by the Staff regarding the lawfulness of a cable
television service rate or rates shall be considered a final decision. The
Staff shall communicate the results of final decisions to the affected cable
operators in writing.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.03   COMPUTATION OF TIME.
   This section only applies to time periods that need to be computed for
participation in cable rate regulation proceedings administered by the Staff or
the Council.
   (a)   The term "day" shall apply to all days, regardless of holidays.
   (b)   The term "business day" means all days which are not "holidays."
   (c)   If the date for any event specified in these rules falls on a holiday,
the relevant date will be the next business day.
   (d)   The term "holiday" means Saturday, Sunday, officially recognized legal
holidays and any other day on which the Staff offices are not open. For
example, a regularly scheduled Staff business day may become a "holiday" if its
offices are closed for all or part of regular working hours due to adverse
weather or emergency conditions.
   (e)   The first day to be counted in any period of time is the day after the
event which initiates the period. For example, if comments are to be filed
within five days of a public notice issued on November 12, the deadline for
filing the comments would be November 17.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.04   EFFECTIVE DATE OF RATE REGULATION FOR BASIC SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.910(e)(2) and § 76.922, the initial date of
regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which local notice
is given to the cable operator that the provision of the basic service tier is
subject to rate regulation. This local notice will be in the form of a letter
sent by the Staff to the cable operator.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.05   INITIATION OF REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT RATES.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.930(a), a cable operator shall file its schedule
of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the Staff
within thirty days of receiving written notification from the Staff that the
Village has been certified by the FCC to regulate rates for the basic service
tier. To comply with this provision, a cable operator must file a Form 393
regarding rates that were charged since September 1, 1993, or one year prior to
the commencement of the Village's rate regulation, whichever is the shorter
period, and a second Form 393 regarding any proposed rate increases.

provide interested parties, upon request, with copies of the Form 393 and any
related materials filed with the Staff.
   (d)   After the Staff issues the public notice described in subsections (a)
through (c) hereof, interested parties will have five business days to file
written comments with the Staff. There is no prescribed format for these
comments.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.07   STAFF AND COUNCIL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES AND EQUIPMENT COSTS.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(a), after a cable operator has
submitted for review its existing or past rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including
increases in the baseline channel change that results from reductions in the
number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the
proposed rates will become effective after thirty days from the date of
submission, provided, however, that the Staff may toll this thirty-day deadline
for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in
subsection (b) hereof within thirty days of the rate submission explaining that
it needs additional time to review the rates.
   (b)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(b), if the Staff is unable to
determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the
past, existing or proposed rates are within the FCC's permitted basic service
tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in 47 C.F.R. §§ 76.922 and
76.923, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant
to 47 C.F.R. §§ 76.937(c) and 76.924, seeking to justify a rate above the FCC's
basic service tier charge as defined in 47 C.F.R. §§ 76.922 and 76.923, then
the Staff may toll the thirty-day deadline set forth in subsection (a) hereof
to request and consider additional information or to consider the comments from
interested parties as follows:
      (1)   For an additional ninety days in cases not involving cost-of-
service showings, for a total of 120 days from the filing by the cable operator
of the Form 393; or
      (2)   For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service
showings, for a total of 180 days from the filing by the cable operator of the
Form 393.
   (c)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(c), if the Staff has availed itself of
the additional ninety or 150-days permitted under subsection (b) hereof,
whichever is applicable, and has taken no action within these additional time
periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the ninety
or 150-day periods, whichever is applicable, or, if no new rates have been
proposed, then the existing rates will remain in effect at such times. All
rates allowed into effect under this subsection will remain subject to refunds
if the Staff subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of
such rates, provided, however, that in order to order refunds, the Staff must
have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the
ninety or 150-day period permitted under subsection (b) hereof, whichever is
applicable, directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were
paid.
   (d)   If the Staff does not seek additional time, the Staff will, within the
thirty-day deadline, submit a recommended decision to the Council about the
reasonableness of the cable operator's rates. If, within the thirty-day period,
the Council does not act upon the Staff's recommended decision, then the
recommended decision will be considered a final decision.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.08   ADDITIONAL TIME FOR REVIEW OF RATES FOR BASIC SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   If the Staff has availed itself of the additional ninety or 150 days
permitted in 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(b), whichever is applicable, then the Staff
shall publish a schedule for the issuance of a recommended decision within the
additional time and for the submission of comments by interested parties.
   (b)   Thirty days before the ninetieth day or the 150th day, whichever is
applicable, the Staff shall publish a draft of its recommended decision.
Interested parties will then have five business days to file comments with the
Staff regarding the recommended decision.
   (c)   Upon the expiration of the comment period set forth in subsection (b)
hereof, the record for the cable rate regulation proceeding will close. The
Council will then have an opportunity to review the recommended decision and
any comments or documents filed in the rate proceeding. Nothing in this
subsection prohibits the Council from reviewing the Staff's draft recommended
decision or documents filed with the Staff at any time.
   (d)   If the Council does not act upon the Staff's recommended decision by
the ninetieth or the 150th day, whichever is applicable, then the recommended
decision will be considered the final decision.
   (e)   Within the ninety or 150-day period, whichever is applicable, the
Council may remand the recommended decision to the Staff for further review
based on the Council's recommendations.
   (f)   If the period for additional review by the Staff extends beyond the
applicable period specified in subsection (a) hereof, then the proposed rates
will go into effect at the end of the ninety or 150-day period, whichever is
applicable, or, if no new rates have been proposed, then the existing rates
will remain in effect at such times. All rates allowed into effect under this
subsection will remain subject to refunds in the event that the Staff
subsequently issues a written decision, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(c),
disapproving any portion of such rates.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.09   SMALL SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.934, the Council may permit a small system,
as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 76.901, to certify that the small system's rates for
basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 C.F.R. § 76.922.
   (b)   A system seeking the certification described in subsection (a) hereof
must file a petition to this effect with the Staff.
   (c)   Within a reasonable time of receiving such a petition, the Staff shall
issue a public notice, as described in Section
812.06, stating that it has received such a petition. The notice will provide
the address of the Staff office where the petition will be available for public
viewing within specified times. The notice will also provide the address and
telephone number of the cable operator. The cable operator is required to
provide interested parties with copies of the petition. In addition, the notice
will also provide a date for the presentation of a recommended decision by the
Staff to the Council and shall set a date by which the Council must act upon
the recommended decision, which shall be at least thirty days after the
submission of the Staff's recommended decision. If the Council takes no action
by the date designated by the Staff, then the recommended decision shall be
considered a final decision.

hereof, interested parties will have five business days to file written
comments with the Staff. There is no prescribed format for these comments.

rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part,
disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or approves a
request for an increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested
parties. In the event that the Council has taken action which constitutes a
final decision of such nature, the written decision will not issue until
approved by Council. The Staff is not required to issue a written decision that
approves an unopposed past, existing or proposed rate for the basic service
tier or associated equipment. The written decision may follow the announcement
of a final decision by a period not to exceed thirty days, unless additional
time is necessary for Council approval as required in this section.

812.11   PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.938, the Staff may require the production of
proprietary information by the cable operator to make a rate determination and
in such cases the Staff will devise and apply procedures analogous to those set
forth in 47 C.F.R. § 0.459 regarding requests for confidentiality. If no
request for confidentiality is made, or if the Staff denies a request for
confidentiality, the information will be made available for public inspection
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43. A cable operator may appeal to the Council a
denial by the Staff of a request for confidentiality. The material which is
subject to the request for confidentiality will not be made available for
public inspection pending a Council decision on the request.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.12   FORFEITURES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.943(a), Council hereby authorizes the Mayor to
impose a civil monetary forfeiture on any cable operator that does not comply
with a rate decision or a refund order directed specifically at the cable
operator. In his or her decision to impose such a forfeiture, the Mayor may

decision or refund order, the amount of the refund or rate reduction, and the
intentional or unintentional nature of the noncompliance. Such forfeitures may
be imposed pursuant to the following schedule:

the date of the communication to the cable operator of the written decision
ordering such rate reduction or refund: ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

   (b)   For a past, existing or proposed rate for basic tier service or
associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost

Council and the Staff.
(Ord. 1993-34. Passed 12-7-93.)
812.15   CHANGE IN STATUS OF CABLE OPERATOR.
   (a)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.915, a cable operator may petition the
Village for a change in its regulatory status based on a showing of effective
competition. The operator bears the burden of proving the existence of
effective competition.
   (b)   Within a reasonable time of receiving a cable operator's petition for
a change in regulatory status, the Staff shall issue a public notice stating
that the Village has received such a petition. The notice will contain a date
for the presentation of a recommended decision by the Staff to the Council. The
notice will also contain the address of the Staff office where the operator's
petition will be available for public viewing within specified times. The
notice will also provide the name and address of the cable operator. The cable
operator is required to provide interested parties with copies of the petition
upon request.
   (c)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.915(a), oppositions to the operator's

for the presentation of a recommended decision to the Council. Pursuant to 47
C.F.R. § 76.915(b), decisions on petitions for change in status must be made
within thirty days after the pleading cycle set forth in subsections (b) and
(c) hereof closes. The Staff must notify the FCC within ten days of any
decision changing regulatory status. Unless the FCC receives an opposition to
such change in status, the decision will become effective thirty days after
adoption by the Council.
   (e)   Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.915(c), if there is a final determination
by the Council that effective competition exists, then the Council and the
Staff will cease regulating basic cable service rates. A final determination
that there is no effective competition may be appealed to the FCC pursuant to
the FCC's rules.

814.01   AUTHORITY; FINDINGS; INTENT.
   (a)   The Village, pursuant to applicable Federal and State law, is
authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, own,
operate, maintain and reconstruct cable television systems within the Village
limits.
   (b)   The Village Council finds that the development of cable television
systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents
of the Village. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology
associated with cable television, the Village Council further finds that the
public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing, to the extent permitted by State and Federal law, regulatory
powers which should be vested in the Village or in such persons as the Village
shall designate.
   (c)   It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide
for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable television service
to the public, and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

   (a)   This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all
applicable Federal and State laws.
   (b)   In the event that the State or Federal government discontinues
preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently
exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal
regulatory authority, the grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and

notify the grantees of its intent to adopt rules and regulations in writing at
least thirty days prior to the adoption of the rules and regulations.
   (c)   This chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after
the effective date of this chapter.
   (d)   The grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the Village

(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)

   (a)   The grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise and/or the cable system or any
of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the prior consent
of the Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and
shall be denied only upon a good faith finding by the Village that the proposed
transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform
its obligations under the franchise agreement, and then only upon such
reasonable terms and conditions as the grantor may require. Any attempt to
sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or the
cable system without the consent of the Council shall be null and void. This
provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal
course of business. No consent from the Village shall be required for a
transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or
in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a
corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with the grantee.
   (b)   The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other
transfer of the franchise and/or the cable system requiring compliance with
this section:
      (1)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of the
grantee's assets;
      (2)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in the grantee by one or more
of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in the grantee;
      (3)   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by the grantee so as to create a new controlling
interest in the grantee; and
      (4)   The entry by the grantee into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of the grantee and/or the system.
   The term "controlling interest" as used herein means majority equity
ownership of the grantee.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided below, or unless waived by the grantor as
provided under Section
814.35, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a franchise and/
or a cable system prior to the substantial completion of the initial design or
initial construction of said system by the grantee. In the case of a sale of
multiple systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently
transfer ownership of one or more such systems to one or more third parties,
such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above-
described holding period shall not apply to:
      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable
system which is not subject to Federal income tax liability;
      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency,
any State or political subdivision or the Village; or
      (3)   Any sale, assignment or transfer to one or more purchasers,
assignees or transferees controlling, controlled by or under common control
with the seller, assignor or transferor or its affiliate.
   (d)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/
or cable system, the Village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for
approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such
information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications Commission
regulations, the requirements of this chapter and such other reasonable
information as the Village, in its sole discretion, may request. During the
review period, the grantor may advise the grantee that a public hearing is
deemed necessary to evaluate any potential adverse effect of the sale or
transfer upon the grantee's subscribers. In such event, the grantee shall
receive written notice of the hearing and of the opportunity to participate
fully in it, as far in advance as possible, but in no event less than fourteen
days prior to the start of the hearing. If the Village fails to render a final
decision on the request within 120 days from receipt by the Village of all
required information, such request shall be deemed granted, unless the
requesting party and the Village agree to an extension of time. Such request to
transfer may be conditioned upon the performance of additional requirements
imposed upon the grantee by the grantor, and the payment of a nonrefundable
transfer fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)   The grantee shall notify the grantor in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property
of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or
a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of
the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this section governing the
consent of the grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply.
   (f)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking the grantor's
consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee shall have the
responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes an application in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the grantor, which application shall
include the information required under State and Federal law as well as under
Section
814.13(b). An application, acceptable to the Village, shall be submitted to the
grantor not less than ninety days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee
shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and
financial qualifications to operate and maintain the system and to comply with
all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If,
after considering the legal, technical and financial qualifications and the
character of the applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, the
grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, the grantor shall transfer and
assign the rights and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the grantor
to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied.
   (g)   The consent or approval of the grantor to transfer by the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor in or to
its public rights-of-way or easements, and any transfer shall by its own terms
be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement. A sale, transfer or assignment of the franchise may not be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the
franchise agreement.
   (h)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee
satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable
television system in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within thirty days of assuming such control, which plan will
insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during
the term that the financial institution exercises control over the system. The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period
exceeding one year, unless extended by the grantor in its discretion, and
during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to
transfer the franchise to another grantee.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.09   PURCHASE BY VILLAGE.
   (a)   The grantor may, at any time, offer to purchase the grantee's cable
system for the same consideration and according to the same terms that it is
willing to accept from any person. The grantee shall have thirty days from
receipt of the offer from the grantor within which to accept the offer.
   (b)   In any case where the grantor elects to purchase the system, the
purchase shall be closed within sixty days of the date of the grantor's audit
of a current profit and loss statement of the grantee.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.10   GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE; MULTIPLE DWELLING UNITS (MDUs).
   (a)   The grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television
system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit, school, library and
Municipal building in the service area, subject to any line extension
requirements of the franchise agreement.
   (b)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any part of the service area, the grantee shall provide
cable service to any non-commercial subscriber requesting a standard

service in a part of the Village in which a franchise has already been granted,
and where an existing grantee is providing service, shall require the new

such circumstances, the cable operator shall attempt to contact the customer
within forty-eight hours.
         C.   Residential service interruptions.

            2.   If a customer experiences poor video or audio reception
attributable to the cable operator's equipment, the cable operator shall repair

         E.   Treatment of property.
            1.   The cable operator shall keep trimming to a minimum. Trees and

give reasonable notice to property owners or legal tenants prior to entering
upon private premises, and the notice shall specify the work to be performed,
provided that in the case of construction operations, such notice shall be
delivered or provided at least twenty-four hours prior to entry. Nothing herein
shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private property, or any
other property, where such right to access or entry is not otherwise provided
by law. If damage is caused by any cable operator activity, the cable operator
shall reimburse the property owner 100 percent of the cost of the damage or
replace the damaged property. For the installation of pedestals or other major
construction or installation projects, property owners shall also be notified

cost of the service, repair or installation orally prior to delivery of the
service or before any work is performed, and shall provide the customer with an
oral statement of the total charges before terminating the telephone call or
before leaving the location at which the work was performed.
      (5)   Customer privacy. 
         A.   The cable operator shall not monitor cable television signals to

activity related to a cable service or other service provided by the cable
operator to its customers.
      (6)   Billing. 
         A.   Bills will be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be
fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and
premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills will also clearly

service is terminated.
         D.   Credits for service will be issued no later than the customer's
next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted.
      (7)   Complaint procedures.
         A.   Any verbal, telephonic or written complaint relating to the
quality or continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service
interval. In the event that such complaints are not responded to or service is
not restored to the levels required by the FCC or by the terms of this chapter
during said normal service interval, the subscriber shall be entitled to a
rebate of his or her monthly service charge or twenty dollars ($20.00),
whichever is greater, for the missed appointment. This provision shall not
apply if such delay is occasioned because of an act of God, a strike, a
national emergency or any other circumstance beyond the control of the cable
operator. Similarly, this provision shall not apply to service requests or
complaints pertaining to television set malfunction or any other breakdown not
related to the operation of the cable television system. The Village Complaint
Officer, provided for in paragraph (c)(7)C. hereof, shall be responsible for
invoking said penalty upon receiving a written subscriber complaint. The
Complaint Officer shall hold a hearing on such complaint, to be conducted in
the manner prescribed in and otherwise governed by paragraph (c)(7)C. hereof.
         B.   The cable operator shall establish procedures for receiving,
acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints. The cable operator shall
furnish a notice of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial
subscription to the system. In addition, the cable operator shall maintain a
written record, printout or log, listing dates and times of customer
complaints, identifying the subscriber and describing the nature of the
complaints and when and what action was taken by the cable operator in response
thereto. Such records shall be kept for a period of three years at the cable
operator's local office, reflecting the operations to date, subject to
applicable laws regarding subscriber privacy, and shall be available for
inspection during regular business hours.
         C.   The Mayor or a designee shall serve as the Village Complaint
Officer, with primary responsibility for the continuing administration of
complaint procedures hereunder. Any subscriber, user, programmer or other
interested person who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television
service, equipment malfunctions, billings or any other matter, which remains
unresolved for thirty days after it has been brought to the cable operator's
attention, may file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon
the filing of such a complaint, said Complaint Officer shall notify the cable
operator and make an investigation to determine whether or not there is
probable cause to credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines
after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations
of the complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and the
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion. In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain
conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a
hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will
be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within thirty days thereafter, either
the cable operator or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing,
the decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Officer. The affirmance, rejection or modification of
said decision by the Council shall be final.
         D.   Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there
exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Officer
shall have the right and authority to compel the cable operator to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be
delivered to the Complaint Officer no later than fourteen days after said
Officer formally notifies the cable operator and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests,
what system component(s) were tested; the equipment used; procedures employed
in resolving said complaints, if applicable; and any and all additional
information deemed relevant by the Complaint Officer.
         E.   Said tests and analyses shall be supervised by a registered
professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the cable operator and
selected by the Village. The aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of
special tests and forward to the Complaint Officer such records with a report
interpreting the results of the tests and recommending action to be taken by
the Village.
         F.   The cable operator shall notify each subscriber at the time of
initial installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer
and of the procedures contained in this section.
   (d)   Customer Dissatisfaction With Any Service. Any customer who requests
disconnection of cable service or of any particular programming service
previously ordered shall have disconnection effective on the day such request
is made. The customer will not be charged thereafter for any service
disconnected and, in the case of a service for which the customer has prepaid,
the customer shall promptly be provided a credit for, or sent a refund of, the
unused portion of the prepaid amount.
   (e)   Safety. The cable operator shall install and locate its facilities,
cable system and equipment in compliance with all Federal, State, local and
company safety standards, and in such manner as shall not unduly interfere with
or endanger persons or property. Whenever the cable operator receives notice
that an unsafe condition exists with respect to its equipment, the cable
operator shall investigate such condition immediately and shall take such
measures as are necessary to remove or eliminate such unsafe condition.

regulation provisions provided for herein and those of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N. The
Village shall follow the rules relating to cable rate regulation promulgated by
the FCC at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N.
   (b)   The grantee shall offer a senior citizen discount to all eligible
subscribers, upon proof of age, as specified in the franchise agreement. Such
discount may be added into the rate regulation calculation as a requirement of
the franchise.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall prohibit the grantee from offering discounts or
other promotions to other subscribers.
   (d)   Nothing herein shall prohibit the temporary reduction or waiving of
rates or charges in conjunction with valid promotional campaigns.
   (e)   The grantee shall offer broadcast basic service, which will consist

814.19   FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   Following the issuance and acceptance of a franchise, and as
compensation for the benefits and privileges granted under the franchise, and
in consideration of permission to use the grantor's street and rights-of-way,
the grantee shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee based upon the grantee's
annual gross revenues in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (b)   The grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished with a statement
within 120 days of the close of the calendar year, certified by an officer of
the grantee or audited by a certified public accountant, reflecting and
attesting to the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all payments and
computations for the previous calendar year. At any time and upon thirty days
prior written notice, and no more than once per calendar year, the grantor
shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of the grantee's records,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and if such audit
indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or more, the grantee
shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or any franchise agreement or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
   (d)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is
not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, the
grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from
such due date, at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate plus one and
one-half percent during the period for which payment was due.
   (e)   In the event any payment is not received within thirty calendar days
from its due date, the grantee shall further be assessed an additional amount,
with regard to the payment, as set forth in
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule). In the event
any payment is not received within seventy-five calendar days from its due
date, the grantee shall be assessed an additional amount, with regard to the
payment, as set forth in
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule). The
grantee's liability for such amount in such cases shall not be subject to, but
shall be in addition to, the remedies set forth in Section
814.20 for franchise violations and may be taken from the performance bond in
accordance with Section
814.25.
   (f)   Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule
indicated in the franchise agreement and shall be accompanied by a report in
summarized form of the grantee's gross receipts during the period and the
computation of the payment amount upon which revenues shall be listed by
category, including, but not limited to, subscription revenues (such as basic
and pay services), nonrecurring revenues (such as pay-per-view) and
nonsubscriber revenues (such as advertising).
   (g)   The grantor represents that it is its intention to be able to charge
up to the maximum amount of franchise fees allowed by law, which is presently
set at five percent. This maximum may be amended during the term of the
franchise by any higher maximum amount that may be set by FCC regulations or
the Cable Act, as the same may be amended from time to time. The grantor may
change the percentage to be set forth in the franchise agreement by ordinance
or resolution of the grantor's Council and upon written notice to the grantee,
as long as the same does not exceed the maximum amount the grantor is
authorized to collect as allowed by law at the time of the change and as long
as the grantor collects the same percentage from all other cable operators
operating a cable television system in the franchise area. The grantee shall
implement the change within sixty days of written notice of the same by the
grantor.
   (h)   No term or condition in this chapter or the franchise agreement shall
in any way modify or affect the grantee's obligation to pay franchise fees.
Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set
forth elsewhere in this chapter or in the franchise agreement may total more
than the maximum allowable percentage of the grantee's gross revenues in any
twelve-month period, the grantee agrees that the additional commitments are not
franchise fees as defined under any Federal law, nor are they to be offset or
credited against any franchise fee payments due to the grantor, nor do they
represent an increase in franchise fees to be itemized as such on the
subscriber's bill.
   (i)   Payment of the franchise fee under this chapter or the franchise
agreement shall not exempt the grantee from the payment of any other license
fee, tax, levy, assessment or charge on the business, occupation, services,
property or income of the grantee which is or may hereafter be lawfully imposed
on all entities engaged in the same business as the grantee.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.20   DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS; STREET AND OTHER PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Construction.  
      (1)   Subject to applicable laws, regulations and ordinances of the
grantor and the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, the
grantee may perform all construction necessary for the operation of its cable
system. All construction and maintenance of any and all facilities within
streets incident to the grantee's cable system shall, regardless of who
performs the construction, be and remain the grantee's responsibility. The
grantee shall apply for, and obtain, all generally applicable permits necessary
for construction or installation of any facilities, and for excavating and
laying any facilities, within the streets. The grantee shall pay all applicable
fees upon the issuance of the requisite construction permits by the grantor to
the grantee.
      (2)   Prior to beginning any construction, the grantee shall provide the
grantor with a construction schedule for work in the streets. When the
grantee's construction of facilities in the streets is completed, the grantee
shall provide the grantor with a map showing the location of the installed
facility in the streets, as built, in detail, excluding proprietary
electronics. All as-builts shall be available at the grantee's local office for
inspection.
      (3)   The grantee may make excavations in streets for any facility needed
for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. Prior to doing
such work, the grantee shall apply for, and obtain, generally applicable
permits from the grantor, and give appropriate notices to any other
franchisees, licensees or permittees of the grantor, or bureaus of the grantor,
or other units of government owning or maintaining pipes, wires, conduits or
other facilities which may be affected by the proposed excavation.
      (4)   In the event that emergency repairs are necessary, the grantee
shall immediately notify the grantor of the need for such repairs. The grantee
may initiate such emergency repairs and shall apply for appropriate permits
within forty-eight hours after discovery of the emergency. The grantee shall
comply with all applicable grantor regulations relating to such excavations or
construction, including the payment of permit or license fees.
   (b)   Location of Facilities. 
      (1)   Within forty-eight hours after any grantor franchisee, licensee or
permittee notifies the grantee of a proposed street excavation, the grantee
shall, at the grantee's expense:
         A.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground facilities
within the area of the proposed excavation;
         B.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities in
the area of the proposed excavation; or
         C.   Notify the excavator that the grantee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
      (2)   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the grantee's plant was cut for
whatever reason, then the grantor's franchisee, licensee or permittee shall be
required to notify the grantee and pay for the repair of the grantee's plant.
   (c)   Restoration of Streets. 
      (1)   Whenever the grantee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the grantee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition. When any opening is made by the grantee in a hard surface pavement
in any street, such grantee shall promptly refill the opening and restore the
surface to a condition reasonably satisfactory to the grantor.
      (2)   If the grantee excavates the surface of any street, such grantee
shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface within the
area affected by the excavation in accordance with applicable regulations of
the Village. The grantor may, after providing notice and an opportunity to
correct to the grantee, refill and/or repave any opening made by the grantee in
the street, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the grantee. The grantor
may, after providing notice and an opportunity to correct to the grantee,
remove and/or repair any work done by the grantee which, in the determination
of the grantor, is inadequate. The cost thereof, including the costs of
inspection and supervision, shall be paid by the grantee. All excavations made
by the grantee in the streets shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention
of accidents. All of the grantee's work under the franchise agreement and this
chapter, and this section in particular, shall be done in strict compliance
with all rules, regulations and ordinances of the grantor.
   (d)   Maintenance and Workmanship. 
       (1)   The grantee's cable system shall be constructed and maintained in
such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes or any other property
of the grantor, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures
or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by, or under, the
grantor authority.
       (2)   The grantee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the grantee's signals so as to prevent injury to
the grantor's property or property belonging to any person. The grantee, at its
own expense, shall repair, renew, change and improve its facilities as listed
above in good repair and in a safe and presentable condition.
   (e)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon the grantee's acquisition of cable-
related facilities in any grantor street, or upon the addition or annexation to
the grantor of any area in which the grantee owns or operates any cable related
facility, the grantee shall, at the grantor's request, submit to the grantor a
statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise,
permit, license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent that the grantee has possession of such information.
Such facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of the franchise
agreement.
   (f)   Reservation of Grantor Streets Rights. Nothing in the franchise
agreement or this chapter, shall prevent the grantor or public utilities owned,
maintained and/or operated by public entities other than the grantor from
constructing sewers; grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any street;
laying down, repairing or removing water mains; or constructing or establishing
any other public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as
practicable, so as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the use and operation of
the grantee's cable system. However, if any of the grantee's system interferes
with the construction or repair of any street or public improvement, including
construction, repair or removal of a sewer or water main, such portion of the
grantee's system shall be removed or replaced in the manner the grantor shall
reasonably direct, and the grantor shall in no event be liable for any damage
to any portion of grantee's cable system. Any and all such removal or
replacement shall be at the expense of the grantee. Should the grantee fail to
remove, adjust or relocate its facilities by the date established by the
grantor's written notice to the grantee, the grantor may effect such removal,
adjustment or relocation, and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by
the grantee, including all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
grantor due to the grantee's delay.
   (g)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the grantee
is vacated by the grantor during the term of the franchise, then unless the
grantor specifically reserves to the grantee the right to continue its
installation in the vacated street, the grantee shall, without delay or expense
to the grantor, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities in such street,
restore, repair or reconstruct the street where removal has occurred, and
replace the street to the condition in which it was found. In the event of
failure, neglect or refusal of the grantee, after a time period to be
negotiated by the grantor and grantee, to restore, repair or reconstruct such
street, the grantor may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost
thereof may be collected by the grantor from the performance bond pursuant to
Section
814.25(c).
   (h)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever the grantee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the grantee shall submit for
the grantor's approval a complete description of the facility and the date on
which the grantee intends to discontinue using the facility. The grantee may
remove the facility or request that the grantor permit it to remain in place.
Notwithstanding the grantee's request that any such facility remain in place,
the grantor may require the grantee to remove the facility from above the
street or modify the facility to protect the public health, welfare, safety and
convenience, or otherwise serve the public interest. The grantor may require
the grantee to perform a combination of modification and removal of any such
above-ground facility. The grantee shall complete such removal or modification
in accordance with a schedule set by the grantor. Until such time as the
grantee removes or modifies the facility as directed by the grantor, or until
the rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility, the grantee
shall be responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility,
as well as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the
facility were in active use, and the grantee shall retain all liability for
such facility.
   (i)   Hazardous Substances.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable State and Federal
laws, statutes, regulations, the National Electrical Safety Code, and orders
concerning hazardous substances, relating to the grantee's cable system in the
streets.
      (2)   The grantee shall maintain and inspect its cable system located in
the streets. Upon reasonable notice to the grantee, the grantor may inspect the
grantee's facilities in the streets to determine if any release of hazardous
substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the grantee's cable
system. In removing or modifying the grantee's facilities as provided in the
franchise agreement or this chapter, the grantee shall also remove all residue
of hazardous substances related thereto.
      (3)   The grantee agrees to forever indemnify the grantor against any
claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, whether direct or indirect, incurred
by the grantor arising out of release of hazardous substances caused by the
grantee's cable system in the streets.
   (j)   Undergrounding of Cable. Existing facilities of the grantee's and
existing portions of the grantee's cable system shall be placed underground at
the grantee's expense when other utilities in the same rights-of-way place
their facilities underground or when required of all utilities and persons by
general ordinances of the grantor or applicable State or Federal law.
   (k)   Construction Codes. The grantee shall strictly adhere to all building
and zoning codes currently or hereafter in effect. The grantee shall arrange
its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on both public and private property,
in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with the use of said
public or private property by any person. In the event of such interference,
the grantor may require the removal or relocation of the grantee's lines,
cables and other appurtenances from the property in question.
   (l)   Construction and Use of Poles. 
      (1)   Whenever feasible, the construction, maintenance and use of the
grantee's cable system shall comply with the standards of materials in
engineering and all other provisions of a pole user agreement for use of poles,
entered into by and between other pole users and the grantee. In the event that
the grantee cannot obtain the necessary poles and allied facilities pursuant to
the provisions of such an agreement, and only in such event, then it shall be
lawful for the grantee to make all needed excavations in the streets for the
purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. All
poles of the grantee shall be erected between the curb and the sidewalk, unless
otherwise designated by the proper grantor authorities, and each pole shall be
set whenever practicable at an extension lot line. The grantor shall have the
right to require the grantee to change the location of any grantee-owned pole,
conduit, structure or other facility within the streets when, in the opinion of
the grantor, the public convenience requires such change, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the grantee.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall exempt the grantee from compliance with all
Charter and ordinance provisions relating to such excavations or construction,
or with any provision requiring payment of permit or license fees pertaining
thereto.
   (m)   System Design. The grantee's cable system shall comply with the design
and service requirements and schedules to be contained in the franchise
agreement, the exhibits attached to the franchise agreement and all applicable
laws and regulations. All of the grantee's construction and design shall be
subject to the grantor's supervision and control, including, without
limitation, the location of facilities, the placement of poles and the decision
to underground any facilities. The grantee shall submit construction drawings
and specifications for approval on all projects.
   (n)   Geographical Coverage. The grantee shall design and construct its
cable system in such manner as to have the capability to connect and provide
cable service to every single-family dwelling unit, multiple-family dwelling
unit, school, library and Municipal agency within the franchise area, provided
that any other cable provider should be required to do the same.
   (o)   System Upgrade Schedule. 
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with the requirements of the system
upgrade schedule to be contained in an exhibit of the franchise agreement.
      (2)   No less than thirty days prior to the start of construction in the
franchise area, the grantee shall meet all applicable design and construction
standards of the grantor and shall provide a detailed construction progress
schedule and area construction maps. In addition, the grantee shall update this
information upon request by the grantor on a quarterly basis, by submitting a
copy of its normal internal progress reports, showing specifically whether
schedules are being met and the reasons for any delay.
   (p)   Installation of New Cable System Underground. All new or upgrade cable
system facilities shall be installed underground where existing undergrounded
utility facilities exist, but may be installed on existing utility poles where
aerial facilities currently exist. In areas where no poles exist, the grantee
shall place its facilities underground, and the grantee shall move existing
facilities underground whenever all other utilities go underground.
   (q)   Prewiring. Any law of the grantor which requires prewiring of
subdivisions or other developments for electrical and telephone service shall
be construed to include wiring for cable systems.
   (r)   Undergrounding of Multiple-Dwelling Units. In cases of single-site
multiple-dwelling units, the grantee shall minimize the number of individual
aerial drop cables by installing multiple drop cables underground between the
pole and the dwelling unit where such installation is determined to be
technologically and economically feasible, in agreement with the owners and/or
an owner's association of the multiple-dwelling units. This section shall apply
only to newly constructed buildings or unwired existing buildings. The grantee
shall be required to install drop cables underground only if all other
utilities are required to do the same at the time of installation.
   (s)   Rights-of-Way Occupancy. 
      (1)   In any case where the grantee has the required written permission
from the grantor not to underground its cable system facilities, the grantee
shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible
and economically feasible, and may not construct or install any new, different
or additional poles, conduits or other facilities on public property until the
written approval of the grantor is obtained.
      (2)   The grantee shall:
         A.   Locate and install all transmission lines, equipment and
structures so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners. However, the grantee shall retain the right to
determine, because of technical feasibility and technical reliability, where,
when, how and if equipment originally installed needs to be redesigned,
reconfigured or relocated;
         B.   Keep and maintain all transmission lines, equipment and
structures in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and
repair;
         C.   Employ professional care and install and maintain methods and
devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injuries or nuisances to the public;
         D.   Use suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices
as necessary for the safety of all members of the public;
         E.   Place any poles or other fixtures in any public right-of-way in
such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel of the right-of-way or
cause unsafe conditions of any sort; and
         F.   Comply with all local and State laws, rules and regulations
pertaining to traffic control.
      (3)   The grantee may not make paving cuts or curb cuts unless absolutely
necessary, and only after written permission and a street cut permit have been
obtained from the grantor, under such conditions as the grantor shall in its
reasonable discretion determine.
      (4)   The grantor may reasonably require conduit for underground cable in
areas specified by the grantor, said conduit to be provided at the grantee's
sole expense.
      (5)   Before beginning any excavation or other construction activity on a
public right-of-way or easement which crosses or abuts any private property,
the grantee shall clearly mark and delineate, with flags, stakes or non-
polluting water-soluble spray paint, the boundaries of that public right-of-way
or easement where it abuts or crosses the private property.
      (6)   In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley, easement,
public way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property, the
grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
grantor, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, easement, public
way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property to as good a
condition as it was, or a better condition than it was, before the work causing
such disturbance was performed.
      (7)   The grantee shall locate, mark and map any of its installed cable
or the cable system for the grantor at no expense to the grantor. The cable
shall be installed so that it can be detected by the use of standard locating
devices.
    (t)   Completion of Work by Grantor. Upon the failure of the grantee to
commence, pursue or complete any work required by law, by the provisions of the
franchise agreement or this chapter (other than completion of construction or
rebuilding of the cable system, which shall be governed by Section
814.30) or by any applicable permit, to be done in any public right-of-way or
public utilities easement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may, after notice to the grantee and
an opportunity to cure, cause the work to be done. The grantee shall pay to the
grantor the reasonable costs of the work in the itemized amount reported by the
grantor to the grantee, within thirty days after receipt of the itemized
report.
   (u)   Removal of Facilities. Upon receipt of written notice, the grantee, at
its own expense, shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove any of its property as necessary because of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, grade, separation or realignment or installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, transportation
facilities, tracks or any other type of structure or improvement.
   Nothing described in this subsection shall be considered a taking of the
property of the grantee, and the grantee is not entitled to additional
compensation because of these actions.
   The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the grantor, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit
the moving of the building or buildings. The grantee may require reasonable
advance payment for any such permittee prior to raising or lowering its wires.
   (v)   Stop Work. 
      (1)   On notice from the grantor that any work is being prosecuted
contrary to the provisions of the franchise agreement or this chapter, or in an
unsafe or dangerous manner as determined by the grantor, or in violation of the
terms of any applicable permit, laws, regulations, ordinances or standards, the
work may immediately be stopped by the grantor.
      (2)   The stop-work order shall be:
         A.   In writing;
         B.   Given to the individual doing the work, or posted on the work
site; and
         C.   Sent to the grantee by overnight delivery at the address given in
the franchise agreement.
         Further, such stop-work order may:
         D.   Indicate the nature of the alleged violation or unsafe condition;
and
         E.   Establish conditions under which work may be resumed.
   (w)   Grantee's Contractors. The grantee's contractors shall be licensed and
bonded in accordance with the grantor's ordinances and regulations and the
requirements of all contractors working in the public rights-of-way. Any action
or omission of a contractor of the grantee which violates any provision of the
franchise agreement shall be considered an action or omission of the grantee
for the purposes of this chapter.
   (x)   Private Property. Except in the case of an emergency involving public
safety or service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the grantee
shall give reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to
entering upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to
be performed, provided that in the case of construction operations, such notice
shall be delivered or provided, when possible, prior to entry. If any damage is
caused by any grantee activity or omission, the grantee shall reimburse the
property owner the reasonable cost of the damage or replace or repair the
damaged property. For installation of pedestals or other major construction or
installation projects, property owners shall also be notified by mail at least
one week in advance. In the case of an emergency (as defined above), the
grantee shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal tenant in person
and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event personal contact is not made.
Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private
property or any other property where such right to access or entry is not
otherwise provided by law.
   (y)   Burial Standards. 
      (1)   Depths. The grantee shall comply with the following burial depth
standards, unless local ordinances or the National Electrical Code standards
require a deeper minimum depth:
         A.   Cable drops from the pedestal shall be buried at a minimum depth
of eight inches.
         B.   Feeder lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         C.   Trunk lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         D.   Fiber optic cable shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen

      (2)   Timeliness. Temporary cable drops installed by the grantee to
residences shall be buried according to these standards within two calendar
weeks of initial installation. When freezing surface or other adverse weather
conditions prevent the grantee from achieving such timetable, the grantee shall
apprise the subscriber of the circumstances and the estimated time of burial in
writing, and shall provide the subscriber, in writing, with the grantee's
telephone number and instructions as to how and when to call the grantee to
request burial of the line if the revised schedule is not met.
   (z)   National Standards. The grantor shall have the option of adopting any
national standards for the installation of optic fiber hereafter promulgated or
established.
   (aa)   Construction Standards.  
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable grantor construction
codes, including, without limitation, the Ohio Basic Building Code, the
Residential Building Code of Ohio, the National Electrical Code, and the
Electronic Industries Association Standard for Physical Location and Protection
of Below-Ground Fiber Optic Cable Plant, zoning ordinances and permit
procedures. The grantor may charge reasonable permit fees consistent with
existing laws for upgrade construction of cable plant. To move the upgrade
construction process along, the grantor agrees to process all applications,
reviews, authorizations or consents pertaining to permits, zoning issues,
authorizations and consents in a period not to exceed thirty days from written
application or request to the grantor. If the grantor fails to do so within
said period, said request, application, authorization or consent shall be
deemed approved.
      (2)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all
applicable sections of Federal and State Occupational Safety and Health Acts,
and any amendments thereto, as well as all State and local codes and standards,
where applicable.
      (3)   All installation of electronic equipment shall be of a permanent
nature, durable and installed in accordance with the provisions of the National
Electrical Code, as amended, and all applicable State and local codes.
      (4)   Antenna supporting structures (towers) shall be designed for proper

A specifications, as they may be amended from time to time. Antenna supporting
structures (towers) shall be painted, lighted, erected and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration and all other applicable state and local codes or regulations.
      (5)   Neither the grantee's plant and equipment, nor any work that the
grantee performs, shall endanger or interfere in any manner beyond reasonable
requirements, given the work the grantee is performing, with the rights of any
property owner, or hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (6)   The grantee shall at all times employ professional care and shall
install and maintain in use methods and devices to prevent failures and
accidents which risk damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   (bb)   New Residential Developments. In new residential developments in
which all the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the
following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of
underground easements:
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to
the terms and provisions of this chapter and any franchise agreement, may be
required) to provide cable service to that development. The developer may
establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve
the development.
      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared
basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the Village any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be
entitled to recover the cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event
that the grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any
grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of the
date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed
to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall
have two working days to begin the installation of their cables and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         A.   It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         B.   It has received a written notification from each grantee that the
grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the
specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has received no reply
from a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which
case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating cable
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching or other burial
operation and associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition
which existed prior to such trenching or burial.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the Village
reserves the right to require clustering of pedestals with other utilities or
franchisees.
   (cc)   Street Improvements. The grantor shall give grantees no less that
forty-five days advance notice (or notice as soon as possible in cases of
emergency) of street improvements or other activity which could affect the
cable system, including, but not limited to, street or public rights-of-way
excavation; construction repair; grading; traffic conditions; installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power or signal lines or tracks; or vacation or
improvement of public works.
      (1)   All such public works shall be done, insofar as possible, in such a
manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of the
poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the cable system.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person from liability arising out of
the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid interfering with cable system
facilities while performing the public works.
      (2)   If any equipment of the grantee shall interfere with public works,
then, upon receipt of the forty-five day notice, that part of the equipment of
the grantee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the grantee in
such manner as shall be directed by the grantor so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the grantor, and
the grantee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.21   TECHNICAL STANDARDS; TESTS.
   (a)   The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards, Federal Communications Commission technical standards and any
standards set forth in its franchise agreement.
   (b)   Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical
standards shall constitute a material franchise violation.
   (c)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all applicable
sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, as well
as all other applicable local, State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (d)   All installation of electronic equipment shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code and the
National Electrical Code, as they may from time to time be amended.
   (e)   Antennae and their supporting structures (towers) shall be painted,
lighted, erected and maintained in accordance with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and all other applicable
local, State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (f)   All of the grantee's plant and equipment located within the franchise
area, including, but not limited to, the antenna site, the head-end and
distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wire,
coaxial cable, fixtures and appurtenances, shall be installed, located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained
and operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or
interfere with improvements that the Village may deem appropriate to make or to
interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
   (g)   The grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures
and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the
public.
   (h)   The grantee shall, at the grantee's expense, perform the following
tests on its cable system:
      (1)   All tests required by the FCC;
      (2)   All other tests as otherwise specified in this chapter or the
franchise agreement; and
      (3)   All other tests reasonably necessary to determine compliance with
technical standards adopted by the FCC at any time during the term of the
franchise.
   The grantee shall maintain written records of all results of its cable
system tests, performed by or for the grantee. Such test results shall be made
available to the grantor upon request within two weeks.
   (i)   The grantee shall submit to the grantor, upon written request, within
sixty days after the activation of the new system, a detailed test plan
describing the methods and schedules for testing the cable system on an ongoing
basis to determine compliance with the provisions of the FCC technical
standards. The tests may be witnessed by representatives of the grantor, and
written test reports shall be submitted to the grantor upon written request.
The grantee shall provide the grantor with thirty days notice of all required
FCC tests. In the event of any FCC test failures, FCC procedures shall apply.
   (j)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the grantor
may require, where reasonable, additional tests, full or partial repeat tests,
different test procedures or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal.
Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating any unresolved controversy or
noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular matter in
controversy. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such
special tests as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the grantee or the
subscriber. Failure to perform such properly requested additional tests within
thirty days shall constitute a material breach of the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.22   TRIMMING OF TREES.
   (a)   The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees, at its sole cost,
in accordance with all applicable utility, ordinance and easement restrictions,
upon and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the
Village, so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact
with the wires and cables of the grantee. Village representatives shall have
authority to supervise and approve all trimming of trees conducted by the
grantee.
   (b)   Except in emergencies, the grantee may not prune trees at a point
below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written notice has
been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the street in or
over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this section, emergencies exist
when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from imminent danger of
immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or occupant shall have one
week from the receipt of the grantee's notice to arrange for an outside
contractor to prune the tree at his or her own expense. If the owner or
occupant fails to do so, the grantee may prune such tree at its own expense.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.23   PROVISION OF CABLE TO PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   The grantee shall provide one free standard installation and free monthly
expanded basic service, exclusive of premium, pay-per-view and a la carte
services, to the locations to be listed in an exhibit attached to the franchise
agreement, as well as to all newly constructed public facilities, during the
term of the franchise, plus two additional public facility locations selected
by the grantor. Such sites may also receive premium and pay-per-view services
at a cost not greater than that charged to residential subscribers for the same
service.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.24   INDEMNIFICATION OF VILLAGE.
   (a)   The grantee, under any franchise operated pursuant to this chapter,
shall agree to indemnify, hold harmless, release and defend the Village, its
officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, from and against any and
all lawsuits, claims, causes of action, actions, liability, demands, damages,
disability, losses, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
or liabilities of any nature, that may be asserted by any person, resulting or
in any manner arising from the action or inaction of the grantee, its
subcontractors, employees and agents, in constructing, operating, maintaining,
repairing or removing the system, in carrying on the grantee's business or
operations in the Village, or in exercising or failing to exercise any right or
privilege granted by the franchise. This indemnity shall apply, without
limitation, to any action or cause of action for invasion of privacy,
defamation, antitrust, errors and omissions, theft, fire, violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent,
or any other right of any person, whether or not any act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or any franchise
agreement, but shall not include any claim or action arising out of the actions
or omissions of Village officers, employees or agents or related to any Village
programming or other access programming for which the grantee is not legally
responsible.
   (b)   The Village shall promptly notify the grantee of any claims subject to
indemnification by the grantee and shall cooperate with all reasonable requests
by the grantee for information, documents, testimony or other assistance
appropriate to a resolution of such claims. The grantee shall have full
responsibility for and control of any action or undertaking directed at the
resolution of such claims.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.25   INSURANCE; CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION BOND; PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   The grantee shall provide insurance as specified in the franchise
agreement.
   (b)   With respect to the initial construction of the cable system, or any
significant project to upgrade or rebuild more than fifty percent of the cable
system, grantee shall provide to the grantor a construction performance and
construction completion bond (herein referred to as the construction completion
bond), with a surety reasonably approved by the grantor's Solicitor, in an
amount equal to ten percent of the applicable estimated construction cost. Such
amount, however, shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). With
respect to the initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade or
rebuild project, when regular subscriber service is available to seventy-five
percent of occupied dwelling units, the amount of the bond shall be reduced by
fifty percent of the original amount. On the one-year anniversary of the
initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade or rebuild project, as
the case may be, the bond may be canceled.
   (c)   Within sixty days of the passage of the ordinance adopting the
franchise agreement, the grantee shall deposit with the grantor a surety bond
or letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Solicitor of the grantor (hereinafter referred to
as the performance bond). The performance bond shall be available to insure the
faithful performance by the grantee of provisions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement, other than with respect to construction, upgrading or
rebuilding projects covered herein, but including the obligation to remove the
above-ground portion of the cable system upon revocation or termination of the
franchise as set forth herein. The performance bond shall be maintained at
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) during the entire term of the franchise
agreement, regardless of withdrawals which may be made under this section. In
the event of a default by the grantee in any of its obligations under the
agreement, other than completion of construction, which default is not cured
within thirty days after notice by the grantor to the grantee of such default
(or such longer time as is necessary to cure, so long as the grantee commences
to cure within thirty days and diligently pursues cure), the grantor may levy
on the performance bond upon notifying the grantee of the amount of such
charge. The grantor may also levy upon the performance bond for sums due for
penalties under Sections
814.19(e) and
814.26(g). The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the performance
bond are in addition to all other rights of the grantor, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.26   RECORDS REQUIRED AND GRANTOR'S RIGHT TO INSPECT.
   (a)   The grantee shall at all times maintain and make available to the
grantor for inspection upon written request within two weeks:
      (1)   A full, current and complete set of plans, records and "as-built"
maps showing the location of the cable television system installed or in use in
the Village, exclusive of subscriber service drops and equipment provided in
subscribers' homes, to be updated periodically as warranted. (The grantee shall
furnish two complete sets of route maps to the grantor, which are applicable to
the franchise area, upon completion of the same, which shall be available for
public inspection during normal business hours at a location designated by the
grantee or at an office of the grantor.)
      (2)   A list of the grantee's services, rates and channel lineups;
      (3)   Subject to applicable law regarding subscriber privacy, all

program;
      (4)   A statistical compilation of service calls provided by the
appropriate grantee category, including a description of the problem, the

billing complaints. Nothing herein shall require the grantee to maintain
statistics regarding subscriber inquiries or questions concerning the company's
billing practices, programming, policies or procedures.
      (5)   An accurate and comprehensive file of any and all complaints
regarding the cable system, in a manner consistent with the privacy rights of
subscribers, and the grantee's actions in response to those complaints.
Complaints shall not include routine billing inquiries, disagreements with
company policies or practices or inquiries regarding individual programs or
program services carried or not carried by the grantee's cable system.
   (b)   The grantee shall also make available to the grantor, upon written
request, the following information:

which case a copy of the annual report shall be submitted; and
      (5)   An executive summary which shall include information concerning
customer complaints for the preceding twelve months. Such reports shall be
maintained by category. Complaints shall not include routine billing inquiries,
disagreements with company policies or practices or inquiries regarding
individual programs or program services carried or not carried by the grantee's
cable system.
   The grantee shall make available to the grantor such records upon written
request no more than one time per year. Records required by paragraph (b)(2)
hereof shall be made available to the grantor within thirty days. All other
information shall be made available to the grantor within seven days.
   (c)   Upon at least five business days written notice, and during normal
business hours, or, in case of emergency, upon demand, the grantee shall permit
examination by any duly authorized representative of the grantor, of any and
all franchise property and facilities, together with any appurtenant property
and facilities of the grantee situated within or without the Village, and any
and all records relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to
enable the grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under local,
State and Federal law, this chapter and the franchise agreement. Such records
include all books, records, maps, plans, financial statements, service
complaint logs, performance test results, records of requests for service and
other like materials of the grantee. The grantee shall have the right to be
present at any such examination.
    (d)   If any of the records described in this chapter or the franchise
agreement are proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by State,
Federal or local law, then upon written request by the grantee, such
information requested during an inspection shall be treated as confidential,
making it available for inspection purposes only to those persons who must have
access to perform their duties on behalf of the Village, including, but not
limited to, the Treasurer and the Solicitor. To the extent that any Federal
requirement for privacy applies to the information to be submitted, said law
shall control.
   (e)   Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports
submitted by the grantee, or on behalf of or relating to the grantee, to the
Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
any other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction
with respect to any matters affecting the cable system authorized pursuant to
this chapter and any franchise, shall be made available to the grantor upon
written request within two weeks. Copies of responses from the regulatory
agencies to the grantee shall likewise be furnished to the Village upon request
within two weeks. Upon written request by the grantor, the grantee shall make
available to the grantor copies of all pleadings, applications, notifications,
communications and documents of any kind, submitted by the grantee or its
parent corporation(s) to, as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence to
and from the grantee or its parent corporation(s) and actions by, any Federal,
State or local courts, other regulatory agencies and other government bodies
relating to the operations of the grantee's cable system within the franchise
area. The grantee shall submit such documents to the grantor no later than
thirty days after the written request.
   (f)   One copy of all reports and records mentioned in this chapter or in
the franchise agreement shall be made available upon written request to the
grantor within the time limits mentioned therein. All reports and records
required under this chapter or the franchise agreement shall be furnished at
the sole expense of the grantee, except as otherwise provided in this chapter
or in the franchise agreement.
   (g)   The failure of the grantee to report or make information available
upon written request as specified and within the time limits stated in this
chapter or the franchise agreement shall, following notice and an opportunity
to cure, subject the grantee to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day.
The grantee's liability to the grantor for such amount in such cases shall not
be in lieu of, but in addition to, the remedies set forth in Section
814.99 for franchise violations.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.27   ANNUAL REPORTS.
   The grantee shall submit a written end of the year report to the grantor
with respect to the preceding calendar year within 120 days of the end of that
year. Such report shall contain a summary of the previous year's activities in
the development of the cable system, including, but not limited to, services
begun or discontinued during the reporting year and improvements to the system.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.28   INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK; INTERCONNECTION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT NETWORKS.
   (a)   The grantee shall, at its cost, make available at an identified
location inside an exterior wall of the public facilities to be set forth in an
exhibit to the franchise agreement ("sites"), plus three additional facilities
designated by the grantor (which must be nonprofit institutions), two fibers,
in each case with not less than fifty feet of additional fiber extending inside
the facility ("institutional network"). Use of the fibers provided by the
grantee pursuant to this section will be limited to video and data
transmissions between and among the facilities described in this section and
any other facility attached to the institutional network under the terms of a
franchise between the grantee and the political subdivision in which such
facility is located. Any additional interior or exterior wiring or equipment
necessary to utilize the institutional network shall be at the cost of the
user. There shall be no cost to the grantor or the other designated sites for
the use and maintenance of the institutional network. In addition to the
Village, the grantee may provide telecommunications services to residential and
other non-residential subscribers on such terms and at such rates as the
grantee may in its discretion determine.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if technically feasible, the grantee
shall interconnect the institutional network with other dedicated fiber,
limited access institutional networks provided by other cable operators for the
sole purpose of providing educational access programming between school
districts and emergency agencies consisting of video or data transmissions,
provided that such interconnections shall be limited to dedicated fiber,
limited access, institutional networks servicing the municipalities and school
districts to be listed in an exhibit to the franchise agreement and may
consider other such interconnections requested by the grantor, and provided,
further, that the grantee shall not be required to provide such an
interconnection to a network located in a municipality in which it does not
have a franchise, unless the user assumes the cost of the initial connection.
All costs associated with the construction of the interconnections within the
franchise area shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee. There shall be
no cost to the grantor or the other designated sites for the use and
maintenance of the institutional network. All other costs shall be the sole
responsibility of the requesting party or the other cable operator.
   (c)   If the grantor or any of the sites has a presently existing network,
service on such network will not be unreasonably interrupted during the
building of the new system.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.29   PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL OR GOVERNMENT (PEG) ACCESS CHANNELS AND
FACILITIES.
   (a)   Following completion of the system upgrade/rebuild, the grantee shall
make available to each of its subscribers who receive some or all of the
services offered on the system, reception of at least three public, educational
and government (PEG) access channels to be allocated among public, educational
and government usage as determined by the grantor. The channels designated for
access shall be provided by the grantee as a part of the basic cable service.
The access channels shall be made available by the grantee for use by the
Village and its citizens in accordance with the rules and procedures
established by the Village or any lawfully designated person, group,
organization or agency authorized by the Village for that purpose.
   (b)   To the extent that any access channel is not being used for the
provision of non-commercial, public, educational or governmental access
purposes, the grantee shall be permitted to use such channel(s) for the
provision of other services, subject to any reasonable rules established by the
Village regarding such use. The grantee's permitted use of any access channel
made pursuant to this section shall cease within ninety days of the grantee's
receipt of notice from the Village that such channel will again be used for
public, educational or governmental access.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the above, the grantee may accommodate a request from
the Village for additional access capacity made pursuant to Section
814.28(b) by combining more than one access use on a channel, provided that:
      (1)   It is technically and economically feasible for the grantee to do
so;
      (2)   The scheduling needs of all users of the channel can be reasonably
accommodated; and
      (3)   The access entity which requires use of the alternate channel must
be able to access the alternate channel from the site where it normally
originates playback of its programs and may not be required to transport tapes
to a remote site for playback.
   (d)   However, the grantee shall provide an additional PEG channel for non-
commercial public, educational or governmental broadcasts in the event that the
three PEG channels provided under this section are then fully utilized. In no
event shall the grantee be required to provide in excess of one additional
access channel, and only after the cable system offers at least 150 channels.
As used in this section, "fully utilized" means utilized for original,
nonduplicative programming not less than eight hours per day, five days per
week, for a period of ten consecutive weeks. The additional PEG channel
provided under this section shall be reviewed annually by the grantee. Upon
such annual review, the additional PEG channel will continue to be made
available to the grantor to the extent that the PEG channels provided under
this agreement (including the additional PEG channel(s)) are at least seventy
percent fully utilized. To the extent that such capacity requirement is not
met, the additional PEG channel shall be terminated, subject to reactivation at
the request of the grantor upon demonstration by the grantor that the three
original and any other additional PEG channels provided under this section are
fully utilized, and to the annual review provided herein.
   (e)   The grantee shall provide free cable transmission facilities and free
modulation equipment to introduce programming onto these transmission
facilities by linking the below listed origination points with the head-end, or
through hubs to the head-end, for distribution to all subscribers generally and
for distribution to discrete audiences via scrambled signals and decoders at
the origination points for such channels.
   (f)   The grantee is responsible for all head-end equipment essential to
playback of programming for PEG access use in a location and under reasonable
rules determined by the grantee. The grantee shall also be responsible for the
operation and maintenance and all equipment necessary to perform those
functions. The grantee shall also either provide a studio and equipment
acceptable to the grantor for PEG access use or pay a fee in lieu of providing
the same, equal to up to one percent of adjusted gross revenues (gross revenues
above net of the franchise fee), as stated in the franchise agreement, to be
placed by the grantor in a special fund for such PEG access purposes.
   (g)   The grantor shall be responsible for the operation of access
facilities and equipment. In this regard, the grantor may delegate from time to
time its responsibilities to others who then shall assume the responsibility of
the grantor in accordance with the grantor's delegation. The grantor will
develop reasonable rules regarding use of access facilities and equipment and
determine the needs of the Village for public, educational and governmental
access services. In this regard, the grantor shall regularly coordinate with
grantee for the purpose of developing and maintaining reasonable access
facilities.
   (h)   Costs of providing said facilities shall not be a credit against
payment of the franchise fee imposed under the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.30   FRANCHISE VIOLATION.
   (a)   If the grantor believes that the grantee has failed to perform any
obligation under the franchise agreement or this chapter or has failed to
perform in a timely manner, the grantor may make written demand on the grantee
that it remedy the alleged failure. The grantor may order the grantee to
correct or remedy the failure or breach within the time and in the manner and
on the terms and conditions that the grantor may establish. If the alleged
failure is denied or not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the
grantor, the grantor may follow any procedures set forth in the agreement.
   (b)   Penalties may be assessed by the grantor for purposes including, but
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure of the grantee to pay the grantor sums due under the terms
of the franchise.
      (2)   Reimbursement of costs borne by the grantor to correct franchise
violations not corrected by the grantee, after thirty days written notice.
      (3)   Monetary remedies, penalties or damages assessed against the
grantee due to default or breach of franchise requirements.
   (c)   Upon written notice and agreement of the grantor and the grantee, an
informal meeting may be held at any time to review any alleged failure.
   (d)   If the grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material
obligation required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following
notice from the grantor and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, the
grantor may act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following
procedures:
   The grantor shall notify the grantee of any alleged material violation in
writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten days in
the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the
grantor under this chapter or the grantee's franchise and thirty days in all
other cases. If the grantee fails either to correct the violation within the
time prescribed, or to commence correction of the violation within the time
prescribed and thereafter diligently pursue correction of such violation, the
grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty days of a public
hearing to be held before the Council. Said notice shall specify the violations
alleged to have occurred. At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and
consider relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its decision. In
the event that the Council finds that a material violation exists and that the
grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner, or has not
diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the
grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the
Council may revoke the franchise or impose any other penalty permitted by the
franchise agreement and any other legal or equitable remedy available under the
franchise or applicable law.
   (e)   The grantor may assess against the grantee, after providing written
notice to the grantee and allowing thirty days or such other period of time as
is agreed upon by the grantee and the grantor to cure, monetary damages up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per calendar day or per incident for material
system upgrade or construction delays, and up to two hundred dollars ($200.00)
per calendar day or per incident for any other material breaches, provided that
all violations of a similar nature occurring at the same time shall be
considered as one incident. The grantor may have recourse to the performance
bond for payment of such damages, including the fifty dollar ($50.00) per day
penalty for failure to respond to the grantor's request for information due the
grantor within the time limits as specified in this chapter or the franchise
agreement pursuant to Section
814.26(g), and the one hundred dollars ($100.00) or five hundred dollars
($500.00) per day amounts for failure to timely pay the franchise fee pursuant
to Section
814.19(e), which shall not be subject to, but in addition to, the remedies set
forth in this section. The assessment of any monetary damages shall not
constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have
under the franchise or applicable law, including its right to recover from the
grantee any additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including
attorney's and/or consultant fees, that are incurred by the grantor by reason
of the breach of the franchise agreement.
   (f)   In addition to revocation in accordance with other provisions of the
franchise agreement, the grantor may revoke the franchise agreement and rescind
all rights and privileges associated with the franchise agreement in the
following circumstances, each of which represents a material breach of the
franchise agreement:
      (1)   If the grantee fails to perform any of its material obligations
under the franchise agreement or under any ordinances, documents or other terms
and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the grantee;
      (2)   If there is a pattern of noncompliance with the grantor's consumer
service standards;
      (3)   If the grantee willfully and deliberately fails for more than
twenty-four hours to provide continuous and uninterrupted cable service for the
entire franchise area, not subject to force majeure, as set forth in Section
814.31;
      (4)   If the grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the grantor or
any subscriber; or
      (5)   If the grantee becomes insolvent or if there is an order for relief
in favor of the grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.
   Written notice of intent to consider revocation under this subsection shall
be served on the grantee at least thirty days prior to the date of revocation.
The grantor shall hear any persons interested in the revocation and, within
ninety days after the hearing, shall determine that the franchise is to be
revoked and the performance bond forfeited or that the breach at issue is
capable of being cured by the grantee. In the latter case, the grantor shall
direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within the time, in the
manner and under the terms and conditions that the grantor determines are
reasonable under the circumstances.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.31   FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE'S INABILITY TO PERFORM.
   In the event that the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions
or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee's control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events
not within the control of the grantee shall include, without limitation, acts
of God, strikes, sabotage, riots, civil disturbances, restraints imposed by
order of a governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities,
explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes, landslides, and fires. In the event that any such delay in
performance or failure to perform affects only part of the grantee's capacity
to perform, the grantee shall perform to the maximum extent it is able to do so
and shall take all steps within its power to correct such cause(s). In
correcting such cause(s), the grantee shall take all reasonable steps to do so
in as expeditious a manner as possible. The grantee shall notify the grantor in
writing of the occurrence of an event covered by this section within five
business days of the date upon which the grantee learns of its occurrence.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.32   ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL OF FRANCHISE PROPERTY.
   (a)   In the event that the use of any property of the grantee within the
franchise area or a portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of
twelve months, the grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise
property.
   (b)   The grantor, upon such terms as the grantor may impose, may give the
grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or
equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the
franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities
and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and shall restore
any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and
equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and
places in as good a condition as they were prior to such removal without
materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility
wires, poles or attachments. The grantor shall have the right to inspect and
approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires,
attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance provisions of this chapter and any performance bond provided in the
franchise shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal
and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
section.
   (c)   Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the grantee, if
required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument,
satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership
of the franchise property abandoned.
   (d)   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or
upon its revocation or earlier expiration as provided for herein, in any such
case without renewal, extension or transfer, the grantor shall have the right
to require the grantee to remove, at its own expense, all above-ground portions
of the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the
Village within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180
days. The indemnification and insurance provisions and the performance bond
shall remain in full force and effect during the period of removal.
   (e)   If the grantee fails to complete any removal required by this section
or any other work required by law within the time limits set by the grantor
after the date of written notice and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the
grantor may cause the work to be done and:
      (1)   The grantee shall reimburse the grantor for the reasonable costs
incurred within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs; or
      (2)   The grantor may recover the costs through the performance bond
provided by the grantee.
   The grantor may also seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.
   (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter,
the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as
it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or public rights-
of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public
utility or other cable grantee.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.33   EXTENDED OPERATION AND CONTINUITY OF SERVICES.
   Upon either expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor shall
have discretion to permit and/or require the grantee to continue to operate the
cable television system for an extended period of time not to exceed six months
from the date of such expiration or revocation, unless extended by the grantor.
The grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions
of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service
and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.34   RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.
   (a)   A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the grantor,
cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or
trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership or
trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all the faults under the
franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such faults which is
satisfactory to the grantor; and
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.
   (b)   In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary or judicial sale of
the franchise property, or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve
notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale,
in which event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the
grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such
notice, unless:
      (1)   The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as
and in the manner that this chapter provides; and
      (2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.35   RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.
   (a)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
chapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required
to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   (b)   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by Federal or State regulation, if the grantor
determines that it is in the public interest to do so and that the enforcement
of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the
subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of
any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision
subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of
the franchise unless the statement so recites.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.36   RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (a)   The grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender or
sexual preference. The grantee shall comply at all times with all other
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations relating to
nondiscrimination.
   (b)   The grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local regulations.
   (c)   Neither the grantee nor any other person shall, without the
subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping of any cable line, signal
input device or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine
maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service and polling with
audience-participating or audience-viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (d)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's
right of privacy, as defined in the Cable Act, or other personal rights,
through the use of the system, as such rights are delineated or defined by
applicable law. The grantee shall not, without a lawful court order or other
applicable valid legal authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way
equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any
subscriber or general citizen.
   (e)   The grantee shall not sell or otherwise make available to unaffiliated
third parties (including the grantor) lists of the names and addresses of
subscribers, any list which identifies, by name, subscriber viewing habits, or
any personalized data pertaining to a subscriber's use of any of the
franchisee's services, without the express written consent of the subscriber to
which the personalized data pertains. For the purposes of this subsection,
"personalized data" shall mean the name and address of an individual subscriber
directly associated with data obtained on his or her use of specific services
provided by or through the grantee. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent, as a normal incident of commercial enterprise, the sale or
availability of nonpersonalized or aggregated data which are not personalized
data, as defined herein.
   (f)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter or other piece of equipment
owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the subscriber's
premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any
required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
the subscriber's property shall be presumed. Where a property owner or his or
her predecessor has granted an easement, including a public utility easement or
a servitude, to another, and the servitude by its terms contemplates a use such
as the grantee's intended use, the grantee shall not be required to obtain the
written permission of the owner for the installation of cable television
equipment.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.37   TIME LIMITS STRICTLY CONSTRUED.
   Whenever the franchise agreement sets forth a time for any material act to
be performed by the grantee, such time shall be deemed to be of the essence,
and any failure of the grantee to perform within the allowed time may be
considered sufficient grounds for the grantor to invoke any relevant penalty
provision of the franchise agreement or this chapter in accordance with the
provisions of Section
814.19(e), 814.26(g) or 814.30, as applicable.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.38   DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The grantor shall be vested, to the extent permitted by law, with the
power and right to regulate reasonably the exercise of the privileges permitted
by the franchise agreement in the public interest, or to delegate that power
and right, or any part thereof, to any agent, Village officer or employee or
established board, authority or commission, provided, however, that the
establishment of any such board, commission or authority, or the delegation of
such authority to any Village employee or agent, shall not relieve the grantor,
acting through its Village Council, of its ultimate authority and
responsibility as grantor hereunder, and provided, further, that all final
determinations required hereunder to be made by the grantor shall be made by
the Village Council as provided by law.
   (b)   The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply,
promptly and completely, with any provision of the franchise by any failure of
the grantor to promptly enforce compliance with the franchise.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.39   CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and a
franchise agreement entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this chapter
shall control, except as may be specifically otherwise provided in the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.40   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter, or any franchise agreement executed
subject to it, is held by any court, or by any Federal, State or county agency
of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or
State law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such
court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the
requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be
considered a separate, distinct and independent part of this chapter, and such
holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other
provisions hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect for the
term of any franchise agreement or renewal or renewals thereof. In the event of
such determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the grantor or the grantee shall have the option to
amend the parts of the franchise agreement related to the affected sections. In
the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed,
rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof which had
been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or
regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and
shall thereafter be binding on the grantor and the grantee, provided that the
grantor shall give the grantee sixty days written notice of such change before
requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may
be reasonably required for the grantee to comply with such provision.
(Ord. 1997-5. Passed 5-6-97.)
814.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for
each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.

Ch. 1288
860.01   PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses within the Village in order to promote the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens of the Village. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials or communication, including sexually
oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of this
chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment
protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of or exhibition of entertainment that
is obscene.
   (b)   Based on evidence submitted to Village Council and the Planning
Commission concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses including: the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton
v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991) and
including the studies conducted by other cities including, but not limited to,
those conducted by New York City, New York; Kansas City, Missouri; Denver,
Colorado; Newport News, Virginia and Phoenix, Arizona, this City Council finds
the following:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary and
unlawful and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in divisions a(1) through (a)(5) of this section
raise substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial government interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public
health, safety and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses
and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance
the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal, State and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate
the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal, State and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses and by the employees of such businesses will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal, State and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel and barring such individuals from the
management of an employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of
years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related
criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.

Village will issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented business
license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of the
applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business or adult motel named in the license
application under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business issued
pursuant to Section
860.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in division (g) of this
section; and
      (2)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
or adult motel under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business
employee license issued pursuant to Section
860.09 of this chapter for the period of time specified in division (g) of this
section; and
      (3)   Will be subject to the same requirements as a normal sexually
oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee license issued

860.09 of this chapter.
   (g)   A provisional license will expire on whichever of the following three
dates is earliest:

license or sexually oriented business employee license is issued to the
applicant pursuant to a judicial decision overturning the license denial; or
      (3)   The date one year from the issuance of the provisional license.
   (h)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending 30 days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Building Department pursuant to Section
860.12(b) of this chapter. The Building Department shall grant an application
for renewal of a provisional license unless he determines that new grounds
exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
860.07 or Section
860.09 of this chapter, which did not exist at the time of the original license
application. In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the
Village has the right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial
appeal of the previous license denial.

days from the date of issuance of such permit actual drilling of the well has
commenced. The cessation of production of oil or gas from the well after

remove all rights of the permit holder, subcontractor, independent contractor,

890.03   RATE OF TAX AND INCOME TAXABLE.
   (a)   An annual tax for the purpose specified in Section 890.01 shall be
imposed on and after July 1, 2013, at the rate of two and one-half percent per
year upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after July 1, 2013, by residents of the Village.
         A.   For further clarification income taxable by the Village of Walton
Hills shall include all income derived from prizes, awards, gambling, wagering,
lotteries, sports winnings or other similar games of chance by residents or
nonresidents of the Village within the Village in an amount in excess of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) or on the basis of activities conducted within the
Village on or after July 1, 2012. If the taxpayer is considered a professional
gambler for Federal income tax purposes, related deductions as permitted by the
Internal Revenue Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings,
otherwise no such deductions shall be permitted.
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after July 1, 2013, by nonresidents of the
Village for work done or services performed or rendered within the Village.
Separation pay, termination pay, reduction-in- force pay, and other
compensation paid as a result of an employee leaving the service of an employer
shall be allocable only to the Village;
         A.   The Village shall not, however, tax the compensation of a
nonresident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant for
purposes of the following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the Village on 12 or fewer days during the calendar year, in
which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the Village’s income tax. A day is a full day or any fractional
part of a day;
            2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual’s employer is located outside the Village
and the individual pays tax on compensation described in Section 890.03(b) to
the Municipality, if any, in which the employer’s principal place of business
is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the individual; and
            3.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by
the Village.
         B.   Beginning with the thirteenth day an individual deemed to have
been an occasional entrant to the Village performs services within the Village,
the employer of said individual shall begin withholding the Village income tax
from remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the Village in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned within the Village by the individual for the first 12 days.
         C.   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
Village.
      (3)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on and after July 1, 2013, of all resident unincorporated business
entities or professions or other activities, derived from sales made, work
done, services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted
in the Village;
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received on and after July 1, 2013, of a resident partner or
owner of a resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the
Village and not levied against such unincorporated business entity by the
Village;
      (4)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on or after July 1, 2013, of all nonresident unincorporated business
entities, professions or other activities derived from sales made, work done,
services performed or rendered and business and other activities conducted in
the Village, whether or not such unincorporated business entity has an office
or place of business in the Village;
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received on or after July 1, 2013, of a resident partner or owner
of a nonresident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the Village
and not levied against such unincorporated business entity by the Village;
         C.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on and after July 1, 2013, of all corporations derived from sales made,
work done, services performed or rendered and business or other activities
conducted in the Village, whether or not such corporations have an office or
place of business in the Village;
      (5)   In accordance with a ballot issue approved by residents on November
4, 2003, the full amount of the distributive share of S Corporation
shareholders is taxable; and
      (6)   On the portion attributable to the Village pursuant to the terms of
this chapter and including income earned by a taxpayer from a royalty interest
in the production of an oil or gas well, whether managed, extracted or operated
by the taxpayer individually or through an agent or other representative. Such
income shall be included in the computation of net profits from a business
activity to the extent that such royalty interest constitutes a business
activity of the taxpayer. Where the gross income received by a taxpayer from a
royalty interest in the production of an oil or gas well in a taxable year
exceeds three thousand dollars ($3,000), it shall be prima- facie evidence that
the income was derived from a business activity of such taxpayer, and the net
income from such royalty interest shall be subject to tax. If the income is
three thousand dollars ($3,000) or less, the income shall be taxed as ordinary
income.
   (b)   Net profits from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for the purpose of income taxation in the same proportion
as the average ratio of the factors in divisions (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this
section:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period, to the average original cost of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this
paragraph, real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation paid during
the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Village, to qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation paid during the same period to persons employed in the business or
profession, wherever their services are performed.
       (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (4)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with
divisions (b)(1), (2) and (3) hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as
are applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total, in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in division (a) hereof. A factor is
applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or outside the Village.
      (5)   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula in divisions
(b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section does not produce an equitable result,
another basis (including the use of the books and records method) may, under
uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.
      (6)   As used in division (b)(3), “sales made in the Village” means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village;
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside of the Village, regardless of
where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees,
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.
   (c)   (1)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under divisions (a)(3) and
(4) only if, and to the extent that, the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax, provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, provided, further, that in the case of farm property, the owner
shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he or she shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts
derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, and provided, further, that the person who
operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
      (3)   Rental income of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or less per
month shall be taxable as ordinary income.
   (d)   Operating Loss Carry-Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to July 1, 1968, allocable to the Village, may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village
until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss may be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the Village.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (e)   Exemptions (Sources of Income Not Taxed). The tax provided for in this
chapter shall not be levied on the following:
      (1)   Military pay or allowance of active members of the Armed Forces of
the United States and of members of their reserve components, including the

      (10)   Compensation paid to a precinct election official, to the extent
that such compensation does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually.
      (11)   For taxpayers filing itemized Federal returns, tax shall not be

copies of all W-2 forms, 1099 miscellaneous income forms, page one of Form 1040
(and page two if expenses are claimed of Federal Form 2106), page one and two
of Form 1120, 1120s (including (K-1), 2106, 1065, Schedule C (including cost of
goods manufactured and/or sold), Schedule E, Schedule F and any other Federal
schedules, if applicable.
   (d)   Extensions.
      (1)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual
return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period not to exceed six months,
or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal
Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return. However, for
taxable years 2004 and later, the extended due date for individuals shall be
the last day of the month following the month to which Federal income tax due
date has been extended. For businesses, if the extension is filed through the
Ohio business gateway, the extended due date shall be the last day of the month
to which the due date of the Federal income tax return has been extended. If
not filed through the Ohio business gateway the extended due date shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the Federal
Income Tax Return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails
to file the request timely, fails to file a copy of the Federal extension
request, or if the taxpayer’s income tax account with the municipality is
delinquent in any way.
      (3)   The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is
normally due. No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which
the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (e)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided,
however, that:
      (1)   Where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
890.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
890.07, or where an income tax has been paid on the same income to another
municipality, credit for the amount so deducted or paid, or credit to the
extent provided for in Section
890.13, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election,
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof), shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (f)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for Federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the municipality.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the Village. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the Village
by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related
by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other
method, he or she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, a taxpayer must file an amended return in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
890.09 and
890.13. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e., cash
or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (i)   Losses from the operation of a business or profession cannot be used
to reduce wages from employment or other employment compensation.
   (j)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
(Ord. 2007-23. Passed 6-19-07.)
890.06   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village shall
deduct, at the time of the payment of such income, qualifying wages, commission
or other compensation, the tax rate as established in Section
890.03 per year of the income, qualifying wages, commissions or other
compensation due by such employer to such employee and shall, on or before the
twentieth day of each month, make a return and pay to the Administrator the
amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month. However, if the amount
of the tax so deducted by any employer averaged less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month in the previous 12-month tax year, the employer may defer
the filing of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the twentieth
day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter for which taxes have
been withheld. Such approval for quarterly filings and payments may be
withdrawn by the Administrator when it is in the best interest of the Village
to do so.
   (b)   The returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to
the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have, in
fact, been withheld.
   (c)   Such employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the Village as a trustee for the
benefit of the Village, and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person's residence, even though such residence is in the Village, but such
employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   On or before February 28 of each year, beginning with the year 1986,
each employer shall file a withholding return setting forth the names,
addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose compensation
the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax
withheld from his or her employees and such other information as may be
required by the Administrator. All payments not subject to withholding shall be
reported on a form required by the Administrator.
   (f)   On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or other who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the Village with copies of all 1099
miscellaneous income forms and/or a list of names, addresses, social security
numbers or Federal identification numbers and a total amount of earnings,
payments, bonuses, commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
   (g)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall, prior to
commencement of the service, provide the Village the names, addresses, and
Federal identification numbers of the subcontractors. The subcontractors shall
be responsible for all income tax employer requirements under this chapter.
   (h)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged with
the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing the return and/or making the
payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file the return or pay
the tax due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization
of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability
for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
(Ord. 2007-23. Passed 6-19-07; Ord. 2009-32. Passed 1-5-10.)
890.07   DECLARATIONS OF INCOME NOT COLLECTED AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Except as provided in this section, every person shall file a
declaration setting forth taxable income, including distributive shares of net
profits of unincorporated business entities, estimated to be earned by the
taxpayer during the current tax year, together with the estimated tax due
thereon, less the tax withheld within the Village and less the tax credit
allowed in Section
890.13, unless the entire taxable income is subject to withholding within the
Village. If the estimated tax for the current year, less the tax to be withheld
and less such tax credit, is less than four hundred dollars ($400.00), no
declaration or payment of estimated tax is required.
   (b)   (1)   The declaration required by this section shall be filed on or
before April 15 of each year during the effective period set forth in Section
890.04 or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or
period.
   (c)   (1)   The declaration required by this section shall be filed upon a
form furnished by or obtainable from the Administrator, or on an acceptable
generic form as defined in this chapter. As provided in this section, credit
shall be taken for the tax to be withheld by the Village from any portion of
such income, and credit shall be taken for tax to be paid or withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality, in accordance with the provisions of
Section
890.13.
      (2)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment thereof may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (d)   Payment Dates.
      (1)   The declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the Village shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated non-withheld
and/or under-withheld tax due.
      (2)   If the taxpayer is an individual, at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth, and thirteenth months
after the beginning of the taxpayer’s taxable year, provided that in case an
amended declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of
the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   If the taxpayer is a corporation or association, at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth, and
twelfth months of the taxable year; provided, however, that in case an amended
declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of the
year only, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (e)   No penalties or interest shall be assessed, for not filing a
declaration, if the taxpayer qualifies under one of the following provisions:
      (1)   A resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the Village on the
first day of January in the year in which they became subject to estimated
payments.
      (2)   The taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 100% of the previous
year’s tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a 12 month
period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 90% of the final tax
liability for the tax year due on or before April 15 of the current year.
   (f)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Village shall
be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
890.05. However, any taxpayer may file, on or before the last day of the first
month of the year following that for which such declaration or amended
declaration was filed, an annual return and pay any balance due at such time in
lieu of paying the final quarterly installment based upon a declaration or
amended declaration of estimated tax.
(Ord. 2007-23. Passed 6-19-07; Ord. 2014-13. Passed 11-18-14)
890.08   INTEREST AND PENALTY ON UNPAID TAX.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld
by employers and all installments of estimated taxes required to be paid under
the provisions of this chapter, and remaining unpaid after they become due,
shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per year.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in this section, penalties based
on the unpaid tax or installments of estimated tax are hereby imposed as
follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes or estimated taxes due, other than taxes
withheld: the Tax Administrator may impose a penalty of 12% per year, but not
less than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: 10% per month
or fraction of a month thereof, but the accumulated penalty shall not exceed
50% upon any unpaid amount and shall be not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00); and
      (3)   In the case of a taxpayer who fails to file his or her return when
due, and who is not otherwise exempt from the filing requirement, the Tax
Administrator may impose a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator. In the absence of
fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax
assessment resulting from a Federal audit, provided an amended return is filed
and the additional tax is paid within three months after a final determination
of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Administrator, the Board of Review may
abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the refusal of the
Administrator to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both, for good cause shown.
(Ord. 2007-23. Passed 6-19-07; Ord. 2014-16. Passed 12-16-14.)
890.09   COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. An additional assessment shall not be made after three years from
the time the return was due or filed, whichever is later. However, in the case
of fraud, omission of 25% or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to
file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to
recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within six years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later.
   (b)   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of limitations, the
period within which an additional assessment may be made by the Administrator
shall be one year from the time of the final determination of the Federal tax
liability.
   (c)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded, unless a claim for
refund is made within three years from the date upon which such payment was
made or the return was due, or within three months after the final
determination of the Federal tax liability, whichever is later. In addition,
the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified
deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (d)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that should
have been deposited with the Village, but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the Village. The Village will
allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other Municipality is the same or higher than the Village’s tax rate. If
the Village’s tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of
the rates is also subject to collection by the Village.
   (e)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that
should have been deposited with the Village, but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the Village. The Village will
allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village’s tax rate. If
the Village’s tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of
the rates is also subject to collection by the Village.
   (f)   Payments on delinquent amounts shall be applied in the following
manner:
      (1)   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments in the order in which
such assessments became due.
      (2)   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order such taxes
became due.
      (3)   To the taxpayer's current estimated tax liability.
   (g)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.

taxes owing to the Village under this chapter, to keep accurate records for a
minimum of six years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file

including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns. In
addition to this chapter, taxpayers are hereby required to comply with the
requirements of the rules and regulations.
   (d)   If any taxpayer fails to file a tax return which is required by this
chapter within the time prescribed therefor, but consents to disclose all
information necessary to the preparation thereof, then the Administrator may
prepare such return which, after being signed by such person, may be received
by the Administrator as the return of such person.
   (e)   If any taxpayer fails to file a tax return which is required by this
chapter within the time prescribed therefor, or makes, willfully or otherwise,
a false or fraudulent return, then the Administrator shall make in a reasonable
manner such return from his own knowledge and from such information as he can
obtain through testimony or otherwise.
   (f)   Assessments.
      (1)   The Administrator may calculate and assess any taxpayer for the
amount of tax, penalty and interest which is imposed by this chapterand which

the liability assessed, the taxation period and the amount of the assessment.
If the taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within 30 days, the tax,
penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and payable and collectible
as are other unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest.
      (2)   Any return executed by or any assessment made by the Administrator
pursuant to this chapter shall be prima-facie good and sufficient for all legal
purposes. The Administrator may execute supplemental tax returns and may issue
supplemental assessments whenever the Administrator has knowledge derived from
any source, including the taxpayer's financial data, that any executed tax
return or assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.
      (3)   Neither the Administrator's execution of a return nor the
Administrator's assessment of a taxpayer shall start the running of the period
of limitations on prosecutions set forth elsewhere in this chapter.
   (g)   Neither the Administrator's execution of a return nor the
Administrator's assessment of a taxpayer shall start the running of the period
of limitations on prosecutions set forth elsewhere in this chapter. Failure to
make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount,
including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand, and the provisions
of Sections
890.09 and
890.12 shall apply.

provisions and limitations of Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
Chapters 890 and

provisions will prevail.
   (b)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person or

Village, and every person or entity earning or receiving income or net profits
within the Village of Walton Hills - Sagamore Township Joint Economic

the United States relating to Federal income taxation or in Ohio R.C. Title
LVII, unless the context clearly requires or indicates a different meaning. If
a term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is
used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to
Federal income tax and in Ohio R.C. Title LVII, and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to Federal
income tax shall control over the use of the term in Ohio R.C. Title LVII.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural,
and the masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (c)   As used in this chapter:

a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under division (c)(23)D. of this section, means a C corporation's
Federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         A.   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in Federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         B.   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         C.   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
Federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Sections 1221 or 1231 of the
Internal Revenue Code;
         D.   1.   Except as provided in Division (c)(1)D.2. of this section,

an asset described in Sections 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            2.   Division (c)(1)D.1. of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Sections 1245 or 1250

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.
            2.   No person may use the deduction allowed by division (c)(1)H.
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
            3.   a.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or

to division (c)(1)H. of this section.
            5.   Nothing in division (c)(1)H.3.a. of this section precludes a

beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division

shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member are not allowed as a
deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of
capital and treated as payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States Treasury Regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village for all or
part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the Village on the
last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax Administrator
reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the Village for all or
part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (a)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Village for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be considered

the Village if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of the Village and while away overnight from that abode spends
at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
Village. For purposes of this section, the State's contact period test or
bright-line test and resulting determination have no bearing on municipal

891.06   COLLECTION AT SOURCE
891.061   COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Village is required to withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the Village multiplied by the applicable rate of the Village's income tax,
except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
891.062 or divisions (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer is required to deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required to remit
to the Village Tax Administrator the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the Tax
Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following schedule:
      (1)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required to
make payments under division (b)(2) of this section of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld is required to make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
      (2)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld are required to be
remitted monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded
two thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded
two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(2) of this section
shall be made so that the payment is sent to the Tax Administrator not later
than fifteen days after the last day of each month.
      (3)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, an employer,
agent of an employer or other payer may make payment by electronic funds
transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf
of the employee for remittance to the Village if the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer is required to make payments electronically for the
purpose of paying Federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section
6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal
statute or regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under
this division does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's
obligation to file any return as required under this section.
      (4)   An agent of an employer that is providing employee tax withholding
services to employers, that provides such services to five or more employers
with employees within the Village is required to make payment by electronic
funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on
behalf of the employee for remittance to the Village, if such agent is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division will be accepted by the Village as the return required of an employee
whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages
reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village's income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the Village
during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if any, from
each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying wages paid
to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of every other
municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been withheld
from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other information
required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service
Form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee, and other
information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, is personally liable for a failure to
file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution
of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not discharge the
officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1) of this section among those two or
more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "the

the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
Section

public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Village.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the Village only
if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the
employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation on that day.
For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the

         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (b)(1) of this section shall

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold described in

the Village for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer
pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Village.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village under
division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the Village for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the Village.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the Village are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in the Village, an employer shall withhold
municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a taxable
year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in which the
employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a small
employer as defined in Section
891.04. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding
the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
891.061.

required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

891.071   DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer, who is not an individual, for the
Village is calculated as follows:
   (a)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 net
operating loss carry- forward" equals "municipal taxable income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer.
         A.   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
891.04(c)(23).
         B.   "Adjusted Federal taxable income" is defined in Section
891.04(c)(1).
      (2)   "Exempt income" is defined in Section
891.04(c)(11).
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
891.072.
      (4)   "Pre-2017 net operating loss carry-forward" is defined in Section
891.04(c)(32).
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.072   NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village or
the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone company
that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio R.C. Chapter 5745.
For purposes of this section, the Village is defined in Section
891.04(c)(49), and the net profit calculated herein shall apply as set forth in
Sections
891.071 and
891.072.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
891.062;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Village;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method must
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed are sitused to the Village as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property are
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from a
stock of goods located within the Village.
         B.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services are sitused to the Village
to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village are sitused to the Village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village are sitused to the Village.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property are sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the tangible
personal property is used in the Village.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual is subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which
the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal corporation
in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit resides. The
Village will allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the
purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal
corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate are sitused to the municipal corporation in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker will be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. Such an individual may claim a credit for
taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation
to the extent that such credit is allowed under Section
891.091.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to the Village any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would
be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
Village under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator will approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under divisions (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year is also required to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer is required to prepare a consolidated municipal income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return must compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
891.04(c)(1), by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for
"Federal taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.04(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return must do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.072, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity is subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.072, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity is not
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations, is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return must exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.072, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity is subject to municipal income taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return must
make the computations required under Section
891.072 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
891.074   TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Village, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or non-refundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the Village.
If a credit is granted under this Section, it will be measured as a percentage
of the new income tax revenue the Village derives from new employees of the
taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years. Before the
Village passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Village and the taxpayer
must enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.075   TAX CREDITS TO FOSTER JOB RETENTION.
   The Village, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the Village. If a credit is granted under this section, it will be
measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the Village derives from the
retained employees of the taxpayer, and may not be for a term exceeding 15
years. Before the Village passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the
Village and the taxpayer must enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.

to be the taxpayer's income tax liability to the Village for the current
taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer must make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages will be considered as paid
to the Village when such taxes were withheld in equal amounts on each payment
date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, the amounts withheld will be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
         C.   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months must make
a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns must file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes must be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
891.101(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the first
taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis must file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that is payable through estimated taxes made payable to the Village or Tax
Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, is as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the first month of the
following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator, as provided in Section
891.20. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown
due on the amended declaration must be paid in equal installments on or before
the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration must be filed on the next
applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)A. through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return is required to be filed and any balance which may be due must be
paid with the return in accordance with Section
891.101.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, a penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
891.11 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section will be deemed to be due to reasonable cause and
the penalty imposed by this section will not be added to the taxes for the
taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the Village under
Section
891.101 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

891.09   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
891.091   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the Village is subject to a municipal income tax
in another municipality, that resident may not be required to pay a total
municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the
higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, commissions, or other personal service
compensation for work done outside the Village, if it is made to appear that
the taxpayer has paid a municipal income tax on the same income taxable under
this chapter to another municipality, will be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by the taxpayer or on the
taxpayer's behalf to such other municipality. The credit may not exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or
municipalities where that tax is paid.
   (c)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made as
provided elsewhere in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.092   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average will
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit is allowed against the income tax imposed by the Village for each
qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of
the credit will be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the
qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer may claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation, including the Village to which the taxpayer paid
municipal income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan in one or more taxable years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation will be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case may the amount of the credit allowed under this section
exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal
corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal income tax that has been
withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan will be
considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan will not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.093   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Village will grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of
the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created under Ohio
R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Ohio R.C.
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation,
pursuant to Section
891.091. This credit is not applicable to residents of the Village working in
the Village of Walton Hills - Sagamore Hills Township Joint Economic
Development District or any other joint economic development district in which
the Village is a partner or participant, as such joint economic development
districts are considered part of the Village for purposes of this chapter, thus
not subjecting residents of the Village to multiple municipal income taxes on
said income.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.094   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Village, but should
have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by
the Village as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds
as provided in Section
891.106.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the Village, but
was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is subject to
collection and recovery by the Village. To the extent a refund of such tax or
withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.106, the Village will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the Village
claims is due. If the Village's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the
net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the Village,
along with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.106.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires the Village to allow credit for tax
paid to another municipal corporation if the Village has reduced credit for tax
paid to another municipal corporation. Section
891.091 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.10   ANNUAL RETURN
891.101   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   A.   An annual Village municipal income tax return must be
completed and filed by every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the
taxpayer is subject to the tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         B.   Any person who has no income taxable by the Village need not file
an annual return and shall be considered exempt. Any person who has exempt
income must certify on a form to be prescribed by the Tax Administrator that
such person's income is exempt and declare the nature of the exemption. The
person that is exempt, and thereafter begins receiving income subject to
taxation by the Village, must inform the Tax Administrator, in writing, within
30 days of beginning to receive such income.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator will accept on behalf of all nonresident and
resident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer located in the Village under Section
891.061(c) when the nonresident or resident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the Village.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, who turn 18 years of age during
the tax year or are older than 18, are required to file an annual municipal
income tax return with the Village, regardless of income or liability.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual must be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village in accordance with this chapter, the return or notice
required of that individual must be completed and filed by the individual's
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such duly
authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged
with the care of the person or property of that individual must provide, with
the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support that such
representative is authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the duly
authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice must include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information, including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   Spouses may file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section must contain
the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of
the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and must include the
taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return must be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
Form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form 1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-
REIT, Form 1120F, or Form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by the Village.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator will
request, and the taxpayer must provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return must also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Village.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual must be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer must complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter,
the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.102 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
891.102, the provision in Section
891.102 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due
is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section is required to file with the
Village an annual net profit return under divisions (f)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (i)   (1)   The date of the postmark on the cover of any report, claim,
statement, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to
be made, to or with the Tax Administrator or the Village, will be deemed the
date of delivery or payment. “The date of postmark” means, in the event there
is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by
the Postal Service.
      (2)   If a payment is made by electronic funds transfer, the payment is
considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account designated by
the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except that, when a
payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to circumstances not
under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered to be made when
the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this section, “submitted
the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery
of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date the payment was
initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
891.061 will be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this section will include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return will state that by checking
the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the preparer
or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other
review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to
provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return,
to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other
review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to
respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation
that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the
preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return
does not preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding
such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator will accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village in accordance
with this chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules
adopted by the Village under this chapter, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter governing the filing of returns, reports, or
documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator will accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
891.062.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the Village for a taxable year if both
of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location within the Village, and the person has filed all
appropriate and required returns and remitted all applicable income tax and
withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The Tax Administrator is not
required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not complied with the
provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the Village, and does
not expect to be subject to the Village's income tax for the taxable year. The
person must provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the
person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the Village. The affidavit also must include the following
statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the
Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become subject to the tax
levied by the Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the Village, if such a registration is required by the Village's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules." The person must sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Village in the taxable
year. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income
on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed
with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (n) of
this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the
person.
   (o)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.

   (a)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator for both an
extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment
of taxes required by the Village in accordance with this chapter during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator will enter
into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in installments
that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this
section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant may not be required to file
any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Village before the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator may not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code will receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator may not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator may
not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this
section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which divisions (a), (b), or (c) of this
section may apply to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.103   USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation on the taxpayer's
net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal income tax
return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for filing a
municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be due on
such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   This section does not affect the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by the Village, taxpayers, or
other persons does not affect the legal rights of the Village or taxpayers as
otherwise permitted by law.
   (e)   This section does not limit or remove the Village's authority to
administer, audit, and enforce the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.104   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return will automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return will be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
will be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator must grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer will
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.105   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer is required to file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Village in accordance with this
chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer, who is otherwise permitted to do so under this
chapter or under Ohio R.C. Chapter 718, intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return must be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
891.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid may not exceed the amount of tax that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a)(1) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Village to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
891.106. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
may not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded may not exceed the amount of refund that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.106   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Village:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund must be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator will
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
Village official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this
section, the Tax Administrator will issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment will state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator will notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.24.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section will be considered to have been filed
in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the

   (d)   Interest will be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest will
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year will be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest will be paid at the interest rate described in Section
891.11(a)(4).

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

Village's ordinances that were effective before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   The Village will impose on a taxpayer, employer, agent of the

Tax Administrator will inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have
commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator is required to conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular
business hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A
taxpayer who is unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit must offer
reasonable alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator will prescribe a form by which
a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in
the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax Administrator.
If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax Administrator may accept
other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate, that a person
is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section does not excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by the

(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)

fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) will be
dropped, rounding down to the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to
round amounts entered on a document, the person must round all amounts entered
on the document.

the Tax Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax

withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (h)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in a manner

(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.142   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator requires.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment plan
proposed by a person with respect to a claim is not appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment plan with respect to a claim shall be binding
upon and shall operate for the benefit of only the parties to the compromise or
agreement, and does not extinguish or otherwise affect the liability of any
other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment plan with respect to a claim shall be
void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if the
compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment plan.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment plan.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.143   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.144   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, the Tax Administrator may
seek to impose a penalty upon the person to whom the request was directed
pursuant to Section
891.11, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
891.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, the Tax Administrator may seek to impose a penalty pursuant to
Section
891.11.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
891.99 for a violation of Section
891.16, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.15   CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinances of the Village is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Village as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or under this chapter. The Village Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the
State Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.16   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by this chapter or State law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or shall knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator will be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Village in accordance
with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator will remain in effect and will
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or this chapter that
would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the
Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or this chapter;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Village in order to obtain a
more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.16.
   (e)   If the Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion will include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds the Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared. An opinion of a
tax administrator of another municipal corporation does not bind the Village
Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The Tax Administrator will make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
will the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.18   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056. Where the Tax Administrator attempts service by certified
mail and that service is unsuccessful, the Administrator may serve an
assessment by ordinary mail in compliance with Ohio R.C. 718.18, the effective
date of which service shall be governed by that section of the Ohio Revised
Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within 60 days
after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-6. Passed 11-17-15.)
891.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes must be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension also extends for the same period of time the time limit described
in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.24. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review with
which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax must be commenced within three years after the
commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file
a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be reported,
prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the
offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
891.106.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   A refund shall be issued to the appellant or the appellant's
representative upon final determination of any such appeal where and to the
extent the appellant is successful, in the amount of the overpayment, with
interest.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;

thereof, the drainage ditch in the street right-of-way will be subject to
severe erosion, a storm sewer and catch basins of proper size and design shall
be installed.
   (b)   Wherever it is necessary to drain water from one side of the street to
the other under the pavement, reinforced concrete or other approved culvert
pipe of adequate capacity and size shall be installed with a minimum diameter
of 12 inches, a minimum slope to the point of outlet of one inch in each ten
feet of length and at a depth of a minimum of six inches from the subgrade or

12 inches, a minimum base below the culvert pipe of three feet and of
sufficient width to secure permanently the discharge water. Adequate provision
shall be made for prevention of erosion at the outlet end of such culvert. A
thick stand of a mixture of 50 percent Kentucky blue grass, 40 percent fescue
and ten percent white clover shall be established on the berms, shoulders and
overall right-of-way of the street.

   No person, other than the Engineer, the Street Commissioner, the Inspector
of Buildings or the authorized employees or agents of the Village, shall make
any opening in any street, alley, sidewalk or other public way in the Village
unless and until he or she has obtained a permit to make such opening prior to
the commencement of the work, as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1966-14. Passed 6-7-66.)
1024.02   ISSUANCE; FEE; CONTENTS OF APPLICATION.
   Each permit for making any such opening shall be limited to a single project
and shall be issued only to, or in the name of, the property owner requesting
such permit. Such permit shall be issued by the Mayor and the Clerk and the fee
therefor shall be as set forth in
Chapter 208 of the Administration Code (the General Fee Schedule). Application
for such permit shall be made on a form approved by the Mayor and shall show
the exact location of the proposed opening, the kind of paving, the area, depth
and estimated duration of such opening and such other pertinent information as
may be requested.
1024.03   SECURITY DEPOSIT AND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Before the permit is issued, a cash deposit of two thousand dollars
($2,000), plus one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each additional opening, not
to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or a surety bond in a similar amount,
shall be posted with the Clerk to cover the cost of restoration, conditioned
upon prompt and satisfactory refilling of excavations and restoration of all
surfaces disturbed. However, in the case of an open cut across or through a
paved surface, the cash deposit or surety bond shall be two thousand dollars
($2,000). Permission to make an open cut through pavement shall be granted only
in cases where no other means of completing the project is feasible. Before any
work is begun, the permittee shall also furnish a certificate of public
liability insurance evidencing personal injury (including death) coverage of
two hundred thousand dollars/six hundred thousand dollars ($200,000/$600,000)
minimum limits, and one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) coverage for

1024.04   SUPERVISION; INSPECTION.
   The opening and restoration of a pavement or other surface shall be
performed under the direction and to the satisfaction of the Engineer, the
Street Commissioner or the Inspector of Buildings, as directed by the Mayor,
and in accordance with such rules, regulations and specifications as may be
approved by Council. The Engineer, Street Commissioner or Inspector of
Buildings, as the case may be, shall inspect the opening and restoration and
shall be paid at the current rate on file at the Village Hall for such
inspection, such charge to be borne by the permittee.
(Ord. 1994-28. Passed 12-20-94.)
1024.05   VILLAGE'S REMEDY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE; COSTS.
   Upon failure of the permittee to satisfactorily fill the excavation, restore
the surface and remove all excess materials within the time specified in the
permit, or, where not so specified, within a reasonable time after commencement
of the work, the Village may proceed, without notice, to make such fill and
restoration, and the cash deposit or surety bond required by Section
1024.03 shall be deemed forfeited. Such deposit, or the proceeds of such surety
bond, shall be paid into the Street Repair Fund of the Village, except such
part thereof, if any, which represents the difference between the amount of
such deposit (or the proceeds of such bond) and the charges of the Village for
such fill and restoration services. If the cost of such services should exceed
the amount of such deposit or bond proceeds, the permittee shall deposit the
difference with the Clerk forthwith. Any unexpended portion of such deposit or
bond proceeds shall be refunded to the permittee within seven days after
completion of the work and approval thereof by the Village.
(Ord. 1966-14. Passed 6-7-66.)
1024.06   APPROVAL OF PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED IN SOME CASES.
   Any applicant, other than a public utility, seeking permission to make a
street opening or to install or extend any facility on Village property beyond
the side line limits of his or her property shall first submit plans and
specifications therefor to Council, and obtain approval thereof by resolution
prior to commencement of the work. In the case of water service and sewer
connections in Business and Industrial Districts, plans and specifications
therefor shall be submitted to Council and its approval thereof obtained by
resolution prior to commencement of the work.

   The Street Commissioner is hereby given full jurisdiction, authority,
control, supervision and direction of all trees which now or which may
hereafter exist upon any public place in the Village and over all trees which
exist upon any private property in the Village when such trees constitute a
menace to the safety, health or welfare of the Village or any of its
inhabitants.
   The Commissioner may order the trimming, preservation or removal of trees or
other plants upon private property when such action is found necessary to
preserve the public safety, health or welfare, or to prevent the spread of
disease or insects to public trees and places.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)
1026.02   PLANTING, REMOVING, ETC.; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   The Street Commissioner shall have full jurisdiction, authority and control
in the issuance of permits as provided for herein.
   No person shall plant, remove, destroy, cut, prune, treat, feed, break,
climb, injure or spray any tree existing on any public place in the Village, or
authorize or procure any person to do so, or remove or tamper with any device
placed for the protection of a tree, or attach any rope, wire, chain, sign or
other device to a tree, or authorize or cause the same to be done, without
first obtaining a written permit therefor from the Commissioner.
   The permit, when granted for the planting of a tree on a public place in the
Village, shall designate the species of tree, the required spacing, the minimum
planting size and the type of support. No person shall guy a tree of less than
four inches in caliper with wire or rope. For trees over four inches in
caliper, special permission must be obtained and the permittee must assume
liability for incidents occurring therefrom.
   The application for a permit shall state the number and kind of trees to be
trimmed, sprayed, preserved, removed or planted, the kind of treatment to be
administered and such other information as the Commissioner finds reasonably
necessary to a fair determination of whether or not a permit should be issued.
   The Commissioner shall supervise all work done under a permit and may affix
reasonable conditions to a permit. The Commissioner may waive issuance of a
written permit if the application, in his or her opinion, is for relatively
minor work.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)
1026.03   TRIMMING REQUIRED.
   (a)   On Public Property. The Street Commissioner shall keep all trees
standing upon any public place in the Village trimmed so that the branches of
the trees projecting over any public sidewalk or private driveway or into any
public street beyond the curb line shall not conflict with the public welfare.
   (b)   On Private Property. All trees standing on private property in the
Village, which trees have branches projecting into public highways or other
public places, shall, under the supervision of the Commissioner, be trimmed by
the owner or occupant of the private property so that the lowest branches of
the trees are not less than nine feet from the ground where they overhang any
public walkway or public place, or less than thirteen feet over a public
highway.
   (c)   By Public Utilities. A public utility intending to trim trees on
public property shall submit a sketch or drawing showing the names of streets,
intersections, sides of streets and house numbers when it applies for a permit.
This information shall be submitted to Council's Road Committee for the
Committee's study before a permit can be issued. All costs of trimming and
inspection, if needed, shall be borne by the public utility.

1026.04   OBSTRUCTION OF VIEW AT INTERSECTIONS.

premises situated at the intersection of two or more streets or roadway rights
of way in the Village, any hedge, tree, shrub or other growth which may
obstruct the view of the operator of a motor vehicle approaching the
intersection so that the operator is unable to see vehicles or pedestrians
approaching or crossing the intersection. Such hedge, tree, shrub or growth is
hereby declared a public nuisance.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)
1026.05   PROHIBITED TREES.
   Any tree, and specifically silver maple, poplar and willow trees, upon
private property in the Village in such close proximity to a public place that
the roots of such tree penetrate through or under the surface of a public place
or into or around a public sewer in the Village, is hereby declared to be a
public nuisance and may be removed on orders of the Street Commissioner at the
expense of the owner or resident of the private property.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)
1026.06   MOVING OF TREES.
   Moving or removal of a tree on any public place in the Village made
necessary by the moving of a building or structure or any other private
enterprise, shall be done under the supervision of and with the written
permission of the Street Commissioner and at the expense of the applicant or
person seeking the removal of the tree. The applicant, as one of the conditions
to obtaining permission, shall deposit with the Village Clerk a sum in cash as
the Commissioner may determine and specify to cover all of the cost of moving,
removing and replacing the tree if replacement is found necessary. In lieu of a
cash deposit, the Commissioner may, at his or her discretion, accept a good and
sufficient bond to cover the entire cost of work involved.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)
1026.07   ORDERS TO TRIM, PRESERVE OR REMOVE TREES.
   When the Street Commissioner finds it necessary to order trimming,
preservation or removal of trees or plants on private property, he or she shall
serve a written order upon the owner, occupant or other responsible person.
   The order shall state a time limit for compliance. In cases of hazard to
humans or public property, the Commissioner shall require compliance
immediately upon service of the order.
   A person to whom an order is issued may, within twenty-four hours, appeal
the order to the Mayor, who shall review the order within three days and issue
his or her decision thereon. If the order is not revoked or modified it shall
be carried out forthwith.
   If a person to whom an order is directed fails to comply within the
specified time, the Commissioner may remedy the condition or contract with
others for the work to be done and charge the cost thereof to the person to
whom the order is directed. If such person does not pay for the work done, the
Village may take such remedial steps that it has to be reimbursed.
   Anyone remedying a condition under a contract made hereunder may enter
premises for the purpose of doing the prescribed work.
(Ord. 1977-9. Passed 4-5-77.)

(Ord. 2004-16. Passed 3-2-04.)
1043.10   MONITORING OR DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The Storm Water Management Administrator shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger
has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representative of the authorized
enforcement agent.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Storm Water Management
Administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes or
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.
      (3)   The Storm Water Management Administrator shall have the right to
set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the Administrator to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
storm water discharge.

      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Storm Water Management
Administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water
discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a
facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Storm Water Management Administrator has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and is able
to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agent may seek
issuance to a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the Municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the
use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge
of pollutants to the Municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm
water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part
of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2004-16. Passed 3-2-04.)
1043.12   WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.

for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the United
States. Said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agent in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the Storm Water Management Administrator within
three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.

the public right-of-way of the Village.
      (1)   Before claims are made against the performance bond or any sums are
withdrawn from the security fund, the Village shall give written notice to the
service provider:
         A.   Describing the act, default or failure to be remedied, or the
damages, cost or expenses which the Village has incurred by reason of the
service provider's act or default;
         B.   Providing a reasonable opportunity for the service provider to
first remedy the existing or ongoing default or failure, if applicable;
         C.   Providing a reasonable opportunity for the service provider to
pay any monies due the Village before the Village makes a claim against the
performance bond or withdraws the amount from the security fund, if applicable;
         D.   That the service provider will be given an opportunity to review
the act, default or failure described in the notice with the Mayor.
      (2)   Service providers shall maintain the full value of the performance
bond regardless of claims against the performance bond made by, or paid to, the
Village; or shall replenish the security fund within 14 days after written
notice from the Village that there is a deficiency in the amount of the fund,
whichever is applicable.
      (3)   Public utilities operating under a tariff issued by the State of
Ohio and regulated by PUCO and in compliance with PUCO Regulations concerning
insurance shall be exempt from any provision regarding a performance bond or
security fund for all tariff related activities.

of-way and defined portions thereof including the specific facilities and
location along the public right-of-way.
   (b)   Nonexclusive Consent to Occupy the Public Right-of-Way. No consent
granted under Section

occupy or use the public right-of-way of the Village to operate a system for
delivery of services or any other purposes.
   (c)   Rights Permitted. No consent granted under Section
1066.02 shall convey any right, title or interest in the public right-of-way,
but shall be deemed a consent only to occupy or use the public right-of-way for
the limited purposes granted by the consent. Further, no consent shall be
construed as any warranty of title. This chapter shall not affect the right to
occupy the public right-of-way granted to public utilities in connection with
the tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by PUCO said consent to
occupy the public right-of-way having been granted to such public utility by
the State of Ohio subject to only local regulation of matters of local concern.
   (d)   Nondiscrimination. A public service provider providing service to the
public in the Village shall make its services available to any customer within
the designated service area who shall request such service, without
discrimination as to the terms, conditions, rates or charges for the public
service provider's services; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
1066.05 shall prohibit a public service provider from making any reasonable
classifications among differently-situated customers.
   (e)   Maintenance of Facilities. Each service provider shall maintain its
system or facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies

behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other
measures as necessary and in accordance with applicable State and local

locate or maintain its facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use
of the public right-of-way by the Village, by the general public or by other
persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public right-of-way. All
such facilities shall be moved by the service provider, temporarily or
permanently, as determined by the Mayor, in accordance with applicable
provisions in the Ohio Revised Code and Ohio Law, and consistent with the
established rights of any public utility under Ohio Law.
   (h)   Damage to Public and Private Property. No service provider nor any
person acting on the service provider's behalf shall take any action or permit
any action to be done which may impair or damage any Village property, public
right-of-way, other ways or other public or private property located in, on or
adjacent thereto.
   (i)   Restoration of Public Right-of-Way, Other Ways and Village Property.
      (1)   When a service provider, or any person acting on its behalf, does
any work in or affecting any public right-of-way, other ways or Village
property, it shall, after the work is completed, promptly remove any
obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property, within 60 days, to as
good a condition as existed before the work was undertaken.
      (2)   If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete
restoration required by this section, the service provider shall temporarily

the service provider with respect to its facilities in the public right-of-way.
Public utilities operating under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and
regulated by PUCO and for tariff related activities will respond to the
Village's request for facility information through the OUPS Design Ticket
Process, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code.
   (k)   Leased Capacity. A service provider shall have the right, without
prior Village approval, to lease capacity or bandwidth to an unaffiliated
service provider, provided:
      (1)   The service provider shall notify the Village of the lease
agreement within 30 days of such lease agreement.
      (2)   The lessee has complied, to the extent applicable, with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (l)   Assignments or Transfers of Consent. Consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way may be, directly or indirectly, transferred, assigned or

      (3)   This section shall not apply to public utilities operating under a
tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by the PUCO where such
activities are regulated by the State of Ohio or Federal Agencies and such
public utility shall only be required to notify the Village when such transfer
has been approved by a regulatory body.
   (m)   Transactions Affecting Control of Consent. Any transactions that
singularly or collectively result in a change of 25% or more of the ownership
or ultimate working control of a service provider, of the ownership or working
control of the service provider's facility, or of control of the capacity or
bandwidth of the service provider's system, facilities or substantial parts
thereof, shall be considered an assignment or transfer pursuant to Section
1066.04(l) hereof. Transactions between affiliated entities are not exempt from
Section
1066.04(l).
   (n)   Revocation of Consent. Consent granted by the Village to occupy or use
the public right-of-way of the Village may be revoked, except as to public
utilities operating under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by
PUCO, for any one of the following reasons:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation at an unauthorized location;
      (2)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation in violation of Village safety and/or construction requirements;
      (3)   Material misrepresentation or lack of candor by or on behalf of a
service provider in any permit application or registration required by the
Village;

grounds exist for revocation of consent to occupy or use the public right-of-
way or construction permit, he or she shall give the service provider written
notice of the apparent violation or noncompliance, providing a short and
concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or
noncompliance, and providing the service provider a reasonable period of time
not less than 30 days to furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
(Ord. 2007-8. Passed 4-3-07.)
1066.05   LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities. All facilities shall be constructed,
reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Whenever possible according to acceptable engineering standards and
consistent with Federal and State law regarding safety and other matters,
facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible underground duct or
conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such facility.
      (2)   A service provider other than a public utility operating under a
tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by PUCO with permission to
install overhead facilities shall install its facilities on pole attachments to
existing utility poles only, and then only if surplus space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar facilities are located underground in a public right-of-way, a service
provider with permission to occupy the same public right-of-way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar facilities, must also
locate its facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for overhead facilities as provided herein other than a
public utility operating under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and
regulated by PUCO which may require above ground facilities for operational
reasons, no facilities shall be located above ground in a public right-of-way
without the express written permission of the Mayor.
      (5)   The Village reserves the right to require a service provider to
provide excess capacity in the public right-of-way at the time of construction,
reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce excavation in the public right-of-way, it
is the Village's goal to encourage service providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future facilities in the public right-of-way.
Therefore, if a service provider is constructing underground conduit in the
public right-of-way for its own facilities, and the Village reasonably
determines such construction is in an area in which other service providers
would likely construct facilities in the future, the Village may require the
service provider to construct the conduit in the public right-of-way with
excess capacity in the public right-of-way, provided the service provider shall
be reimbursed for the use of the excess capacity by another service provider.
The service provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of
the additional conduit space as reimbursement. This requirement shall not apply
where no practical operational, engineering or safety standard would support
the need for excess capacity.
   (c)   Village Owned Conduit. If the Village owns or leases conduit in the
path of a service provider's proposed facilities, and provided it is
technologically feasible for the service provider's facilities to occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the Village, the service provider shall be required
to occupy the conduit owned or leased by the Village in order to reduce the
necessity to excavate the public right-of-way. The service provider shall pay
to the Village a fee for such occupancy in accordance with and to the extent
permitted by Ohio R.C. 4939.05. The Village and the service provider may agree
to amortize the fee through annual payments to the Village.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within 120 days, or more for
larger projects, following written notice from the Village, and receipt of
final design plans and a construction schedule from the Village, and a signed
contract agreement between the public utility and the Village if reimbursement
is due from the Village, a service provider shall submit design plans and a
proposed construction schedule to the Village to temporarily or permanently
remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities in the public
right-of-way whenever the Village shall have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any Village or other public improvement in or upon the public
right-of-way;
      (2)   The operations of the Village or other governmental entity in or
upon the public right-of-way; and/or
      (3)   With regard to the expense of such removal or relocation, the
standard for reimbursement to the service provider for such expense shall be in
accordance with State law and regulations of PUCO.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the Village, any service provider or other person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized system, facility or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove
those facilities or appurtenances from the public right-of-way of the Village
or shall arrange to sell the system, facilities or appurtenances to the
Village. After the 30 days have expired, the Village may remove the facilities
or appurtenances from the public right-of-way at the other party's expense. A
system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider's consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a facility in the public right-of-way of the
Village, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and in accordance with State or Federal Law or regulations;
      (4)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a required construction
permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (5)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a public
right-of-way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the
Village's consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way or construction
permit;
      (6)   If the service provider fails to comply with the registration
requirements of Section
1066.03 of this chapter.

service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
eight hours, the service provider shall contact the Chief of Police to
coordinate traffic flow in the area of the service being conducted.
   (c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a service provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction or closing of
a public street, the service provider shall notify the Chief of Police, or
other responsible party, as promptly as possible after commencing such
emergency work. A service provider need not obtain a construction permit or
notify the Village prior to or after commencing any emergency work.

or her term as a member of Council and three electors of the Village to be
appointed by the Mayor for terms of six years each, except that the term of one
of the members of the first Commission shall be for four years and one for two
years. The appointed three electors shall be compensated at the rate of four
hundred dollars ($400.00) annually, plus thirty dollars ($30.00) for each
meeting attended, with a maximum of ten compensated meetings per year. All
compensation is to be paid quarterly. The Secretary of the Commission shall

appointment within 45 days to fill the vacancy, Council may fill the vacancy by
a majority vote. The Mayor shall notify Council of the appointment within the
45-day time period to satisfy this provision. Council's failure to confirm any
appointment of the Mayor shall result in a new, 45-day time period for the
Mayor to present a new appointment. Where the outgoing Commission Member has
served with distinction and desires to continue their service to the Village,
the Mayor and Council shall reserve the right to give priority to that
applicant in considering their reappointment to another term. Letters of
interest may be completed and submitted to the Mayor by residents who are
interested in the open seat on the Planning Commission. All letters of interest
will be open for public review.

required by these Subdivision Regulations in accordance with the procedure,
standards and specifications established by the Village and shall make a
deposit of money with the Clerk to cover the expenses of the Village in

subdivider. The Commission shall determine whether the final plat is found to
conform with the preliminary plat, as approved, and with the requirements set
forth in these Subdivision Regulations, and if so found, shall approve the
same, and the Secretary of the Commission shall endorse such approval on the
final plat and all copies and refer the same to Council. If the final plat is
disapproved, the Secretary shall attach to the plat a statement of the reasons
for such action and return it to the subdivider. In either case, the records of
the Commission shall show all action taken, together with the reason therefor.

1244.03   ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Council shall approve the proposed subdivision on determination by it
that the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations have been complied with.
When streets, rights of way, easements and other interests in land are offered
for dedication for public use, Council shall indicate acceptance of such
dedication by ordinance, which shall require a title guarantee furnished by the
subdivider at his or her cost and which shall further provide for the filing of
the final plat with the Recorder of Cuyahoga County upon the issuance of such
title guarantee, all at the cost of the subdivider. An appropriate notation of
the acceptance of the dedication of such streets or other interests shall be
made on the face of the final plat and all copies and shall be signed by the
Mayor and the Clerk.
   (b)   Two of the reproductions of the final plat shall be returned to the

1246.01   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LAYOUT OF SUBDIVISIONS.
   In the laying out of a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the
following principles and requirements:
   (a)   The subdivision layout shall conform to any Major Street Plan in
effect at the time of submission of the plat.
   (b)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a principal or
secondary street, such part of such street shall be platted by the subdivider
in its existing location and at the width indicated in Section
1246.03.
   (c)   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site or other
public ground shown on any Major Street Plan, in effect at the time of
submission of the plat, is located in whole or in part within the proposed
subdivision, such proposed public ground or park shall be dedicated to the
Village or reserved for acquisition by the Village within a period of three
years by purchase or other compensatory means according to law.
   (d)   Private streets shall not be approved nor shall public improvements be
approved for any private street.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
   (e)   Names of new streets shall be approved by the Commission, unless a new
street is a continuation of, or in alignment with, an existing or platted
street. House numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the house numbering
system in effect in the Village.
(Ord. 1994-31. Passed 1-17-95.)
   (f)   All remnants of lots must be added to adjacent lots, rather than
allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (g)   Lots subject to flooding and lots deemed by the Planning Commission to
be uninhabitable, shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the
flood hazard, but such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
1246.02   STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (a)   The street layout of the subdivision, in the absence of a Major Street
Plan, shall promote the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and
the entire neighborhood.
   (b)   As far as practicable, all proposed streets shall be continuous and in
alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to
connect.
   (c)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout, or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts. Cul-de-sac streets of reasonable length will be approved where
necessitated by topography or where, in the opinion of the Commission, they are
appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
   (d)   Proposed streets shall follow the contour of the land wherever
practicable.
   (e)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles
as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
   (f)   Whenever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided a
dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street, the other half-width of
such street shall be platted, unless, in the opinion of the Commission, it is
not in the public interest to do so.
   (g)   Where the development of a subdivision involves the extension of an
existing cul-de-sac street, the subdivider shall bear all costs of removing the
turning circle and bringing that portion of the street to a condition of
uniform width of pavement and right-of-way, including, but not limited to, any
necessary removal of pavement, relocation of ditches and regrading.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
1246.03   RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS OF STREETS; SERVICE DRIVES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   The minimum right-of-way width of all streets shall be 60 feet,
provided that such minimum may be increased by the Planning Commission if
deemed necessary because of unusual conditions or anticipated traffic volume.
   (b)   All cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a circular turn-around
having a minimum right-of-way diameter of 100 feet.
   (c)   Easements for utilities shall be provided along rear and side lot
lines wherever practicable. Such easements shall be at least 10 feet wide.
   (d)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage way, channel or stream,
a storm water easement or drainage right of way, conforming substantially with
the lines of such watercourse, shall be provided. The easement or right of way
shall be 20 feet wide, or of such additional width as is adequate for the
purpose, and shall be generally parallel with rear lot lines.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
1246.04   WIDTHS OF PAVEMENTS.
   (a)   Pavement surfaces shall be a minimum of 22 feet, centered in the right
of way, provided that such minimum may be increased by the Planning Commission
if deemed necessary because of unusual conditions or anticipated traffic
volume.
   (b)   The turning circle at the end of a cul-de-sac street shall be
completely paved and shall have a minimum outside diameter of 75 feet.
(Ord. 1994-31. Passed 1-17-95; Ord. 2000-6. Passed 4-18-00; Ord. 2001-7. Passed
4-3-01.)
1246.05   INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   At street intersections property line corners shall be rounded by an
arc, the minimum radius of which shall be 20 feet.
   (b)   Street curb or street pavement intersections shall be rounded by radii
of at least 37½ feet.
   (c)   The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle of
intersection is less than 60 degrees, or in any case where the Planning
Commission considers an increase necessary.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65; Ord. 2000-6. Passed 4-18-00; Ord. 2001-7. Passed
4-3-01.)
1246.06   LOTS.
   (a)   The size and shape of lots shall be appropriate for the location of
the proposed subdivision and for the type of development contemplated. Lots
shall also be of adequate size to comply with the requirements of the Zoning
Code and any amendments thereto.
   (b)   Every lot shall abut on a street dedicated and accepted for public
use.
   (c)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the
right-of-way line of the street on which the lot faces.
   (d)   Corner lots shall be platted wider than interior lots, in order to
permit conformance with the front yard depth on the side street required by the
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
1246.07   IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   No dedication of a street shall be accepted, nor shall the subdivision
of any land be approved until the improvements set forth in this section have
been completed, or provisions satisfactory to three-fourths of the members
elected to Council have been made, guaranteeing the satisfactory completion of
such improvements in conformity with these Subdivision Regulations, for all
streets and roadways in such subdivision.
   (b)   All proposed streets shall be constructed in conformity with the
requirements of
Chapter 1022 of these Codified Ordinances and of any ordinance in effect on the
date of approval of the preliminary plat which amends or supersedes
Chapter 1022. Where a street is extended to the boundary line of a subdivision
with a reasonable expectation that the street may be further extended in the
future development of adjacent land, provisions shall be made to facilitate the
future extension of water mains and sewer systems.
   (c)   Water mains, meeting the approval of the Village Engineer and of the
City of Cleveland, Department of Public Utilities, shall be installed. The term
"water mains", as used in this section, includes fire hydrants, valves and
other necessary appurtenances. If, in the opinion of Council, it is not
possible to install water mains as specified above, then such subdivision or
plat thereof may be approved without such improvement by the affirmative vote
of three-fourths of all members elected to Council, provided that a suitable
surety bond or other security acceptable to Council and approved by the
Solicitor, equal to 110 percent of the cost of such improvement, as estimated
by the Village Engineer, shall be deposited with the Clerk to assure completion
of the improvement within the time fixed by Council. Such bond or security
shall indemnify the Village from any liability arising by reason of the
unimproved condition of the street, or which may arise or grow out of the
installation of such improvement.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65.)
   (d)   Sanitary facilities shall be installed as follows:
      (1)   The subdivision shall be provided with a complete sewer system,
connected to a sewer main in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District (NEORSD) and the Village. No storm flow or seepage water shall be
discharged into any sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Isolated property, where a public sewer main is not readily
accessible, shall be provided with drainage systems as may be required to
provide a suitable point of discharge for a private sewage system. Suitability
shall be established by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health in accordance with
its regulations in effect at the time of preliminary plat approval.
(Ord. 1994-31. Passed 1-17-95.)
   (e)   Permanent monuments, as described below, shall be accurately set and
established at such points as will enable any skilled surveyor correctly to lay
out any lot in the subdivision. Locations of such monuments shall include, but
shall not necessarily be limited to, the intersection of the boundary lines of
the subdivision with all street lines, at least two diagonally opposite corners
of each street intersection, the intersections of all outside boundary lines of
the plat and the beginning and end of all curves. In addition, iron pins shall
be set at all lot corners. Monuments shall be constructed in accordance with
acceptable standards. The points at which such monuments may be found shall be
designated on the plat.
   (f)   Materials used for construction of any improvement shall be tested in
accordance with the standards used by the Village for general improvements
undertaken by it. Any costs incurred for such testing shall be borne by the
owner or developer.
   (g)   Any detail of construction which is not specifically governed by an
ordinance of the Village shall be in accordance with the specifications
normally used by the Village in its own improvements, and shall be subject to
approval by the Village Engineer.
   (h)   Complete plans and specifications for each improvement shall be
submitted, at least thirty days before commencement of construction of such
improvement, to the Clerk for approval of the Village Engineer. All
improvements shall be constructed and installed in conformity with the plans
and specifications approved by the Village Engineer and no modifications shall
be allowed except upon his or her written approval. All improvements shall be
constructed under the supervision of the Village Engineer or of an inspector
duly appointed by the Mayor.
(Ord. 1965-17. Passed 7-20-65; Ord. 2000-6. Passed 4-18-00; Ord. 2001-7. Passed
4-3-01.)
   (i)   The subdivider shall guarantee the construction and materials of all
public improvements for a period of 24 months, after acceptance by the Village.
To secure the guarantee, the subdivider shall provide to the Village a
maintenance bond in an amount equal to 25 percent of the total cost of
construction of such improvements. The bond surety provider shall be licensed
to do business in the State of Ohio and approved by the Village.
(Ord. 1994-31. Passed 1-17-95; Ord. 2001-7. Passed 4-3-01.)
1246.08   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Application by the owner or subdivider for any variance from the
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations, or from any pertinent ordinance
or regulation referred to herein, shall be submitted in writing, with reasons
therefor, with the preliminary plat, for the consideration of the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   Where the subdivider can show that, by reason of exceptional
topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with any
requirement of these Subdivision Regulations would cause practical difficulty
or undue hardship, the Commission may relax such requirements to the extent
deemed just and proper, so as to alleviate such difficulty or hardship,
provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good
and without impairing the intent and purposes of these Subdivision Regulations,
the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the community, any
Major Street Plan in effect at the time of the submission of the plat and the
Zoning Code. Any variance thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the
Commission setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Commission,
justify the variance.
   (c)   The Commission may make the granting of such relief or variance
subject to any conditions and safeguards as the Commission may deem necessary.

Zoning Code; and, when required, after the lawful issuance of the certificate
(s) and/or permit(s) required by this Zoning Code.

with the provisions of this Code shall be included as part of a required
setback, parking area, or other space required under this Code for another
building or structure.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1250.05   RELATIONSHIP TO PLANS.
   It is the intention of the Legislative Authority that this Zoning Code
implement the planning policies reflected in the Village of Walton Hills Master
Plan and other planning documents. While the Legislative Authority reaffirms
its commitment that this Zoning Code, as amended, be in conformity with adopted
planning policies, the Legislative Authority hereby expresses its intent that
neither this Zoning Code nor any amendment to it may be challenged on the basis
of any alleged nonconformity with any planning document.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1250.06   SEPARABILITY.
   Sections and sub-sections of this Zoning Code and the several parts or
provisions thereof are hereby declared to be independent sections, sub-
sections, parts, and provisions. If any provision of this Zoning Code, or
amendment thereto, or any application of any provision to particular
circumstances is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this Zoning Code or amendments thereto, or the
application of such provision to other circumstances.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1250.07   INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   Unless specifically noted otherwise, in interpreting and applying the
provisions of this Zoning Code, these provisions shall be considered the
minimum requirements necessary for the promotion of the public health, safety,

and objectives set forth herein and the purposes and intent of each district as
set forth in each district chapter.
   (b)   Except as specifically provided herein, the provisions of this Zoning
Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with
any existing deed or plat restrictions, ordinances, laws, rules, or permits
previously adopted or issued, and shall not be construed as removing or
rendering inoperative any deed or land restriction formerly established by
restrictive covenants running with the land, easements, or other agreements
between parties.
   (c)   In cases where this Zoning Code imposes a greater restriction than is
imposed or required by such other laws or ordinances, or by such rules and
regulations, the provisions of this Zoning Code shall govern. Conversely, other
regulations shall govern where they are more restrictive in nature than this
Zoning Code.
   (d)   If the provisions of this Zoning Code are inconsistent with one
another, the more restrictive provision shall control.
   (e)   All prior violations of the Zoning Code repealed by the adoption of
this Planning and Zoning Code shall remain violations and all penalties and
enforcement remedies set forth herein shall be available to the Village as
though the violation were a violation of this Zoning Code. Provided, however,
that if the effect of this Zoning Code is to make a use, building, lot,
structure, or condition that was formerly unlawful or non-conforming, become
lawful and/or conforming, then no enforcement action shall be taken except for
the imposition and collection of penalties, for the violations that occurred
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1250.08   EFFECTIVE DATE.

   This chapter includes procedures to ensure that the provisions and
regulations, set forth in this Zoning Code, be soundly and consistently applied
and that this Code be vigorously administered. This chapter includes procedures
to be followed in obtaining zoning permits; certificates of zoning compliance,
conditional zoning certificates; development plan approval; an appeal or

are:
   (a)   To establish the procedures for reviewing and acting upon applications
for zoning permits, including certificates of compliance, in order to
accomplish the purposes for which this Zoning Code is adopted.
   (b)   To provide adequate review of proposed developments in those zoning

effect on surrounding property, that review of specific development plans is
deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
   (c)   To establish procedures for reviewing applications for a conditional
use. These procedures are necessary because some uses, as set forth in the
district regulations, are classified as conditional uses thereby requiring a
separate review process utilizing the guidelines outlined in this chapter.

order to approve a development plan, the Planning Commission shall consider
such factors as:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with any plan for the orderly development of
the Village and conforms in all respects to the regulations of this Zoning
Code.
      (2)   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to
the area will be safeguarded.
      (3)   The development will result in a harmonious grouping of buildings
within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and proposed
uses on adjacent property.
      (4)   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property.
      (5)   The development will have adequate public service, parking, and
open spaces.
      (6)   The development will preserve and be sensitive to the natural
characteristics of the site in a manner that complies with the applicable
regulations set forth in this Zoning Code.

ingress/egress to the development shall be controlled and designed in such
manner as to minimize conflicts with adjacent properties and developments.
      (9)   Adequate provision is made for emergency vehicle access and
circulation;
      (10)   The proposed signs, when part of a sign plan, are:
         A.   An appropriate size, scale, and design in relationship with the
principal building, site, and surroundings;
         B.   Adequately identify the use; and,
         C.   Located to maintain safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular
circulation.
      (11)   The landscape plan will adequately:
         A.   Enhance the principal building and site;
         B.   Maintain existing trees to the extent possible;
         C.   Buffer adjacent incompatible uses;
         D.   Break up large expanses of pavement with natural material; and,
         E.   Provide appropriate plant materials considering the ultimate
mature size and shape of plants relative to the buildings and site, and the

water courses and drainage areas, and shall comply with the applicable
regulations in this Zoning Code and any other design criteria established by
the Village or any other governmental entity which may have jurisdiction over
such matters.
      (13)   Site lighting is designed to minimize direct light, glare, and
excessive glow, which unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of
adjacent property. If it is determined that, once the project is completed, the
lighting does have unreasonable adverse impact on adjacent property, the Zoning
Administrator may order reasonable alterations to the site lighting (such as
reduced illumination, shielding, landscaping, etc.) to mitigate such
unreasonable impacts;
      (14)   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage shall be so planned that the foregoing criteria are complied with at the

of approval. If, at the end of that time, construction of the development has
not begun, then approval of such development plan shall expire and shall be of
no effect unless resubmitted and re-approved in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this chapter. Construction is deemed to have begun when all
necessary excavation and piers or footings of one or more principal buildings
included in the plan have been completed.
   (i)   Simultaneous Plat Approval. If the proposed development includes the
subdivision of land, the development shall be subject to the requirements of
the plat approval process in accordance with subdivision regulations in the
Planning and Zoning Code. Development plan approval and subdivision plat
approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
   (j)   Approval of Development Plan Requiring Variances. If an application
for development plan approval requires approval of both a development plan and
a variance, the applicant shall seek approval of the development plan first.
   (k)   Equivalency Provision. In reviewing an application for development
plan approval, the Planning Commission may find that a development plan either
adheres or is equivalent to the requirements of this Zoning Code.

to be equivalent to a requirement if:
         A.   The proposed development plan substantially complies with all
specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic objectives of the
zoning district;
         B.   Through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, as disclosed
by the application, the proposal results in a development of equivalent or
higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict application of
such standards and requirements; and,
         C.   The development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon
the surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the
community.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate to
the Planning Commission that the provisions of this section have been
satisfied. When evaluating the application with respect to this section, the
Planning Commission shall make any finding of equivalency in writing which
explains how and why the proposal has satisfied the above criteria. When making
such finding, the Commission may approve the proposed application as if the
application were in strict compliance with the standards and requirements in
this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Approval under this section is not a variance. Instead, this
subsection allows applicants to satisfy zoning requirements in ways not
anticipated by the Village.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1258.06   SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Zoning Code and amendments
thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each other, are
permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are created and
are not addressed by this Zoning Code, this section provides the procedure by
which the Planning Commission may make a determination that a new use is
similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)   Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use is in compliance with
the following provisions:

statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district;
      (4)   The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)   Assignment to Districts. If the Planning Commission approves the
proposed similar use, then the similar use shall be added to those districts
that allow the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as identified
in the Planning Commission's determination.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1258.07   CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT .
   When a proposed use is permitted as a conditional use in the zoning district
in which it is proposed to be located, as set forth in the district
regulations, a conditional zoning certificate is required and the application
for such conditional zoning certificate shall be submitted and reviewed
according to the procedures in this Section.
   (a)   Submission of An Application for a Conditional Use Permit. The owner
or agent thereof, of property for which such conditional use is proposed, shall
file with the Zoning Administrator an application for a conditional use permit

      (2)   A development plan and associated documents as required by Section
1258.05 (e), unless specific items required in Section
1258.05 (e) are determined by the Zoning Administrator to be inapplicable or
unnecessary and are waived in writing by the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Conditional Use Permit Application Procedures.
      (1)   Review for Completeness. Within twenty days after receiving an
application for a conditional use, the Zoning Administrator shall review the
submitted application for completeness and compliance with the applicable
submission requirements. If the application is deemed insufficient, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the necessary changes or additional
information needed. When the application is deemed complete and the application
fee has been paid, the Zoning Administrator shall officially accept the
application for consideration of the action(s) requested on the date such
determination is made and place it on the Planning Commission's agenda for a
public hearing as required by subsection
1258.07 (c).
      (2)   Distribution of Plans. When the Zoning Administrator determines
that the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the
application to appropriate Village departments and professional consultants for
review and comment. Any reports, comments, or expert opinions shall be returned
to the Zoning Administrator within ten days from the date the application is
deemed complete.
      (3)   Transmission to the Planning Commission. The Zoning Administrator
shall distribute the application for a conditional use and any reports prepared
by the individuals in subsection (2) above to the Planning Commission, at least
three days prior to the time of the Commission's review at their next regularly
scheduled meeting.
   (c)   Public Hearing and Notice by Planning Commission for Conditional Uses.
The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed conditional
use. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by first class mail to the
applicant and to the property owners within 500 feet of the property on which
the use is proposed. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate
action taken on such application. Further notice shall be given in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the Village. All notices shall be made at
least ten days before the date of said public hearing. All notices shall set
forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed
conditional use. The Commission may recess such hearings from time to time,
and, if the time and place of the continued hearing is publicly announced at
the time of the adjournment, no further notice shall be required.
   (d)   Review of Conditional Use Permit Application. The Planning Commission
shall review the proposed conditional use, as presented on the submitted plans
and specifications, to determine whether or not the proposed use is appropriate
and in keeping with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall review the development plan for the
proposed conditional use according to the development plan review criteria set
forth in Section
1258.05 (f), Criteria for Reviewing Development Plans, as applicable;
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall review the application to determine
if the establishment and operation of the proposed use complies with the
general and specific criteria established for all conditional uses and the
specific requirements established for that particular use, as set forth in
Chapter 1294, Conditional Use Permit Regulations, of this Zoning Code; and
      (3)   The Planning Commission may require the applicant to submit such
additional information as deemed necessary including the carrying out of
special studies and the provisions of expert advice.
   (e)   Action by the Planning Commission on Conditional Uses. The Planning
Commission shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)   If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Planning
Commission to be appropriate and in conformance with the review criteria
outlined in
Chapter 1294, the Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use permit.
As part of the approval, the Planning Commission may prescribe reasonable
requirements on the proposed use to ensure that the development conforms to the
intent and purposes of Sections
1294.01,
1294.02 and
1294.03. The Planning Commission may approve the application for a conditional
use without approving the submitted development plan, which shall be
subsequently approved pursuant to the procedures in this chapter.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall deny the application if the Planning
Commission concludes that, if completed as proposed, the development will not
be in compliance with the requirements of this Zoning Code. Such action shall
be stated in writing and include specific findings, based upon the evidence
submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
   (f)   Failure of the Planning Commission to Act. If the Planning Commission
fails to act within sixty days from the date the application was deemed
complete, or an extended period as may be agreed upon, then the applicant may
deem the development denied.
   (g)   Terms and Duration of Conditional Use Permit Approval.
      (1)   Conditional use approval shall authorize the applicant and /or his,
hers or its successor in interest a particular conditional use on a specific
parcel. Approval of a conditional use, pursuant to this chapter, shall be valid
only for the use and the operation of such use as specified when granted by the
Planning Commission. The breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement
shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Code. Approval shall automatically
be void if, for any reason, the conditional use shall cease for more than one
year.
      (2)   The conditional use permit approval shall expire one year from the
date of enactment, unless:
         A.   The development plan is approved for uses that require a
development plan;
         B.   Substantial progress in the establishment of the use is
accomplished; or
         C.   As otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Conditional Use Changes. Except as noted throughout this Code, all
exterior alterations and additions to existing non-residential conditional uses
shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. Also, at the Zoning
Administrator's discretion, any interior alteration to an existing non-
residential conditional use that requires additional parking spaces to be
provided may be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.
   (h)   Re-application for a Conditional Use Approval. The Zoning
Administrator shall accept no re-application for a conditional use unless the
re-application is based on a revised application that addresses the
justification for the denial of the initial application. A re-application shall
comply with all the requirements of this chapter, including payment of the
required fee. If an application is denied as a result of Section
1258.07 (f), Failure of the Planning Commission to Act, the Zoning
Administrator shall accept a re-application for a conditional use that has not
been revised from the previous submittal.

(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1258.09   VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest according to the following procedures:
   (a)   Application Requirements. An application for a variance shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator for review by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon
the forms provided and shall be accompanied by the following requirements
necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested variance:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest, or written authority;
      (3)   Legal description of property or portion thereof;
      (4)   Identification of the zoning district in which the property is
located.
      (5)   Description or nature of variance requested;
      (6)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to the applicable criteria in
subsections
1258.09 (c)(1) or
1258.09 (c)(2), as applicable;
      (7)   A plan, neatly and legibly drawn to adequately depict the
information showing the following, where applicable:
         A.   The street providing access to the lot and the exact location of
the lot in relation to the nearest cross street.
         B.   The name of the subject plan, if any, and the lot numbers of the
subject and abutting properties.
         C.   The actual dimensions of the lot, the setbacks and other open
space dimensions thereof and the location and size of any existing structure
thereon.
         D.   The location and size of the proposed structure, and/or the
proposed enlargement and existing structure.
         E.   The location and size of the parking area and the circulation
layout.
         F.   The proposed landscaping, signs, and any other uses on the
property.
         G.   An elevation drawing for any proposed new structures or major
additions.
         H.   Any other information, including but not limited to floor plans,
elevations and other drawings at a reasonable scale to convey the need for the
variance, which, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, may be necessary
to provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Code.
      (8)   Payment of the application fee;
      (9)   A list of all property owners lying within 500 feet of any part of
the property on which the variance is proposed, including their addresses and
permanent parcel numbers and lot numbers; and,
      (10)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Review of Completeness. Within twenty days after receiving an
application for variance, the Zoning Administrator shall review the submitted
application for completeness and compliance with the applicable submission
requirements. If the application is deemed insufficient, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the necessary changes or additional
information needed. When the application is deemed complete and the application
fee has been paid, the Zoning Administrator shall officially accept the
application for consideration of the action(s) requested on the date such
determination is made and place it on the Board of Zoning Appeals' agenda.
   (c)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in Section
1258.08, the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same. The
Board shall review each application for a variance to determine if it complies
with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and evidence demonstrates that
the literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will result in practical difficulty
or unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Area Variance. For area variances, the following factors shall be
considered and weighed by the Board to determine practical difficulty:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity;
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot; or proximity to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions.
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         G.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         H.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         I.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
         J.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
         K.   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Code.
      (2)   Use Variance. In order to grant a use variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall determine that strict compliance with the terms of this Code will
result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate
such hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the criteria in
subsection
1258.09 (c)(2) A. are satisfied. The applicant may also demonstrate hardship by
use of the criteria in
1258.09 (c)(2) B.
         A.   The applicant shall demonstrate hardship with the following:
            1.   The variance requested stems from a condition that is unique
to the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
            2.   The granting of the variance will not have any material
adverse affect on the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
            3.   The granting of the variance will not have any material
adverse affect on the public health, safety or general welfare of the Village
of Walton Hills;
            4.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of the Code; and,
            5.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to
the applicant.
         B.   The applicant may submit evidence and the Board may also
consider:
            1.   Whether the property cannot be put to any economically viable
use under any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the
property is located; and,
            2.   Whether, and the extent to which (if applicable), the hardship
condition is not created by actions of the applicant.
   (d)   Requests for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
   (e)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies
will be met.
   (f)   Action by the Board. The Board shall act according to the procedures
established for appeals in Section
1258.08 (g).
      (1)   The Board shall:
         A.   Approve;
         B.   Approve with supplementary conditions; or,
         C.   Disapprove the request for a variance.
      (2)   The Board shall further make specific findings of fact based
directly on the particular evidence presented that the reasons set forth in the
application and as presented by the applicant during the public hearing,
justify the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use
of the land, building, or structure.
      (3)   The Board shall have the power, in specific cases, to vary the
application of certain provisions of this Code in order that the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice
done.
   (g)   Terms and Extension of Variance. Variances shall expire one year from
the date of their enactment, unless prior thereto, the applicant commences
construction in accordance with the granted variance or an extension of time
has been granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Construction is deemed to have
begun when all necessary excavation and piers or footings of one or more
principal buildings included on the approved plan have been completed. There
shall be no modification of variances except by further consideration of the
Board. Once the time limit pursuant to this Section has expired, a request for
a variance shall be considered to be a new application for a variance and shall
meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to this section.
   (h)   Appeal of Board's Decision. Any person aggrieved by any action or
decision of the Board under this Zoning Code including the Village or any
officer or official thereof, or upon the direction of the Legislative Authority
or the Mayor may appeal any such action or decision to the Court of Common
Pleas under Ohio R. C. Ch. 2506.

streets or alleys, but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be
construed to be the boundary of such district;
   (c)   Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of

1266.08   HOME OCCUPATION REGULATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations which control the
establishment and operation of home occupations. The intent of these
regulations is to control the non-residential use of a residential dwelling
unit so that the non-residential use is limited to an accessory use, and shall
not in any way adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential district
of which they are a part. Compliance with these regulations should result in
all home occupations being located and conducted in such a manner that their
existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside of the dwelling
unit. Home occupations shall be a permitted accessory use when conducted in
compliance with the following standards. When not in compliance with the
following standards, such home occupation shall be declared a nuisance pursuant
to the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Walton Hills.
   (a)   Home occupations shall be clearly incidental and secondary in
importance to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes.
   (b)   The occupation shall be conducted wholly within the principal building
and the space used for production and sale shall not occupy more than twenty-
five percent of the net floor area of the dwelling unit.

   The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots, structures, and conditions that lawfully existed at the time
of this Zoning Code's enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not
conform with one or more of the regulations contained in this Zoning Code. Non-
conforming status is considered to be incompatible with permitted uses,
buildings, lots, conditions, and structures. Therefore, non-conforming uses,
buildings, lots, structures and site conditions are subject to regulations
limiting their use, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution.
The regulations in this chapter are established in order to achieve the
following purposes:
   (a)   To permit the continuance, but control of non-conforming uses so as to
minimize any adverse effects the uses might have on the adjoining properties
and development;
   (b)   To regulate the maintenance and repair of non-conforming uses and
structures;
   (c)   To regulate the rebuilding of non-conforming uses and structures, if
substantially destroyed;
   (d)   To require the permanent discontinuance of non-conforming uses, if not
operated for certain periods of time;
   (e)   To bring about eventual conformity of all uses in accordance with the
objectives of the Master Plan and Zoning Code of the Village; and,
   (f)   To establish regulations for the development of non-conforming lots.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.02   LAWFUL NON-CONFORMANCE.
   (a)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building or structure, and of any land
or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enacting this Code, or any
amendments thereto, may be continued although such use does not conform to the
provisions of this Code. The completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension
or substitution of non-conforming uses shall be subject to the provisions and
conditions set forth in this chapter and this Code.
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter shall also apply to any building,
structure, land, site condition, or other use hereafter becoming non-conforming
as a result of amendments made to this Zoning Code or Zoning Map.
   (c)   A non-conforming lot, use, building, site condition, or structure does
not include non-conformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted
variance from a zoning regulation.
   (d)   Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a non-conforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a non-conforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.03   NON-CONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR LAND.
   A non-conforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful
and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
regulations:
   (a)   Change or Substitution to Another Non-conforming Use. A non-conforming
use of a building, structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to
another non-conforming use unless:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, on appeal, finds that the use proposed
is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
non-conforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
non-conforming use, and that the proposed substitution is of no greater
intensity than the previous use, pursuant to the criteria in Section
1274.03(c)(1), Expanding Non-conforming Uses and Structures. In permitting such
change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accordance with other provisions of this Zoning Code and make
such a part of the terms under which the change is granted.
         A.   Whenever a non-conforming use is changed to a less intensive use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive non-conforming
use.
         B.   Whenever a non-conforming use is changed to a use permitted in
the district in which the lot is located, it shall cease to be considered a
non-conforming use. Upon such compliance, no non-conforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
         C.   Violation of any conditions and/or safeguards prescribed shall be
deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and shall be punishable under
Chapter 1260, Enforcement and Penalty.
      (2)   An application is filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals and such
application includes payment of the fee established by the Village, and the
items required in Section
1258.09, Variances.
   (b)   Land Occupied by Non-conforming Use.
      (1)   Expansion of Non-conforming Use of Land. A non-conforming use of
land shall not be physically enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a
greater area of land than was occupied by the use at the time it became non-
conforming.
      (2)   Relocation of Non-conforming Use of Land. A non-conforming use of
land shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than those portions occupied by the use at the time it became non-
conforming.
   (c)   Structures Occupied by Non-conforming Use.
      (1)   Expanding Non-conforming Uses within Structures. Upon approval by
the Board of Zoning Appeals, a non-conforming use of an existing structure may
be extended throughout any parts of a building that were arranged or designed
for such use at the time of adoption or amendment to this Zoning Code, provided
the intensity of the non-conforming use is not increased and no such use shall
be extended to occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by
such non-conforming use. In determining whether intensity of use is increased,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following:
         A.   Hours of operation;
         B.   Volume and type of sales;
         C.   Type of processing activity;
         D.   Nature and location of storage;
         E.   Traffic generation by volume, type, and characteristics;
         F.   Parking and loading characteristics; and
         G.   Noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes.
      (2)   Expansion of Building(s). No such building shall be enlarged or
expanded to increase the non-conforming use. No additional structures shall be
constructed in connection with such a non-conforming use.
      (3)   Alteration or Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Non-
conforming Use. No building or structure occupied by a non-conforming use shall
be altered, improved, or reconstructed except when:
         A.   The use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which it
is located; or,
         B.   The building, or portion thereof, is demolished by any means that
is not the voluntary action of the property owner, in which case the building
(s) may be reconstructed substantially the same as existed prior to
destruction. Substantially the same is related to the building size and
setbacks, the number of parking spaces, parking setbacks, driveway locations,
landscaping, screening, etc. Such reconstruction shall be approved by the
Planning Commission and such reconstruction pursuant to this section shall not
be unreasonably withheld.
   (d)   Discontinuance of Use. Whenever a non-conforming use of a building,
part of a building, lot or part of a lot is discontinued for more than one
year, such discontinuance shall constitute abandonment of such use and any
subsequent use of the building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot shall
conform to the use regulations specified by this Code for the district in which
such land is located.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.04   NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A non-conforming building or structure may continue to be used or occupied
by a use permitted in the district in which it is located so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the
following provisions:
   (a)   Additions and Moving. A non-conforming building or structure shall not
be added to, enlarged or moved unless the addition(s) or part(s) moved conforms
to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a non-conforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, which is not a
voluntary action of the property owner, those portions so destroyed or damaged
may be restored substantially the same as existed prior to destruction,
provided the reconstruction is begun within twelve months of the damage or
destruction. Substantially the same is related to the building size and
setbacks, the number of parking spaces, parking setbacks, landscaping,
screening, etc. Any restoration that exceeds the original footprint and/or
floor area shall comply with subsection
1274.04(a).
   (c)   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a non-
conforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the district
in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all regulations of
this Zoning Code specified for such use, except the regulations to which the
building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   Variances from district regulations on area, lot coverage, lot width,
height, setbacks, yards, location on the lot may be granted by the Board Zoning
Appeals where necessary and where such appeal for a variance meets the
requirements of subsection
1258.09(c)(1), Area Variance. The Zoning Administrator may allow the extension
of an existing non-conforming building line if the extension maintains the same
or creates a greater distance from the lot line.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.05   NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that, on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, does not comply with the lot area and/or lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
   (a)   Existing Buildings on Lots of Record.
      (1)   Existing Building on a Nonresidential Lot. If the lot is occupied
by a building, such building shall be maintained and may be repaired,
modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in
floor area unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this
Zoning Code, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in
which the lot is located.
      (2)   Existing Building on a Residential Lot in the Country Home
District. If the lot in the Country Home District is occupied by a building,
such building shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or altered,
provided that the building shall not be enlarged in floor area unless the
enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this Zoning Code, except
for the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in which the lot is
located.
         A.   Structural alterations or extensions of a residential structure,
which is non-conforming only by reason of lot size or lot width, shall be
permitted upon approval of the Zoning Administrator.
         B.   The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless all
regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
   (b)   Vacant Single Non-conforming Lot of Record.
      (1)   Single Non-conforming Lot of Record in the Country Home District. A
vacant, non-conforming lot in the Country Home District that is in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership
shall be permitted to be developed as a site for a single-family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings.
         A.   Such dwelling and its accessory uses shall comply with all
regulations of this Zoning Code, except for the lot area and lot width
regulations of the district in which the lot is located.
         B.   Review and approval of development on such lots of record shall
be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Section
1258.04, Zoning Permit for a Single-Family Detached Dwelling or Use Accessory
Thereto.
         C.   Variances of requirements from district regulations, other than
lot area or lot width, shall be obtained through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals as provided in this Zoning Code.
      (2)   A vacant non-conforming lot in the Commercial and Office Building
Districts may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is
located when the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district
in which it is located, including the maximum lot coverage and minimum setback
requirements, except for the minimum lot area and lot width requirements. No
use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for
a particular district shall be permitted on a non-conforming lot. Review and
approval of development on such lots of record shall be conducted according to
the development plan review requirements set forth in
Chapter 1258, Administrative Procedures.
   (c)   Lots in Combination. If a vacant non-conforming lot in any district
adjoins one or more lots in common ownership on the effective date of this
Zoning Code, or applicable amendment thereto, such lots shall be joined to
create conforming lots as a prerequisite for development.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.06   NON-CONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building, structure, or use existing lawfully at the time of this Zoning
Code, or an amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not
comply with the off-street parking regulations for the use may continue without
such parking facilities. In the event an existing building is altered or a use
is changed or substituted, in accordance with these regulations, then
additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided in compliance with
Section
1274.07, Non-conforming Site Conditions Existing at the Time of Development
Plan Review, if this Code requires such additional parking spaces as a result
of the proposed changes.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.07   NON-CONFORMING SITE CONDITIONS EXISTING AT TIME OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN
REVIEW.
   If a non-conforming site condition(s) exists when a revised development plan
is required pursuant to
Chapter 1258, Administrative Procedures, then such site condition(s) must be
brought into compliance with district regulations, unless the Planning
Commission determines that such conformance cannot be reasonably achieved
because of existing site conditions. In such case, the Planning Commission
shall approve a development plan that reduces the existing non-conforming site
condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.08   EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the
district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a
conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such
use, site development conditions or signs, or change in operations shall only
be permitted upon review and approval by the Planning Commission according to
the procedures for conditional uses set forth in Section
1258.07, Conditional Zoning Certificate.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.09   DETERMINATION OF NON-CONFORMING STATUS.
   At the time of application for a zoning permit or request for variance, or
upon the request of the Zoning Administrator regarding a non-conforming lot,
building, structure, site condition, or use, the property owner shall submit
sufficient evidence to verify that such lot, building, structure, site
condition, or use was lawfully created or established in accordance with the
zoning regulations in existence at that time. If the evidence submitted
indicates the lot, building, structure, site condition, or use was legally
established and has since become non-conforming because of the establishment of
or amendment to this Zoning Code, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a
certificate of non-conforming use. This certificate shall specify the reason
why the use, building, structure, site condition, or lot is non-conforming, and
for non-conforming uses shall also include a description of the extent and kind
of use made of the property in question, the portion of the structure or land
used for the non-conforming use, and the extent that dimensional or other
requirements are non-conforming.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1274.10   COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING PERMIT.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and use of buildings for which a zoning permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, or amendments thereto,
provided that construction is carried on diligently and without interruption
and the entire building is completed within two years after the issuance of the
zoning permit. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction.

of electricity for use on the subject site. These regulations are established
to ensure that WECS will be developed and maintained in a manner that maximizes
utilization of Walton Hills' wind energy resources and to balance the need for
clean, renewable energy while protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 2011-15. Passed 7-19-11.)
1276.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
in this section.
   (a)   "Monopole tower" means a tower constructed of a single, self-
supporting metal tube, anchored to a foundation.
   (b)   "Owner" means the individual property owner that intends to own and
operate the WECS in accordance with this chapter.
   (c)   "Rotor" means the non-stationary part of a wind turbine.
   (d)   "Rotor radius" means the distance between the center point of the
rotor and the outermost point on the rotor or blade.
   (e)   "Turbine height" means the distance between the ground elevation at
the base of the structure and the uppermost point of the rotor/blade/structure
and/or revolution.
   (f)   "Wind energy conversion system – private use" means a WECS which
consists of a wind turbine, tower, and associated control or conversion
electronics for the purpose of providing electrical power to a lawful principle
use. A system having a rated capacity of ten kilowatts (kW) or less for
residential use or 100kW or less for non-residential uses shall be considered a
private system for the purposes of these regulations.

   (a)   Zoning Districts.
      (1)   Rooftop-mounted WECS may be located in Industrial and Commercial
Zoning Districts as an accessory use subject to the restrictions and
requirements of this chapter.
 
Acreage Required Maximum Height Side Yard Required Zoning District
2 ½ or greater  70 feet        75 feet            I-1
2 ½ or greater  34 feet        50 feet            B
2 ½ or greater  34 feet        30 feet            R-R
 
      (2)   Ground-mounted WECS may be located in Industrial and Commercial
Zoning Districts as an accessory use subject to the following restrictions and
requirements of this chapter:
 
Acreage Required   Maximum Height Side Yard Required
2 ½ - 4.99 acres  80 feet        1.1 times total height of WECS
5 acres or greater 120 feet       1.1 times total height of WECS
 
   (b)   Setbacks for Ground-Mounted WECS.
      (1)   General. A ground-mounted WECS shall be set back from all property
lines, street right-of-way lines, and overhead utility lines a minimum distance
equal to 1.1 times the total height of the WECS. Setbacks shall be measured
from the center of the wind turbine base. With respect to an overhead utility
line that provides service only to a single building or a single parcel of
land, the setback requirements shall be met if the turbine is placed so that no
portion of a rotor blade extends closer than ten feet to the utility line.
      (2)   Residential.
         A.   In the case of a tilt-down WECS that does not exceed thirty-four
feet in height and is located in a Residential District, the WECS shall be set
back equal to 1.1 times the total height of the WECS. If the tower is a tilt-
down and or crank-up monopole design, the pole must pull down or retract
towards the installation site and away from all adjoining properties. If guy
wires are utilized as part of the tower design, then the guy wire anchors shall
be placed at least fifteen feet from any abutting property boundaries.
         B.   All WECS shall be located in the rear yard portion of any lot. An
exception is when a WECS is a rooftop-mounted system.
         C.   No part of a WECS shall be located within or over drainage,
utility or other established easements, or on or over property lines.
   (c)   Height. The height of a ground-mounted WECS shall be limited by the
setback requirements of this section. The height of a rooftop or other
building-mounted WECS shall not exceed the maximum permitted building height
for the property by more than twenty percent. For a rooftop or other building-
mounted WECS that exceeds the maximum permitted building height by more than
twenty percent, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals after a public hearing
may approve a greater height if the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
determines that the placement of the WECS and context of the WECS site will
mitigate any significant negative visual or safety impacts on nearby
properties.
   (d)   Number of Units. Each structure or parcel shall be limited to the
construction of one WECS unit.
(Ord. 2011-15. Passed 7-19-11.)
1276.04   LIGHTING, DESIGN AND NOISE.
   (a)   Lighting. WECS shall not be illuminated except as required by the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   (b)   Structural Design. WECS shall be designed to meet all requirements of
the Village Building Code and all applicable State and Federal regulations.
   (c)   Aesthetic Design. WECS shall be designed in a manner that makes them
as visually unobtrusive as possible, while meeting safety requirements. To this
end, towers shall be monopole. With respect to color, WECS shall be white or
off-white or unpainted metal, unless other colors are required by Federal
regulations or unless another color is approved by the Planning Commission as
being more effective or more appropriate in a particular instance.
   (d)   Signs. All installations will have a durable permanent sign warning of
electric shock and identifying the manufacturer and installer with contact
information for both but shall not include any off-premise advertising or any
advertising for businesses or other activities located on the premises. The
total area of such signs shall not exceed two square feet nor exceed a height
of five feet.
   (e)   Noise. All WECS shall comply with the noise requirements in this
section. These levels may not be exceeded at any time, including short-term
events such as utility outages and severe wind storms. A manufacturer's sound
report shall be required with a building permit application.
      (1)   No WECS located on a residential parcel shall create noise that
exceeds a maximum of thirty-five decibels at any property line on which the
WECS is located. WECS located in districts other than residential shall not
create noise that exceeds a maximum of fifty-five decibels at any property line
on which the WECS is located. Measurement of sound levels shall not be adjusted
for, or averaged with, non-operating periods. Any WECS(s) exceeding these
levels shall immediately cease operation upon notification by the Village and
may not resume operation until the noise levels have been reduced, verified and
approved by the Zoning Inspector. WECS unable to comply with these noise
restrictions shall be shut down immediately and removed upon notification by
the Zoning Inspector.
   (f)   Climability. The base of the tower shall be designed so it is not
climbable for a distance of twelve feet, as measured from the ground.
   (g)   Electrical Components. All electrical components of the WECS shall
conform to relevant and applicable local, State and national codes, and
relevant and applicable international standards. All electrical wires
associated with a WECS, other than wires necessary to connect the wind
generator to the tower wiring shall be located underground.
   (h)   Electrical Interference. No WECS shall be installed in any location
where its proximity with existing fixed broadcast, retransmission, or reception
antenna for radio, television, or wireless phone or other personal
communication systems would produce electromagnetic interference with signal
transmission or reception.
   (i)   Rotor Safety. Each WECS shall be equipped with both manual and
automatic controls to limit the rotational speed of the blade within the design
limits of the rotor. An external, manual shut-off switch shall be included with
the installation. The minimum distance between the ground and any protruding
blades utilized on a ground mounted WECS shall be fifteen feet as measured at
the lowest point of the arc of the blades.

1284.01   INTENT.  
   It is the intent of the Legislative Authority to preserve the woodland
nature of the Village, stabilize sloped grades, reduce surface runoff, erosion
and downstream flooding, retain areas of rainfall percolation into the water
table, ameliorate climatic and weather extremes, support wildlife and preserve
the vegetational aesthetics for which the Village is known. To this end, the
Legislative Authority proposes, when development requires the removal or
reduction of trees and vegetation, to reduce the number of potentially
hazardous or otherwise undesirable trees and vegetation, to select more
beneficial trees and vegetation as opposed to less beneficial, and to promote a
mixture of ages and species of vegetation where it naturally may occur. It is
not the intent of the Legislative Authority to restrict or hinder acceptable
development within the Village, but only to establish guidelines for
development compatible with long-term preservation of the woodland environment.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1284.02   TIMBERING OR COMMERCIAL CUTTING DEFINED.
   As used in this chapter, "timbering or commercial cutting" means the cutting
of trees having a trunk diameter of not less than nine inches at a distance of
fourteen inches above ground level.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1284.03   PERMIT REQUIRED.

any piece or parcel of land located within the Village unless a permit
therefore shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator or his or her
assistant.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1284.04   CLEAR-CUTTING.
   Clear-cutting is prohibited, except to the extent necessary to clear a
building site, yard, driveway and right-of-way providing access to the site
from a dedicated public highway, after a permit therefore has been issued by
the Zoning Administrator.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1284.05   SELECTIVE CUTTING.
   Selective or sanitary cutting of timber shall be permitted under the
following conditions, upon application to the Zoning Administrator:

owner or his or her representative, shall, together, inspect the wooded area to
be selectively cut, to butt brand and paint stripe the specific trees to be

cutting of an unmarked tree shall constitute a separate violation of this
chapter and shall constitute grounds for the immediate revocation of the
permit.

without a new permit.
   (d)   Dead and diseased trees, and damaged trees which threaten life or

such premises which will adequately describe such premises so that they may be
located on the plat map of the Village.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1284.07   CONDITIONS OF PERMIT; BOND.
   The conditions under which permits shall be issued under this chapter are as
follows:
   (a)   A permit for the cutting of trees shall not be issued by the Zoning
Administrator in any case where such cutting of trees would result in
interference with the natural water supply of the Village or any of the lots or
lands therein, or if it would result in the undue erosion of the soil on such
lots or lands.
   (b)   A permit for the cutting of trees shall not be issued by the Zoning
Administrator unless and until adequate assurance is furnished by the applicant
that if such permit is granted and such cutting of trees is done, all of the
cordwood, branches, brush, rubble and refuse resulting therefrom will be
removed from the premises or cut up, chipped and placed on the forest floor in
such a way that no fire hazard shall result therefrom.
   (c)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to require that the applicant
file with the Village a bond, the penal sum of which shall be in an amount
which the Zoning Administrator reasonably estimates will be sufficient to pay
the cost and expense of the clean-up operation.

   (b)   Within an area occupied by access roads, parking areas, accessory
buildings, sidewalks, utility installations and similar necessary development
(subject to Village approval of the location of said improvements).
   (c)   Open areas not exceeding fifty percent of the lot (e.g. a meadow or

1288.01   FINDINGS.
   Based on evidence submitted to the Legislative Authority and the Planning
Commission concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses including: the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton
v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991) and
including the studies conducted by other cities including, but not limited to,
those conducted by New York City, New York; Kansas City, Missouri; Denver,
Colorado; Newport News, Virginia and Phoenix, Arizona, the Village hereby finds
that substantial sufficient evidence exists concerning the negative "secondary
effects" that sexually oriented business uses have on the communities in which
they locate so as to warrant the adoption of sexually oriented business zoning
regulations.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1288.02   PURPOSE.
   (a)   For the purpose of protecting the public health, safety and welfare,
and in order to minimize the negative "secondary effects" known by the Village
to be associated with sexually oriented businesses (see Section
1288.08, Definitions,) such as the spread of communicable diseases; reduction
in property values; diminishing of the character and quality of residential
neighborhoods; increase in crime; denigration of social and moral order; and
the diminishing or destroying the use of public facilities, particularly those
facilities used by children or those used for religious purposes, the Village
has adopted sexually oriented business regulations.
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any constitutionally
protected communicative materials or communication, including that associated
with sexually oriented businesses. Furthermore it is not the intent of this
chapter to deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
   (c)   Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

1289.01   PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level
of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Village of Walton Hills.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage-
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in this Section
1289.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Walton Hills shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter 1290, Erosion and Sediment Control.

      (2)   Practices designed for final use. Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots. Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in
Chapter 1240, shall provide storm water management and water quality controls
for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for
lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year,
24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development
runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources. Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other applicable
Federal, State, and local agencies as required in Section
1289.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1290 and
Chapter 1291, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels. All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1289.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance. All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the Village Engineer as detailed in Section
1289.08.
      (8)   Ownership. Unless otherwise required by the Village, storm water
management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a
separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if
compensated by the property owners, by the Village. Storm water management
practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
      (10)   Preservation of wetland hydrology. Concentrated storm water runoff
from BMPs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
         If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be preformed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre- development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria. All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure. The Village Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, and other applicable Federal, State, and local agencies as
required in Section
1289.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1290 and
Chapter 1291, all as determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream
relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the
vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges. Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this in not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels. Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems. Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25% of the
cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts and pipe arches
must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation. In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. First consideration
for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control. The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCM's that meet or exceed the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control. The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management practices are
designed to meet the following requirements for storm water quantity control
for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the Village
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the development drainage area before and after development. These
calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use.
            4.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section 1289.09(d)(3)A., determine
the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the
percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table 1.
Table 1: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff
is:                                               The critical storm will be:
Equal to or greater than: And less than:
Table 1: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff
is:                                               The critical storm will be:
Equal to or greater than: And less than:
----                      10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas. CM's on
previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the Construction General
Permit.

1289.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the Village of Walton Hills determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of water quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the onsite controls required under this regulation. The Village
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed.

   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all storm water management practices shall be
no less than 25 feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire
practice plus an additional 25-foot-wide band around the perimeter of the storm
water management practice.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural storm water management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the Village.
Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be
removed by the Village at the property owners' expense.

1289.12   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent storm water
management practices must be installed and made functional, as determined by
the Village Engineer and per the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan.
   (b)   An as-built certification, including a survey and inspection, must be
sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer and a professional surveyor
with a statement certifying that the storm water management practices, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan approved by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
storm water practice calculations if he or she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan. The as-built survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of
such practices and include the entity responsible for long- term maintenance as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement as specified in Section
1289.08 must be provided to the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10; Ord. 2013-24. Passed 12-17-13.)
1289.13   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The Village shall inspect storm water management practices periodically.
Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the Village shall
provide written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the
Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon
notification, the responsible party shall have five working days, or other
mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a plan with detailed
action items and established timelines. Should repairs not be made within this
time, or a plan approved by the Village Engineer for these repairs not be in
place, the Village may undertake the necessary repairs and assess the
responsible party.
(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10; Ord. 2013-24. Passed 12-17-13.)
1289.14   FEES.
   The Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village before the review process begins. The Village Engineer shall establish
a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing these
services.
(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10; Ord. 2013-24. Passed 12-17-13.)
1289.15   BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village Finance
Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The storm water bond will be returned, less Village administrative
fees, when the following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three years from the time
of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An as built inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners association
who will take long- term responsibility for these BMPs, is accepted by the
Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
storm water management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.

1289.16   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.

1291.01   PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the Village of Walton Hills contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Village. The
specific purpose and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses and
developments within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian
areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, stream bank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the Village by minimizing encroachment on watercourse
channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as gabion baskets
and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the
safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to the scenic beauty and
environment of the Village, and thereby preserving the character of the
Village, the quality of life of the residents of the Village, and corresponding
property values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect and enhance these
functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a riparian setback along designated watercourses in
the Village.
(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10.)
1291.02   APPLICABILITY, COMPLIANCE AND VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   This regulation shall apply to all zoning districts.
   (b)   This regulation shall apply to all structures and uses on lands

(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10.)
1291.10   VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may grant a variance to this regulation as
provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Planning Commission shall consider the potential
harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a proposed
structure or use.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may nol authorize any structure or use in a
Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   Variances shall be void if not implemented within one year of the
date of issuance.
   (b)   In making a determination under division (a) of this section, the
Planning Commission may consider the following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
Chapter 1468, Flood Damage Reduction, may be used as guidance when granting
variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or
use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include best management practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the Village. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian setback. Variance may be granted for gravel driveways when
necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
Village, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning Commission may consider granting variations to other
area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Planning Commission,
for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate to
maintain the purposes of this regulation.
(Ord. 2010-34. Passed 12-14-10.)

reasons, the following:
   (a)   To relieve congestion so streets can be utilized more fully for
movement of vehicular traffic;
   (b)   To promote the safety and convenience of pedestrians and shoppers by
separating parking areas and extensive car movements in the vicinity of
pedestrian ways;
   (c)   To protect adjoining residential neighborhoods from on-street parking;
   (d)   To promote the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of

off-street parking facilities;
   (e)   To provide regulations and standards for the development of accessory
off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance with objectives of the

land uses.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1292.02   PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be provided prior to the occupancy of a building or use. Facilities shall be
provided for the entire building or use in accordance with the regulations
contained in this chapter whenever:
   (a)   A building is constructed or a new use is established.
   (b)   The use of an existing building is changed to a use requiring more
off-street parking facilities.
   (c)   An existing building is altered and there is an increase in seating
capacity, floor area of the building, or number of employees.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1292.03   UNITS OF MEASURE.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Zoning Code, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used, unless
specifically noted otherwise.
   (b)   Seats. Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking
spaces, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units installed or
indicated, or one seat for each twenty-four lineal inches of benches or pews.
When fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity shall be determined as being
one seat for each twenty square feet of floor area of the assembly room.
   (c)   Employees. Where employees are the standard for determining parking
space requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on the
shift with the highest number of employees expected.
   (d)   Fractional Numbers. Where the computation results in a fractional
unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
   (e)   Parking for Mixed Uses. Where a building or group of buildings
contains two or more uses, normally operating during the same hours, the number
of parking spaces for each use shall be computed separately and the total
spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the spaces required for each
use, except as otherwise provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1292.04   OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   The number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use shall
be determined by application of the standards set forth in Schedule 1292.04.
For a use not specified in this Schedule, the Planning Commission shall apply
the standard for a specified use that the Commission determines to be most
similar to the proposed use.

1292.05   LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
the location of off-street parking facilities shall further be regulated
according to the following provisions:
   (a)   All Districts. All required off-street parking spaces shall be located
on the same lot as the use served, unless otherwise provided for in this
chapter. If the parking spaces required in Schedule 1292.04 cannot reasonably
be provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the
Planning Commission may permit such spaces to be provided on other off-street
property, provided that such spaces shall be within four hundred feet walking
distance, measured along the route of public access to the property, of a
public entrance to such principal use and use of such off-street parking spaces
are secured either by common ownership, leased for at least twenty years, or
through a permanent easement. The Zoning Administrator and the Law Solicitor
shall approve such lease or easement.
   (b)   Access. All required off-street parking spaces shall have direct
access to an aisle or driveway without the need to move any other vehicle,
except as otherwise specifically permitted in this chapter.
   (c)   Parking in Designated Areas Only. Any vehicle customarily or
seasonally parked on any lot shall be so parked only in parking areas
specifically constructed for such purposes, and shall not be parked on tree
lawns, sidewalks, other lawns, or areas required by this Code to be landscaped.
   (d)   Areas Computed as Parking Spaces. Areas that may be computed as open
or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private garage, carport or
other area available for parking, other than a street or driveway.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1292.06   REDUCTION IN REQUIRED PARKING.
   A reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces is permitted
in compliance with the following:
   (a)   Allowance For Shared Parking.
      (1)   Parking spaces that are designed and developed to comply with the
requirements for one building or use shall not be counted as fulfilling the
parking requirement of another building or use except as specifically permitted
in this section. The Planning Commission may approve a development plan with a
reduction in the number of parking spaces required if it can be shown that the
lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent with these regulations
and when it is determined that in a project with more than one use or a single-
use project for which the different components of the use have varying peak
demands, the uses can be adequately accommodated with a lesser number of
parking spaces than that which is required based on the sum of the various uses
computed separately.
      (2)   The required parking spaces for a proposed use can be accommodated
on an adjacent or nearby site within four hundred feet walking distance,
provided that binding, recorded agreements are made between the business owners
and property owners of uses that are not normally open, used or operated during
the same hours to ensure the perpetual joint use and maintenance of such shared
parking areas and the continuance of such upon transfer of ownership. The
binding agreement shall specify the parking spaces that shall be shared. In
such case, not more than fifty percent of the required parking spaces shall be
shared.
   (b)   Deferred Construction Of Required Spaces. If the number of parking
spaces required in Schedule 1292.04 is substantially larger than the number
anticipated by the applicant and the applicant provides sufficient evidence
that supports the reduced parking needs, a development plan may be approved
with an allowance for the construction of a lesser number of parking spaces
provided that:
      (1)   The total number of spaces initially constructed shall not be less
than seventy percent of the spaces required by Schedule 1292.04, Required Off-
street Parking Spaces.
      (2)   Suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the balance
of the total number of spaces otherwise required by Schedule 1292.04. Such
suitable areas shall be illustrated on the development plan in locations and
with landscaping in full compliance with this Zoning Code. Such areas shall not
be counted towards any open space requirement set forth in this Zoning Code.
      (3)   The Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project's parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the parking spaces identified
in subsection (b) be constructed.

exclusive of access drives and parking aisles and shall not interfere with
parking or circulation.
   (e)   Reduction in Required Waiting Spaces. The Planning Commission may
reduce the number of required waiting spaces when the applicant provides
credible documentation, such as studies from similar sites, that fewer than the
required number of waiting spaces does not impede vehicular traffic flow on and
off the site as well as ingress/egress to the site.

shall be encouraged to reduce the number of such highway access points.
   (c)   Width of Access Drives. The width of such entrance and exit lanes
shall be not less than nine feet or more than twelve feet per lane and shall
not exceed a total of thirty-six feet.
   (d)   Radius. The radius of the edge of the access drive apron shall be at
least thirty feet so that a vehicle may enter from or exit onto the curb lane

its use for parking purposes. In the event of a discrepancy between the need to
perform asphalt spot repairs or complete parking lot resurfacing, the
determination shall be made by the Village Engineer. The need to perform
asphalt spot repairs or complete parking lot resurfacing and the type of
material used, shall be determined by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Storage. All off-street parking areas for nonresidential uses shall
not be used for the continuous storage of a vehicle for more than forty-eight
hours, except where expressly permitted in this Zoning Code, as accessory to
the principal use of the lot.

CHAPTER 1294
Conditional Use Regulations
1294.01   Purpose.
1294.02   General criteria for all conditional uses.
1294.03   Specific conditions for conditional uses.
1294.04   Conditional uses in the Country Home District.
1294.05   Conditional uses in the Commercial or Office Building Districts.
1294.06   Conditional uses in the Industrial Districts.
1294.061   Conditional uses in the Mixed-Use Development District.
1294.07   Supplemental regulations for certain uses.
1294.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   Conditional uses are a classification of uses that are determined to
generally be compatible in the district in which they are listed as a
conditional use. However, this category of uses is so classified because of the
need to adequately monitor the proposed use in order to ensure that the use and
its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific location in
which the use is proposed. Such monitoring is necessary because the external
impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or indeterminable in
advance, making it possible that, without the Planning Commission's review, a
particular use could be inappropriate in certain locations within the district.
   (b)   These regulations are intended to ensure that conditional uses are
reviewed in a reasonable and equitable manner, while safeguarding the property
rights of all individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the
community. Toward these ends, it is recognized that this Zoning Code should
provide for more detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in
a specific district with respect to such considerations as location, design,
size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, requirements for public
facilities, and traffic generation. In considering a proposed conditional use,
the Planning Commission may assign reasonable requirements to ensure that the
proposed development is appropriate in the location in which it is proposed.
Accordingly, conditional use applications shall conform to the procedures and
requirements of
Chapter 1258, Administrative Procedures.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1294.02   GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria,
which are in addition to specific conditions, standards and regulations set
forth in Sections
1294.03 through
1294.07. The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria and shall
find adequate evidence that:
   (a)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate with the prevailing existing
or intended character of the general vicinity.
   (b)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the conditional use
will not endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare.
   (c)   The establishment will not restrict or adversely affect the existing
use of the adjacent property owners.
   (d)   The establishment of the conditional use, in the proposed location,
will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
   (e)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional use
that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by
right that may be incompatible.
   (f)   The establishment of the conditional use, in the proposed location,
will promote the economic viability of the community.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009; Ord. 2014-12. Passed 1-20-15.)
1294.03   SPECIFIC CONDITIONS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the general criteria established in Section
1294.02, the following specific conditions shall apply.
   (a)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. Nothing in these regulations
shall prohibit the Planning Commission from prescribing reasonable
supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition to the requirements in this
chapter in order to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth in Section
1294.02.
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations. A conditional use shall conform
to the regulations of the district in which it is located and to other
requirements of this Zoning Code, as well as satisfy the conditions, standards,
and requirements of this chapter. Whenever there is a difference between the
provisions of the conditional use regulations and the district regulations, the
provisions of this chapter shall prevail, unless clearly indicated differently
in the regulations.
   (c)   Overall Development Standards.
      (1)   No lighting shall constitute a nuisance and in no way shall impair
safe movement of traffic on any street or highway. All outside lighting shall
comply with the lighting requirements set forth in
Chapter 1298, Landscaping, Screening, and Outdoor Lighting Regulations.
      (2)   Floodlights, loudspeakers or similar devices shall not be
constructed or used in any manner that will cause hazards or annoyance to the
public generally or to the occupants of adjacent property.
      (3)   Landscaping and buffering shall be provided in compliance with
Chapter 1298, Landscaping, Screening, and Outdoor Lighting Regulations.
      (4)   The proposed use shall not generate excessive noise, odor, dust, or
smoke beyond the premises. In order to minimize any effects of the above, the
Planning Commission may require all applicable surface areas to be paved, and
impose additional noise reduction measures, including mounding, landscaping and
sound barriers, to ensure that the level of noise is less than or the same as
the prevailing noise levels of permitted uses in the district in which the
conditional use is proposed.
      (5)   The conditional use will be designed and constructed so that all
access drives, access points to public streets, driveways, parking and service
areas shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in Section
1292.09, Regulations for Access Drives.
      (6)   In the Country Home District, on lots of one acre or more, all
points of entrance or exit should be no closer than seventy-five feet from an
intersection.

1296.03   APPLICATION OF SIGN REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to signs outside
of the public right-of-way, except when specifically stated otherwise.
   (b)   A sign shall only be erected, established, painted, created, or
maintained in Walton Hills in conformance with the standards, procedures,
exemptions and other requirements of this chapter. Where a change is made to
the sign other than routine maintenance, the sign and its structure shall
conform to the regulations in this chapter, as provided for in subsection
1296.10 (d), Termination.
   (c)   Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of
a freestanding structure are not considered signs and are thus exempt from
these regulations. Architectural features include any construction attending
to, but not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscape or
building or structural forms that enhance the site in general.
   (d)   The following signs and displays are exempt from the regulations of
this chapter:
      (1)   Public regulation and information signs;
      (2)   Building marker;
      (3)   Flags of any nation or government;
      (4)   Any sign inside a building that is not attached to the window or
door and is not legible from a distance of more than three feet beyond the lot
on which the sign is located;
      (5)   Any work of art that does not display a commercial message;
      (6)   Any religious symbol that does not display a commercial message;
      (7)   Any traffic-control sign, such as "STOP" or "YIELD", located on
private property that meets applicable governmental standards pertaining to
such signs and does not display a commercial message.
      (8)   Signs integral to and not extending beyond the structural edges of
a vending machine, fuel pump, etc.;
      (9)   Holiday decorations displayed for reasonable and customary
durations of time; and,
      (10)   Instructional signs provided such signs comply with the following:
         A.   Instructional signs shall be clearly intended, designed and
located for instructional purposes, as determined by the Zoning Administrator;
         B.   Each sign shall not be larger than necessary to serve the
intended instructional purpose;
         C.   The sign is not in a location and does not possess design
characteristics that constitute or serve the purposes of an identification
sign; and,
         D.   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed sign(s)
does not serve instructional purposes, it shall be considered a freestanding or
wall sign, as applicable, and subject to the pertinent regulations in this
chapter.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1296.04   COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area, and building frontage:
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the frame and structural support, except as
provided for in subsection
1296.04(a)(4) B.
      (2)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign
shall be the area of not more than three geometric shapes that encompasses the
entire area of the sign including the background or frame.
      (3)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on
a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregular shaped
freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than
three regular geometric shapes that encompass the perimeter of all the elements
in the display.
         A.   When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but
the elements are separated by open space, the area of the sign shall include
all the display areas, including the space between the elements.
         B.   Up to five percent of the permitted sign area may be considered
minor protrusions, and extend outside of the maximum limitation of three
geometric shapes and are, therefore, exempted from being included as part of
the sign area. See Figure 1, Calculation of Open Space and Area of Minor
Protrusion.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3841.jpg]
 
      (4)   For freestanding signs and projecting signs.
         A.   The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces when two identical display faces are joined, are parallel, or within
thirty degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point separated by
a distance that exceeds three feet apart. For any sign that has two display
surfaces that do not comply with the above regulation or has more than two
display surfaces, then each surface shall be included when determining the area
of the sign.
         B.   For freestanding signs, the portion of a solid sign base up to a
maximum height of four feet, shall not be calculated as sign area.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
measured from the base of the sign at its point of attachment to the ground to
its topmost element. However, if the support of a freestanding sign is placed
on a graded earth mound or located at an elevation different from the nearest
public street, the sign height shall be measured from the surrounding natural
grade, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
these sign regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public
street, that faces a public parking lot, or that contains a public entrance to
the uses therein shall be considered the building frontage. Each building
frontage shall be entitled to the sign area permitted in this chapter.
      (1)   The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
      (4)   The primary frontage shall be defined as the portion of a frontage
that serves as the main access point to a building or building unit, except as
provided for in subsection
1296.04(c)(5). A site/building will be considered to have secondary frontage
when any of the following site/building characteristics are present: (See
Figure 2, Illustration of Primary and Secondary Frontage.)
         A.   The subject site is a corner lot;
         B.   The primary parking area is not located adjacent to a public
street; and,
         C.   The building or unit has walls with ingress and egress that do
not face the public street.
      (5)   When a site has primary and secondary frontage, as defined in
subsection 1296.04 (c)(4), the property owner shall determine which wall shall
be the primary building frontage and which wall(s) shall be the secondary
building frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be considered
its primary frontage. Any business, business unit, and/or building shall be
limited to two secondary frontages.

   (d)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than fifteen feet in height above grade.

(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1296.08 DESIGN STANDARDS.  
   In order to facilitate information legibility, traffic safety and general
economic vitality, signs should be designed in a manner compatible with the
character and style of the buildings on which they are located, and with
adjoining buildings and neighboring signs, in terms of color, materials and
size. Furthermore, signs shall be designed to be structurally sound and located
so as to pose no hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic. More specifically,
signs shall be designed in accordance with the standards in this section. In
addition to ensuring compliance with the numerical standards of these
regulations, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the proposed general
design arrangement and placement of the sign according to the following
criteria:
   (a)   The lettering on a sign shall be large enough to be easily read but
not overly large or out of scale with the building upon which it is placed or
the site. An excessive amount of information on signs, where visual clutter
could create a potential safety hazard to motorists or pedestrians, should be
avoided.
   (b)   The sign should be consolidated into a minimum number of elements.
   (c)   The ratio between the message and the background shall permit easy
recognition of the message.
   (d)   The size, style, and location of the sign shall be appropriate to the
activity of the site.
   (e)   The sign shall complement the building and adjacent buildings by being
designed and placed to enhance the architecture of the building.
   (f)   Signs shall be designed with a limited number of, and harmonious use
of, colors.
   (g)   Continuity. Signs and their location should be considered in
relationship to their surrounding environment. Signs, if seen in series, shall
have a continuity of design with the style of sign generally consistent
throughout the building or block face.
   (h)   Placement. Wall signs shall fit within any given frame of the
architectural design intended for signage. Such signs shall not extend over the
edge of the original sign panel space.
   (i)   Materials. Signs shall be fabricated on and of materials which are of
good quality, good durability and complementary to the building of which they
become part. Outdoor signs and display structures, including the supporting
structure and all parts, shall be of noncombustible material when required by
the Building and Housing Code. However, wood, approved plastic, or other
material not more combustible than wood or approved plastic, may be permitted
by the Zoning Administrator, for small ornamental moldings, cappings, nailing
strips, individual letters, symbols, figures and insignia.
   (j)   Instructional signs shall contain the minimum information and the
minimum area necessary to convey the message and instruct the viewer in the
safe and efficient use of the facility.
   (k)   Sign Concept Plan. For multi-tenant buildings and development projects
with multiple buildings, the Planning Commission may approve basic sign
parameters that set forth the location, size, color, and style of each tenant
sign. Such sign parameters will be established when the Planning Commission
reviews development plans for new buildings. Whenever the Planning Commission
has approved such sign parameters, the Zoning Administrator will ensure any
subsequent sign application submitted for a tenant of the development or
building complies with such sign parameters.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1296.09   SIGN ILLUMINATION, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   The Zoning Administrator shall consider the proposed sign according to the
following standards:
   (a)   Illumination. Signs shall be permitted to be illuminated in compliance
with the following:
      (1)   Light sources shall be shielded from all adjacent buildings and
streets.
      (2)   Lights shall not be of such brightness so as to cause glare that is
hazardous to pedestrians or motorists, or cause reasonable objection from the
adjacent Country Home District.
      (3)   Signs shall not include flashing, moving, or intermittent lighting
in which any part of the message changes at a rate of more than once every ten
seconds.
      (4)   The illumination of signs shall not obstruct traffic control or any
other public informational signs. Signs visible from sight lines along streets
shall not contain symbols or words, or red and green lights that resemble
highway traffic signs or devices.
   (b)   Construction Standards.
      (1)   Structural Design. The construction, erection, safety and
maintenance of all signs shall be in accordance with the Building and Housing

      (7)   No sign shall be attached to a utility pole, tree, trash
receptacle, bench or other structure not intended or approved as a sign
support.
      (8)   Temporary signs shall be durable and weather-resistant, and
fastened or anchored sufficiently, whether attached to the building or
positioned in the ground.
      (9)   No sign regulated by any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
erected in the right-of-way, in proximity to railroad crossings, or at the
intersection of any streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear
vision, or at any location where, by reason of the position, shape or color, it
may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal or device, or which makes use of the words "STOP", "LOOK",
"DANGER" or any other word, phrase, symbol or character in such a manner as to
interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
      (10)   In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this
Section and the provisions of any applicable building codes, the provisions of
the applicable building code shall govern.
   (c)   Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   The property owner, occupant, or other person responsible for the
sign shall maintain the sign in a condition fit for the intended use and he or
she shall have a continuing obligation to comply with all building code
requirements.
      (2)   If the Zoning Administrator finds that any sign is unsafe,
insecure, a menace to the public, or constructed, erected, or maintained in
violation of the provisions of this Zoning Code, notice shall be given in
writing by the Zoning Administrator to the owner. The owner of the sign shall,
within forty-eight hours of such notification, correct such unsafe condition or
remove the sign. If the correction has not been made within the allotted forty-
eight hours, the sign may be removed or altered by the Village to comply with
these regulations at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property upon
which the sign is located. The Zoning Administrator may cause any sign, which,
in the Village opinion, creates a danger to persons or property to be removed
immediately and without notice at the expense of the owner or occupant of the
property upon which the sign is located.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may order any sign to be painted or
refurbished whenever needed to keep the sign in a neat and safe condition. All
supporters, guys, braces and anchors for such signs shall be maintained in a
safe condition.
      (4)   Abandoned Signs and Failure to Maintain. The face of any permanent
sign which advertises a business that has not been conducted on the premises
for 180 consecutive days, or fails to serve the purposes for which it was
intended, or evidences a lack of maintenance, shall be removed by the owner,
agent, or person having the beneficial use of the building, structure, or land
upon which such sign is located, within ten business days after written notice
by the Zoning Administrator, and the sign area shall be replaced by a neutral,
single background color panel or similar cover. If the sign is comprised of
individually raised letters, the letters shall be removed and any holes in the
building's façade repaired. Upon failure to comply with such notice within the
time specified in such order, the Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized to
cause removal of such sign, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by
the owner of the property on which the sign is located.

(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.05   SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING OF PARKING LOTS.
   (a)   Landscaping on the Interior of Parking Lots. Interior landscaping of
parking lots shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements.
      (1)   For any parking area designed to accommodate twenty or more
vehicles when there are three or more parking aisles, a minimum of five percent
of the parking lot shall be planted as landscaped island areas, developed and
reasonably distributed throughout the parking lot to define major circulation
aisles and driving lanes and provide visual and climatic relief from broad
expanses of pavement.
      (2)   Interior landscaped areas shall be dispersed so as to define aisles
and break up the expanse of paving and limit unbroken rows of parking to a
maximum of one-hundred feet. Each interior landscaped area shall be no less
than 100 square feet. The minimum width for each area shall be ten feet;
      (3)   Within the landscaped islands, there shall be provided one shade
tree for every ten parking spaces. Each landscape island shall have at least
one shade tree.
      (4)   Shrubs or low spreading plant materials shall be planted within the
required landscaped islands in such a way that there is no impairment to the
visibility of motorists or pedestrians.
      (5)   If the specific application of the interior landscape requirements
will seriously limit functions of the building site, the Planning Commission
shall have authority to permit consolidation and relocation of these landscaped
areas on the building site.
      (6)   Landscaped areas along the perimeter of the parking area, or in any
part of a setback or yard, shall not be counted as interior parking lot
landscaped areas; except perimeter plantings may be used to satisfy the
requirements in this section when parking facilities are less than forty-two
feet in width and accommodate twenty or fewer vehicles.
      (7)   For the purpose of this section, the area of a parking lot shall be
the total vehicular surface area within the perimeter of the parking lot,
including the landscaped islands, parking spaces and all circulation aisles
except those with no parking spaces or landscaped islands located on either
side. See Figure 1, Parking Lot Interior Calculation.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3853.jpg]
 
   (b)   Perimeter Landscaping Requirements. In addition to the requirements of
subsections
1298.05(a) and
1298.05(c) hereof, perimeter landscaping shall be required along any side of a
parking lot that abuts adjoining property that is not a right-of-way. A
landscaped strip at least ten feet in width shall be located between the
parking area and the abutting property lines. One large deciduous or two small
deciduous trees for each forty lineal feet shall be planted in the landscaping
strip. However, this does not mean that shade trees must be located forty feet
on center or be spaced forty feet apart. This ten foot wide strip shall be
landscaped open space free of any wall, fence, embankment and/or walkway. Such
wall, fence, etc. may exist or be constructed on the edge of such landscape
strip. The requirements of this section shall not apply where planting is
required for screening pursuant to Section
1298.06, Buffering and Screening Between Districts and Uses.
   (c)   Street Frontage Planting Requirements. In addition to the requirements
of subsections
1298.05(a) and
1298.05(b) hereof, when a parking lot is located adjacent to a public right-of-
way, screening shall be provided to reduce the visual impact of the parking lot
utilizing one of the following methods. The requirements of this subsection
shall not apply where planting is required for screening pursuant to subsection
1298.06(c)(4).
      (1)   Landscaped setbacks. Provide at least a twenty-foot wide landscaped
area exclusive of that required for sidewalks or utility easements, as
specified in the Zoning Code, between the right-of-way and the parking lot, to
be planted with one large deciduous or two small deciduous trees for each forty
lineal feet of frontage. This landscaped strip shall contain at least a three-
foot high evergreen hedge, masonry wall or ornamental fence, such wall, fence,
etc. shall be constructed on the edge of such landscape strip closest to the
parking lot.
      (2)   Grade changes. In cases where substantial grading is necessary that
results in a parking lot lower in elevation than the surrounding or adjacent
right-of-way, the resulting embankment should be planted with low shrubs and
shade or ornamental trees. A minimum of ten feet of landscaping should be
provided between the right-of-way and the parking lot.
      (3)   Landscape berms. Create at least a two-foot high berm, measured
from the natural grade, with slopes not to exceed twenty-five percent for lawn
areas. Berms planted with ground cover and shrubs can be steeper; however, no
slope should exceed forty percent.
      (4)   Woodland preservation. In cases where quality woodland exists,
preserve existing trees between the parking lot and the right-of-way. Provide
additional evergreen shrubs if needed to achieve an effective visual buffer.
The vegetation should be saved.
   (d)   Landscaping Design Criteria.
      (1)   The primary landscaping materials used in parking lots shall be
trees that provide shade or are capable of providing shade at maturity.
Shrubbery, hedges, and other live planting material may be used to complement
the tree planting scheme or landscape design but shall not be the sole
components of the landscaping. Avoid tall shrubs or low branching trees that
will restrict visibility. Effective use of earth berms and existing topography
is also encouraged as a component of the landscape plan.
      (2)   In large parking lots, separate pedestrian walkways should be
provided to allow safe movement within the lots. These walkways should
generally be oriented perpendicular to and between parking bays. Adjacent to
the walks, trees should be planted. These plantings will aid in the
identification of walkway locations within the lot and also aid in providing
shade for the pedestrian. The following guidelines apply to the development of
walkways within large parking lots.
         A.   One walkway can serve as a collector for up to four bays of
parked cars.
         B.   The walkways shall be a minimum of four feet wide, allowing an
additional thirty inches on each side for overhanging of automobiles.
         C.   All walkways shall be raised to a standard sidewalk height and
shall be constructed of different paving material than the parking lot.
   (e)   Accessways. Necessary accessways shall be permitted to traverse the
required landscaping area. The width of such accessways shall not be subtracted
from the linear dimensions used to determine the minimum number of trees
required in this section.
   (f)   Vehicular Encroachment. A vehicle shall not encroach upon any
landscaped area.
   (g)   Vehicular Use Areas. Vehicular use areas, other than parking spaces or
parking lots, for all land uses require two square feet of landscaped area for
each 100 square feet of pavement or fraction thereof.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.06   BUFFERING AND SCREENING BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND USES.
   (a)   Intent. The intent of this section is to establish provisions for a
visual screen or buffer between incompatible uses and to reduce the effects of
glare from automobile headlights, noise, and other objectionable activities
conducted on a given lot.
   (b)   Screening. Screening, as required by the provisions of this Zoning
Code, shall be of such nature and density that will screen the activities on
the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting
lot.
   (c)   When Required. A buffer yard shall be required when:
      (1)   A lot in the Commercial, Office Building and Industrial Districts
abuts the R-1, Country Home district;
      (2)   A lot in the R-1, Country Home District is devoted to a non-
residential conditional use;
      (3)   Required by the Conditional Use Regulations in
Chapter 1294, Conditional Use Regulations;
      (4)   When any wall of a non-residential building in the Commercial,
Office Building, and Industrial Districts is across the street from the R-1,
Country Home District, screening shall be installed along the full length of
such street frontage. No screening shall be required when the Commercial,
Office Building or Industrial Districts lot is used for residential purposes.
   (d)   Width of Buffer Yard. The width of the buffer yard shall be equal to
the most restrictive parking set back set forth in the applicable zoning
district or ten feet, whichever is greater.
   (e)   Location. The buffer yard shall be located entirely within the higher
intensity zoning district or use and abutting the zoning district line or lot
line of lower intensity use. However, the buffer yard may be placed in the
lower intensity zoning district or partially within both zoning districts if
both sides of the zoning district line and the entire buffer yard width are
within common ownership and a permanent easement is provided over any portion
of the buffer yard not within the higher intensity zoning district.
   (f)   Buffer Yard Abutting an Adjacent Jurisdiction. When property lines
abut an adjacent jurisdiction, the Planning Commission shall determine the
specific screening and buffering requirements along that property line after
consideration of the zoning designation and/or land use of the adjacent
property. Requirements shall not exceed those that would be required for
similarly situated/zoned property within the Village of Walton Hills.
   (g)   Screening. When the natural vegetation within the required buffer yard
does not form a solid, continuous, visual screen or does not have a minimum
height of six feet along the entire length of the common boundary at the time
of occupancy, screening shall be installed in compliance with the following:
      (1)   Screening Materials. Screening design and development shall be
compatible with the existing and proposed land use and development character of
the surrounding land, building, and structures. Screening within the buffer
yard shall consist of one or more or combination thereof of the following:
         A.   A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees and/or shrubs of
a variety which shall be equally effective in winter and summer. Trees and/or
shrubs shall be adequately spaced to form a solid, continuous visual screen
within one year after the initial installation. At a minimum, at the time of
planting, the spacing of trees shall not exceed twelve feet on center, and the
planting pattern shall be staggered. Shrubbery shall be more closely spaced.
         B.   Non-living opaque structures such as a solid masonry wall that is
compatible with the principal structure or a solid wood fence together with a
landscaped area at least fifteen feet wide. For solid fences, fences shall be
designed, constructed, and finished so that the supporting members face the
property owner of the fence and they shall be maintained in good condition, be
structurally sound, and attractively finished at all times.
         C.   An ornamental fence with openings through which light and air may
pass together with a landscaped area at least fifteen feet wide. A chain link
fence shall not be permitted.
         D.   A landscaped mound or berm at least ten feet wide, with no more
than a three to one slope.
      (2)   Location. The location of the wall, fence, berm, or vegetation
shall be placed within the buffer yard to maximize the screening effect, as
determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Installation of Screening. Screening shall be continuous and in
place at the time of occupancy. If vehicular or pedestrian access through the
screen is necessary, the screening function shall be preserved.
      (4)   Height of Screening. The height of screening shall be in accordance
with the following:
         A.   Visual screening by walls, fences, or mounds in combination with
vegetation, fences or walls shall be a minimum of six feet high measured from
the natural grade, except as set forth in subsection B. below.
         B.   Whenever the required screening is located within a front yard or
within twenty-five feet of a parking lot, drive, or driveway entrance, the
required screening shall not exceed a height of three feet.
         C.   When used alone, vegetation shall be a minimum of six feet high,
as measured from the natural grade, in order to accomplish the desired
screening effect. The required height shall be achieved no later than one year
after the initial installation.
   (h)   Modifications to Buffering and Screening Requirements. Buffer yards
required by this chapter shall be applied equally to all similarly situated
properties. The Planning Commission is empowered to modify the above buffering
and screening requirements if, and only if:
      (1)   Natural land characteristics such as topography or existing
vegetation on the proposed building site would achieve the same intent as this
section.
      (2)   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the
building site to achieve an equivalent screening and buffering effect.
      (3)   The required screening and landscaping would be ineffective at
maturity due to the proposed topography of the site, and/or the location of the
improvements on the site.
      (4)   The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites is such as to
render required screening ineffective at maturity.
      (5)   A written request is received from the owners of the abutting
residential district property that the screening as required herein should be
waived or varied based on stated purposes.
      (6)   It can be clearly demonstrated that it is highly improbable that
the abutting property will be developed for residential purposes due to
circumstances, which have taken place since the adoption of the Master Plan and
this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.07   SCREENING OF ACCESSORY USES.
   Screening of accessory uses shall be provided according to the following:
   (a)   Trash Collection Areas. Trash collection areas shall comply with the
applicable regulations set forth in
Chapter 1299, General Use Regulations.
   (b)   Ground-mounted Mechanical Equipment. Ground mounted mechanical
equipment shall be screened with evergreen shrubbery so that within one year
the equipment is completely obscured from view.
   (c)   Outdoor Storage and Loading Areas. Permitted accessory loading areas,
outdoor storage of goods, supplies, equipment or fleet vehicles used in the
operation of an establishment, where permitted, shall be enclosed with a solid
fence or wall, including solid gates. The wall or fence shall have a height
tall enough to conceal all operations and materials therein from the view of
any observer standing at the grade level of an abutting lot or a public street.
The applicable zoning district may contain additional regulations governing
outdoor storage.
   (d)   Height of Screening. Screening shall be a minimum of six feet in
height, unless otherwise specified herein, placed adjacent to the waste
receptacles, storage or loading areas so as to effect screening from any
adjacent streets and any adjoining properties.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.08   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS, INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE OF LANDSCAPING.
   Areas within the setback and all other portions of the lot not covered by
permitted structures shall be landscaped with grass, trees, shrubbery and/or
other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material, which at all times
shall be maintained in good and healthy condition.
   (a)   Installation. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter:
      (1)   Each tree at the time of installation shall have a minimum caliper
of two inches and a clear trunk height of at least six feet, unless otherwise
specified.
      (2)   When a small tree is permitted by this chapter, such tree shall
have a minimum caliper of 1.5 inches and a clear trunk height of at least five
feet at the time of installation.
      (3)   If installation of plantings is not completed in a planting season,
then landscaping must be installed during the next planting season.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee. No landscape plan required by this Code shall
be approved and no zoning permit issued until the owner of the lot and/or
building in question has posted a performance guarantee with the Village
conditioned upon satisfactory installation of the approved landscaping in the
owner's landscape plan. Such guarantee shall be in the form of a performance,
surety bond, certified check or any other such type of guarantee approved by
the Village Attorney. The financial guarantee shall cover the estimated cost of
all required landscaping, installation of such landscaping and any other
landscaping obligations on the part of the owner or applicant.
   (c)   Planting Arrangement. Trees and shrubs shall be arranged to create
varied and attractive views and plant material should provide a variety of
color displayed throughout the year.
   (d)   Screening. All screening and buffer yards shall be free of advertising
or other signs, except for directional signs and other signs for the efficient
flow of vehicles.
   (e)   Parking. Vehicle parking shall not be permitted in landscaped areas.
   (f)   Pedestrian Movement. Materials shall not be placed where they will
prevent pedestrian movement unless so planted for that or similar purpose.
   (g)   Maintenance. The owner of landscaping required by this Zoning Code
shall maintain such landscaping in good condition so as to present a healthy,
neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. When necessary, plant
materials shall be replaced, and replacement material shall conform to the
original intent of the landscape plan. No plant material required by this
Zoning Code shall be removed for any reason unless replaced with like kind and
size at the time of removal. If not replaced with like kind and size, a revised
landscape plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for review and
approval.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.09   APPROVAL PROCESS FOR REQUIRED LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   (a)   The location of proposed landscaping, fences or walls required to
fulfill the standards and criteria of this chapter shall be reviewed and
approved as part of a development plan pursuant to
Chapter 1258.
   (b)   However, when a fence, landscaping, or wall is proposed at a separate
time from any other development for new construction, additions or site
renovation, a fence, landscaping, or wall may be approved administratively by
the Zoning Administrator when the Zoning Administrator determines that the
proposal:
      (1)   Complies with the requirements of this chapter;
      (2)   Is consistent with any previously approved plan;
      (3)   Is compatible with the current site development if there is no
approved plan; and
      (4)   Will have a minimal adverse impact to the surrounding areas.
   If, because of the nature and location of the proposed improvements, the
Zoning Administrator does not make such a determination, the request shall be
referred to the Planning Commission and considered by the Commission according
to the development plan procedures in
Chapter 1258.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1298.10   FLEXIBILITY.
   The standards and criteria in this chapter establish the Village's
objectives and levels of landscaping intensity expected. In applying these
standards, the Planning Commission may exercise discretion and flexibility with
respect to the species, placement, and arrangement of the required elements to
ensure that the objectives of this and the proposed development or
redevelopment are best satisfied.

1299.02   FAMILY DAY CARE HOME.
   This Zoning Code recognizes that the availability of safe and affordable,
good-quality child day care is important to the well being of parents and
children. Furthermore, it is the purpose of this section to regulate the
operation of child day care in a manner that preserves the residential
character of neighborhoods. According to Ohio R.C. 5104.054, any type B family
day-care home, whether certified or not certified by the county director of
human services, shall be considered to be a residential use of property for
purposes of municipal, county, and Village zoning and shall be a permitted use
in all zoning districts in which residential uses are permitted. A type "B"
family day-care home is a permanent residence of the provider where childcare
is provided for one to six children and where no more than three children are
under two years of age. For the purposes of this definition, any children under
six years of age who are related to the provider and who are on the premises of
the day-care home shall be counted. Type "B" family day-care homes are a
permitted accessory use in residential districts, and do not require a zoning
permit or a certificate of zoning compliance.

less than the required dimensions shall not be further reduced in any manner
unless otherwise noted in this Code.
   (b)   Required Lot Area to be Maintained. A parcel of land may be subdivided
into two or more parcels, provided all lots resulting from such division shall
conform to all the lot area and width regulations of the district in which it
is located. A lot of record which conformed to the provisions of this Zoning
Code or any amendments thereto which affected its conformity shall not be
reduced in any manner which would make it non-conforming.
(Ord. 2009-17. Passed 9-15-2009.)
1299.04   VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS.

required enclosure, supplemental vegetation may be used for additional
screening as appropriate and when approved by the Building Department or the
Planning Commission, as applicable.
      (2)   All waste container enclosures shall be stained or painted to match
the color of the principal structure. Containers shall be adequate to hold all
garbage and biodegradable trash with cover closed. Covers shall remain closed

of Health and the requirements of the Village, to carry away the effluent from
such septic tank system installation in a manner approved by the Village and

over such driveway to prevent damage to the road berm, and until such

by a homeowner himself or herself on his or her own residence, such as
replacement or repair of lighting fixtures, replacement or repair of faucets,
installation of shelving units, replacement or repair of a toilet, and other
similar activities which, in the judgment of the Inspector of Buildings, do not
require the inspection and/or supervision of the Building Department to ensure
and secure the health, safety and welfare of the owners or occupants of the
building, dwelling or other structure in question or of the general public.
Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be deemed to render the Village or
any officer or employee thereof liable to any person for any damage or injury

title or tenant occupancy, the Chief Building Official may, at their sole
discretion, permit the establishment of an escrow account, into which an amount
of money shall be placed equal to 100% of the value of the uncompleted repairs
or corrections. This amount shall be established by the Chief Building
Official. These funds shall be disbursed only after verification from the Chief
Building Official that the work is complete. While all work must be reviewed by
the Chief Building Official for completeness and adequacy prior to the transfer
of title or rental occupancy, the Chief Building Official and/or the Village
assumes no responsibility that the amount of money held in escrow will be
sufficient to finance the necessary corrections. It shall also be noted that
the seller, their agents, or in specific cases when authorized by the Chief
Building Official, the buyer, shall be held responsible for the abatement of
all violations regardless of the amount of money held in escrow. The Chief
Building Official shall establish on the certificate of inspection a reasonable
time frame for the completion of the work. At the expiration date of the time
period set forth in the certificate of inspection, the building official or his
authorized representative shall inspect the work to determine compliance.

1468.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Walton Hills, Ohio, does ordain these flood damage reduction
regulations.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1468.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1468.27 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall at 7595 Walton Road, Walton
Hills, Ohio.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the

1468.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.” A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%

of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.” See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally- assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.” A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zone A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE).” The base flood elevation. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”
      (1)   The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure
below the lowest floor which is an unfinished or flood- resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a “manufactured home park”, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” A Federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village Flood Insurance
Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is: (1) built on a single
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area.” Also known as "area of special flood
hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. “Permanent construction” does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural pan of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure. provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.21   MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that Village flood maps,
studies and other data identified in Section
1468.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1468.27.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division (a) of this section, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (a)(1) of
this section.
   (b)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be submitted at
any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.22   DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rale Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1468.34 through
1468.39, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent

1468.33   ASSURANCE OF FLOOD- CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1468.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Divisions (a)(2)A. and C. through E. of this section.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1468.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26- 10.)

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board, provided that such person shall file,
within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26-10.)
1468.37   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village.
   (b)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Issuance of Variance. Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the items in division (b)(1) through (11)
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 2010-30. Passed 10-26- 10.)
1468.38   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

1490.01   SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as "The Exterior Property Maintenance Code" of
the Village and may be referred to in this chapter as "this Code."
(Ord. 1983-29. Passed 6-21-83.)
1490.02   FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Village structures
used for Country Home District, Business District, Industrial District and
Office Building District uses which are or may become substandard with respect
to structure and maintenance, and that conditions, including, but not limited
to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, appearance of the exterior
of the premises, existence of fire hazards and unsanitary conditions,
constitute a menace to the health, safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of
the residents and inhabitants of the Village. It is further found and declared
that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain
properties have the effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating
slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, such conditions will
grow and spread and will necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts
of public funds to correct and eliminate the same, and that by reason of timely
regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums and
blight may be prevented, the immediate neighborhood and property values may be
thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of Country Home, Business,
Industrial and Office Building District uses and immediate neighborhoods may be
enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare may be protected and
fostered.
(Ord. 1983-29. Passed 6-21-83.)
1490.03   PURPOSES; INTERPRETATION.
   The purpose of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code is to protect the
public health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing
the maintenance, appearance and condition of all Country Home, Business,
Industrial and Office Building District premises; to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators; to authorize and
establish procedures for the inspection of Country Home, Business, Industrial
and Office Building District premises; to fix penalties for violations of this
Code; and to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to
permit repairs. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for
the public interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.

prescribed in this Exterior Property Maintenance Code and the regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto, and no owner or operator shall be relieved from
any such duty or responsibility, nor be entitled to defend against any charge
of a violation thereof by reason of the fact that the occupant is also
responsible therefor and in violation thereof.
   (b)   Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Code, the respective
obligations and responsibilities of the owner and operator on the one hand, and
those of the occupant on the other, shall not be altered or affected by an

welfare or any hazard to the environment must be removed in accordance with
state and/or federal law. The Building Inspector shall give one thirty-day
written notice and a second written final notice of fifteen days if needed. The
costs plus fines thereof shall be charged to the owner of such land at a rate
which shall be just and equitable and which shall be determined by the Building
Inspector as indicated in this section and elsewhere in this code. Upon failure
of the owner to pay the cost plus fines within thirty days after billing, the
cost plus fines may be assessed against the land or a civil suit may be
instituted at the discretion of the Building Inspector of the Village. Such
assessment or civil suit shall be in addition to any other penalty provided.
   (h)   If the address of the owner or other person having charge of the land
is known, the notice shall be sent to the last known address by certified mail.

avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
   (d)   Refusal of Entry. Where the Property Maintenance Officer or his or her

basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of this Exterior Property
Maintenance Code exists on the premises. If the Court is satisfied as to the
matter set forth in such affidavit, the Court may authorize the issuance of a
search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of the premises
on which the nuisance or violation is believed to exist. Warrants for access
may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the Property Maintenance Officer
establishing grounds therefor.
