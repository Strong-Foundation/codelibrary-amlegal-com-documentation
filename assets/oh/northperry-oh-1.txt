EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (a)   (1)   Any news medium organization that desires to be given advance

   (a)   Each member of Council shall be permitted to expend up to six hundred
dollars ($600.00) per year on any equipment, supplies, programs, educational
materials, and similarly related expenditures deemed necessary by each
Councilperson which will assist such Councilperson in the performance of their
duties as a Councilperson and in enhancing their ability to carry out the
powers and duties of their position as Councilperson.
   (b)   Any equipment or supplies that are not exhausted, that are purchased
pursuant to this Council spending policy shall be returned to the Village
within thirty days after the Councilperson is no longer serving in the capacity
of a Councilperson for evaluation by the Mayor, pursuant to the Village’s
disposal of surplus property legislation.  If the property is not returned
within thirty days to the Village, the Village Marshall shall make arrangements
to pick up such equipment, supplies and related property from the Ex-
Councilperson.  The Mayor shall determine if the equipment, supplies or similar
property has any value or if the property should be disposed of, since it no
longer serves any valid purpose of the Village.  In the event the property is
going to be disposed of in accordance with the policy for disposition of
Village owned property adopted by Section
121.01, then the Ex-Councilperson shall be permitted to purchase such property
by paying the Village the original purchase price of the equipment, supplies or
similar property and retain it for their person use by electing to do so within
ten days after the determination is made by the Mayor the property may be
disposed of and has been declared surplus by the Mayor.  In the event such Ex-
Councilperson does not elect to acquire such property within ten days after the
declaration by the Mayor the property is deemed surplus, it shall be disposed
of by the Mayor in accordance with Section
121.01(d).
   (c)   In order for a Councilperson to be reimbursed for expenditures
permitted by this section, a receipt identifying the amount paid, the date
paid, and the vendor, must be submitted to the Village Fiscal Officer for
payment to be issued.  The Fiscal Officer shall retain a ledger or other
account to determine the total expenditures per year permitted to be made by
each Council member without further approval of Council and in the event such
Councilperson’s request for reimbursement exceeds the minimum amount permitted
per year by such Councilperson, payment shall only be made after approval by
the Village Council.  For any equipment purchased, the serial number, make and
model number, and description of the equipment shall be set forth on the
receipt delivered to the Village Fiscal Officer.
   (d)   In the event any purchases are made by  any Village official for which
reimbursement is made and which includes a right to a rebate for which the
Village official has received reimbursement, upon receipt of the rebate, the
Village official shall immediately turn over said funds to the Village.
   (e)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as to limit or
restrain Village officials from reimbursements permitted for expenses incurred
while conducting Village business, including educational and/or training
seminars and materials, or other expenditures made on behalf of the Village for
which the Village Council normally provides reimbursement, including
reimbursement to Councilpersons.

and encumbered in a specific appropriation line item for the permitted use or

amount if, the Fiscal Officer certifies that sum of monies in the treasury or
in the process of collection to the credit of the appropriation item or an item
for which the Credit Card was used and is free from previous and then
outstanding obligations or certifications.  If the card is used for more than
the amount originally authorized, the Village General Fund shall be reimbursed
for any amount spent beyond the authorized amount by the officer using such
Credit Card and such Village official is liable in person and upon any official
bond such officer has given to the Village to reimburse the Village General
Fund for the amount charged to the Village beyond the authorized amount.

Council to issue a supplemental appropriation, or make a transfer to the proper
line item account to cover the amount charged beyond the originally
appropriated amount.  If the card is used for more than the amount originally
appropriated and if for any reason that amount is not appropriated or
transferred as permitted by this section, the Village General Fund shall be
reimbursed for any amount spent beyond the originally appropriated amount by
the officer using such card who shall be liable in person and upon any official
bond the officer has given to the Village for reimbursing the Village General
Fund for any amount charted on the card beyond the appropriated amount.
   (h)   Whenever any officer authorized to use the Credit Card held by the
Village suspects a loss, theft or possibility of unauthorized use of the Credit
Card the officer is authorized to use, the officer shall immediately notify the
Fiscal Officer in the case of the Mayor, or the Mayor in the case of the Fiscal
Officer and in either case the Village Marshal and follow up such notification
with a written notice.  If the Fiscal Officer or any other responsible Village
official determines there has been a credit card expenditure beyond the
appropriated or authorized amount as provided in this section, the Fiscal
Officer, or in the event such expenditures are made by the Fiscal officer, the
Mayor shall immediately notify the Village Council and Village Solicitor of
this fact.  If, within forty-five (45) days after issuance of said notice the
General Fund is no reimbursed for the amount shown on the notice, the Village
Solicitor shall recover that amount from the officer who is liable under this
section by civil action in any Court of appropriate jurisdiction, unless the
Village Council in the meantime has authorized the expenditure in accordance
with this section.

   (a)   (1)   Each taxpayer or person who engages in business, or whose

file a return on or before April 30, and on or before April 30, of each year
thereafter with the Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable
upon request from such Administrator setting forth:
         A.   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by him, and/or gross income from such business less
allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned
during the preceding year and subject to the tax;
         B.   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings
and profits; and
         C.   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Administrator may require, including a statement that the
figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for federal
income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the
provisions of this chapter.
            (Ord. 225.  Passed 12-6-79.)
      (2)   On an after January 1, 2001, the Administrator shall accept for
filing a generic form of an income tax return, report or document if the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required to be submitted with the Village's prescribed returns, reports or
documents and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the rules or ordinances of the Village governing the
filing of returns, reports or documents.
         (Ord. 01-001.  Passed 1-4-01.)
   (b)   When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the
end of such fiscal year or other period. 
(Ord. 225.  Passed 12-6-79.)
   (c)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
three months beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal
Revenue Service for the filing of the federal income tax return.  No penalty or
interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.  Any taxpayer that has requested
an extension for filing a Federal income tax return may request an extension
for the filing of a Village income tax return by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a Federal filing extension with the Administrator not
later than the last day for filing the Village income tax return as required by
this section.  The Administrator shall grant such a request for extension for a
period not less than the period of the Federal extension request, and may deny
the taxpayer's request for extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file
the request, or fails to file a copy of the request for the Federal extension,
or owes the Village any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment or other charge for the late payment or non-payment of income tax,
or has failed to file any required income tax return, report or other related
document for a prior tax period.  The granting of an extension for filing a
Village income tax return does not extend the last date for paying the tax
without penalty unless the Administrator grants an extension of that date.
(Ord. 225.  Passed 12-6-79; Ord. 01-001.  Passed 1-4-01.)
   (d)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by this
chapter on such earnings and profits.  The taxpayer making such return shall,
at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes
shown as due thereon;  provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so
due shall have been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of
Section
171.06, or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
171.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return.
   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (e)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation,
subject to the approval of the Board of Review, that the return of an employer
or employers showing the amount of tax deducted by such employer or employers
from the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an employee, and
paid by him or them to the Administrator shall be accepted as the return
required of any employee whose sole income, subject to the tax or taxes under
this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or other compensation.
   Under such regulations as the Administrator may prescribe, subject to the
approval of the Board of Review, any taxpayer, in lieu of filing a detailed
return as hereinbefore provided, may file a sworn statement prescribed by the
Administrator of salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation or of net
profits as reported on his federal income tax return for the period involved. 
Such statement shall also set forth each adjustment made under the terms of any
Village income tax ordinance and the taxpayer filing such sworn statement shall
pay the tax hereby levied on the adjusted amount thus reported in the
statement.
   (f)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as may be necessary to ascertain whether
net profits allocable to the Village are being distorted by the shifting of
income, apportionment of expenses, or other devices available to a common
control.  If the Administrator finds that a person's net profits allocable to
he Village are distorted by reason of transactions with stockholders or with
other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directories, or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity or by some other method, he shall adjust such transactions so as to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village.  If
necessary, the Administrator may require the filing of a consolidated return.
   (g)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter, may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election
indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part hereof, shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (h)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment. 
(Ord. 225.  Passed 12-6-79.)
   (i)   Commencing with the 1994 tax year and continuing thereafter, any
person, eighteen years of age or older, or any entity subject to the provisions
of this chapter shall file any return due in accordance with the provisions of
this section with the administrator or the designated collection agency of the
Village of North Perry.
(Ord. 94-427.  Passed 8-4-94.)
   171.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,
shall deduct at the time of the payment of such salary, wage, commission or
other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%) of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee and
shall, on or before the twentieth day of the month following the close of each
calendar quarter make a return and pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted, subject to the provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (e) hereof. 
The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the
Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator.  Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the
contrary, on and after January 1, 2001, no non-resident employer, agent of such
an employer, or other payer that is not situated in the Village shall be
required to deduct and withhold taxes from the taxable income of an individual
unless the total amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld for the
Village on account of all of the employer's employees or all of the other
payer's payees exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for a calendar year
on and after January 1, 2001. 
(Ord. 261.  Passed 6-3-82;  Ord. 266.  Passed 12-2-82; Ord. 01-001.  Passed 1-
4-01.)
   (b)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source
is liable directly to the Village for the payment of such tax, whether actually
collected by such employer or not.  Such employer in collecting the tax shall
be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Village, as a trustee for the benefit of the Village and any such tax collected
by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the
Village, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   Such employer who deducts the tax in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) or more in the first or second month of a calendar quarter shall, or
before the twentieth day of the following month, pay to the Administrator the
amount of taxes so deducted.  Such employer who deducts the tax in the amount
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more in the third month of a calendar
quarter may, at his option, on or before the twentieth day of the following
month, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted.
   (d)   Such employer who makes such payments on a monthly basis only for the
first two months of a calendar quarter shall pay such tax deducted for the
third month of a calendar quarter at the regular time for filing the employer's
quarterly return of income tax withheld.  Such employer who, at his option,
makes such payment for the third month of a calendar quarter on or before the
twentieth day of the following month, shall have until the twentieth day of the
second month following the close of each calendar quarter to file such
employer's quarterly return of income tax withheld.
   (e)   The payments shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Administrator, setting forth the amount of tax deducted
for the month.  A receipted copy of such form shall be returned to the employer
to be attached to and filed with the employer's quarterly return of income tax
withheld.
   (f)   Provided, however, that no person shall be required to withhold the
taxes on the wages or other compensation paid to the taxpayer if such person is
not required to so withhold taxes on wages or other compensation by the
Internal Revenue Service of the United States.
(Ord. 225.  Passed 12-6-79.)

determination of the federal tax liability.

other similar assessment or charge against the taxpayer for the late payment or

employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute

   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         (b)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services that can
reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
173.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
173.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
173.051 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
173.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

173.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
173.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
173.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
173.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
173.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
173.062 of this Chapter.
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
173.03 (32) of this Chapter.

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
173.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
173.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
173.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
173.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
173.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)     When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
173.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
173.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
173.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
173.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return

         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
173.10 of this Chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period

described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
173.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

173.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
173.081 CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of this Municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality he shall not pay a total municipal income tax on
the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher of the two rates.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in this Municipality who
receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside this
Municipality, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax
on the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid
by him or in his behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.
   (C)   Any claim for credit for income taxes paid another municipality on the
same income taxable hereunder or claim for or assignment of any refund due to
the credit provided for herein, must file within three years from the due date
of the return. Failure to file such claim for refund or credit within the time
prescribed herein shall render such credit, claim for refund or assignment null
and void.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the year in which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
173.081 of this Chapter.

173.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
173.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
173.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
173.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the

173.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.

which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
173.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
173.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

173.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
               (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
173.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
173.10 of this Chapter.

agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement. 
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
173.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
173.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
173.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
173.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
173.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
173.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at
the address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)     A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
173.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter.
   
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
173.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
173.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)
173.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Ohio Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to

purpose in the Village shall file a written report within thirty (30) days
after any new tenant occupies any portion of the rental real property of any
kind within the Village to the Administrator as defined in Section
173.03(44) of the Codified Ordinances of the identity of their existing
tenants, and any new tenants, lessees or other occupants of the real estate,

rental real property shall file, within thirty (30) days after any tenant
vacates such premises, a report showing the date of vacation from the rental

after the effective date of this section the Administrator shall prepare a form
for reporting information required by subsection (A) hereof, and, upon request,
shall provide such form, without charge, to any owner, manager or other person
required to file reports, as set forth in subsection (A) hereof. In addition,
the Administrator shall endeavor to determine the owner, manager or other
person in control of all rental real estate located within the Village and
provide them with a certified copy of this section and the form to be utilized
as contemplated by this section. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of
such form from the Administrator, each person who would otherwise be required
to file a report as to any new tenants, shall also provide a report to the
Administrator, on the form provided by the Administrator, of all existing
tenants, lessees or other occupants of such rental real property and the
address and phone number, if available, of such parties.

separate violation of this section.

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

173.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 15-12.  Passed 12-3-15.)

the district wherein such premises are located under the terms and provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance.

purposes or for purposes of display of any vehicle; and further,  the parking
of any vehicle on any portion of a street, alley or public grounds without
valid license plates, or for a continuous period of more than sixteen hours,
shall constitute storage.

into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,
the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right

provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection

required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole

evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.

subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that
required the holder of the probationary driver’s license to operate a motor
vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or
vehicle registration.

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the

only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.

conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.

misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:

2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if

license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution. 
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. 
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic
violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
         B.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the
amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender
pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor           Maximum Fine 
First degree                        $5000.00
Second degree              4000.00

Misdemeanor not
    specifically classified 2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not

      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm

be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  (ORC 2909.03)

relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being

545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or

a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

CHAPTER 1109
Conditional Uses and Similar Use Review
1109.01    Conditional use zoning permit required.
1109.02    Designation as a conditional use.
1109.03    Conditional use review application.
1109.04    Review of conditional use by Planning Commission.
1109.05    Public hearing and notice by Planning Commission.
1109.06    Action by Planning  Commission.
1109.07    Terms and duration of conditional use approval.
1109.08    Revocation of conditional use approval.
1109.09    General criteria for all conditional uses.
1109.10    Similar uses.
   1109.01  CONDITIONAL USE ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional use zoning permit is
required and the application for such conditional use zoning permit shall be
submitted and reviewed according to the following review procedures.  (Ord. 19-
10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.02  DESIGNATION AS A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (a)    Certain types of uses are classified as conditional uses because of
their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district.
Consequently, the conditional use procedures call for a more flexible and
equitable procedure for properly accommodating such activities in the
community.  The forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude
and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied,
depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations, and the
availability of land. The purpose of this section is to provide controllable
and reasonably flexible requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow
practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time,
maintain adequate provisions for the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the Village's inhabitants.
   (b)    In order to accomplish such a dual objective, this chapter sets forth
a review procedure that enables a more detailed consideration of each
conditional use in regards to the proposed conditions of location, design,
size, operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic movement,
concentration of population, processes and equipment employed, and amount and
kinds of public facilities and services required, together with many other
factors. Review of this information by the Planning Commission is required to
ensure that each proposed conditional use is consistent with the intent and
objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.03  CONDITIONAL USE REVIEW APPLICATION.
   (a)    Application Submitted. The owner, or agent thereof, of property for
which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Zoning Inspector an
application for conditional use approval. The application for a conditional use
shall disclose all uses proposed for the development, their location, extent
and characteristics and shall include the items set forth below.
      (1)    Completed application form along with the application fee.
      (2)    A list of all property owners lying within 300 feet of any part of
the property on which the conditional use is proposed, including their
addresses and permanent parcel number and lot numbers, as shown on the current
tax duplicate in the Lake County Auditor’s Office.
      (3)    A development plan and associated documents as required by Chapter
1107, if applicable.
   (b)    Review for Completeness. The Zoning Inspector shall review the
submitted application for completeness according to Section
1107.02(e).
   (c)    Distribution of Plans. When the Zoning Inspector determines that the
application is complete, the Zoning Inspector shall forward the application to
the appropriate Village departments and professional consultants for review and
comment. Any reports, comments, or expert opinions shall be returned to the
Zoning Inspector within ten (10) days from the date the application is deemed
complete.
   (d)    Transmission to the Planning Commission. The Zoning Inspector shall
distribute the application and any reports prepared by the individuals in sub-
section (c) above to the Planning Commission, at least four days prior to the
time of the next regularly scheduled meeting.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.04 REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USE BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall review the proposed conditional use, as
presented on the
submitted plans and specifications, to determine whether or not the proposed
use is appropriate and in keeping with the purpose and intent of this Planning
and Zoning Code.
   (a)    The Planning Commission shall review the development plan for the
proposed conditional use according to the development plan review criteria set
forth in Section
1107.08, as applicable;
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall review the application to determine if
the establishment and operation of the proposed use complies with the general
criteria established for all conditional uses in Section
1109.09 and any specific requirements established for that particular use, as
set forth in Chapter
1131, Use-Specific Standards in this Planning and Zoning Code; and
   (c)    The Planning Commission may require additional plans and documents
further clarifying the nature and extent of the use or any aspect of the
application.
      (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.05  PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
conditional use. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by first class
mail or hand delivered to the applicant and to the property owners within 300
feet of the property on which the use is proposed, unless a greater distance is
required according to Chapter
1131. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate action taken on
such application. Further notice shall be provided on the Village’s website.
All notices shall be made at least 10 days before the date of said public
hearing. All notices shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing
and the nature of the proposed conditional use. The Commission may recess such
hearings from time to time, and, if the time and place of the continued hearing
is publicly announced at the time of the adjournment, no further notice shall
be required.  (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.06 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    The Planning Commission shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)    If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Planning
Commission to be appropriate and in conformance with the review criteria in
Section
1109.09, the Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use. In
approving any such use or structure the Planning Commission may attach
additional conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this Code, as may be necessary or appropriateto prevent or
minimize adverse effects upon adjacent property.
      (2)    The Planning Commission shall deny the application if the Planning
Commission concludes that, if completed as proposed, the development will not
be in compliance with the requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code. Such
action shall be stated in writing and include specific findings, based upon the
evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
   (b)    Failure of the Planning Commission to Act. If the Planning Commission
fails to act within 60 days from the date the application was deemed complete,
or an extended period as may be agreed upon, then the applicant may deem the
application denied.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.07  TERMS AND DURATION OF CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   (a)    Conditional use approval shall authorize a particular conditional use
on a specific parcel. Approval of a conditional use, pursuant to this Chapter,
shall be valid only for the use and the operation of such use as specified when
granted by the Planning Commission. The breach of any condition, safeguard, or
requirement shall constitute a violation of this Planning and Zoning Code.
Approval shall automatically be void if, for any reason, the conditional use
shall cease for more than one year.
   (b)    The conditional use approval shall expire one year from the date of
enactment, unless:
      (1)    In the case of new construction, work upon the structure shall
have begun above the foundation walls.

         (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.08 REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   A conditional use zoning permit may be revoked if the established conditions
for approval are violated. The Zoning Inspector is responsible for advising the
Planning Commission of any violations, and the Planning Commission may then
recommend to Village Council that it revoke the conditional use zoning permit.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1109.09 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following criteria.
   Furthermore, the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence that:

in accordance with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of this
Planning and Zoning Code and with the objectives for the district in which
located;
   (b)    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;

   (d)    The proposed building or use will not result in the destruction,
loss, or damage of any feature determined by the Planning Commission to be of
significant natural, scenic, or historic importance
   (e)    The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district.

amendments thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each
other, are permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are
created and are not addressed by this Planning and Zoning Code, this section
provides the procedure by which the Planning Commission may make a
determination that a new use is similar to a use permitted in a district.

   1111.04  MINOR SUBDIVISION/LOT SPLIT REVIEW.
   Procedures are herein established and intended to define the steps for
review and approval of a minor subdivision or lot split.
   (a)    Filing and Classification. An application, legal description and plat
of survey, complying with the Submission Requirements established by the Zoning
Inspector, shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning Inspector
shall review the application to confirm classification of the proposal as a
minor subdivision/lot split.
   (b)    Review by Zoning Inspector. The Zoning Inspector shall review the
application for compliance with the review criteria in subsection (c) hereof
and make a determination within seven (7) working days after the application is
determined complete.
   (c)    Review Criteria. The application for minor subdivision/lot split
shall be approved if it complies with the following.
      (1)    The proposed division of land must have frontage along an existing
improved public street and involve no opening, widening or extension of any
street or public utility. The right-of-way width at the end of a right-of-way
meant for future extension of the right-of-way does not constitute frontage
along an existing improved public street. If the installation of any of the
improvements described in Title Three of this Planning and Zoning Code are
needed for future construction on the lots, the proposed division shall be
reviewed as a major subdivision.
      (2)    The proposed division must be properly integrated with adjoining
developments or could be properly coordinated with the subdivision and
extension of streets to adjoining land.
      (3)    The proposed division complies with the planning principles and
other sections of this Planning and Zoning Code and other Codes and plans of
the Village, or the owner has received the necessary variances. Verification of
said variance shall be proided to the Zoning Inspector prior to approval.
      (4)    The proposed division of land shall be approved by the Lake County
General Health District in cases where there is no sanitary sewer. The owner
shall obtain approval for Household Sewage Treatment Systems (HSTS) (septic
tanks) from the Lake County General Health District (LCGHD) for the minor
subdivision being applied for and/or the remainder. LCGHD verification that the
minor subdivision and remainder conform to the LCGHD Regulations must be
submitted as part of the application. If all the proposed lots resulting from
the proposed minor subdivision cannot accommodate HSTS, the application will be
denied.
   (d)    Decision.
      (1)    If the application conforms to the review criteria in subsection
(c) hereof, then the legal description and plat of survey shall be approved and
stamped.
      (2)    If the Zoning Inspector determines the application is a major
subdivision or the legal description and/or plat of survey is not approved for
other reasons, the Zoning Inspector shall state the conditions that shall be
complied with before it will be approved.
   (e)    Review by Village Engineer; Recording. After approval of a sketch
plat, the applicant shall submit either a metes and bounds, deed description,
and/or plat as required, to the Village Engineer for review. The metes and
bounds, deed description, and/or plat shall conform to all applicable County
and State standards. If the same is found to conform to the approved sketch
plat and is otherwise satisfactory to the Engineer, he shall so certify his
approval thereon within seven working days after receipt. The approval shall
expire within 120 days unless the deed or plat has been filed and recorded in
the office of the County Recorder and the Commission has been so notified by

1121.02    Zoning District Map.
1121.03    District boundary lines.
1121.04    Identification of properties in Farm and Ranch Lands Protection
Program.
   1121.01 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and
to provide the Village Planning Commission with guidelines for future
applications, the Village of North Perry is divided into the following zoning
districts:
      P-1    Parks and Open Space
      R-1    Residential Single-Family, 3/4 Acre
      C-1    Commercial
      M-1   Mixed Use Office and Light Industrial
      I-1    Light Industrial
      I-2    Industrial
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1121.02  ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   (a)    The boundaries of the districts are shown on the map entitled
"Official Zoning Map of the Village of North Perry, Ohio”, or “Zoning Map”,
which is made a part of this Ordinance. The map and all the notations,
references, and other information shown thereon are a part of this Zoning
Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the district map and all the
notations, references, and other information shown thereon were all fully set
forth or described therein.
   (b)    No amendment to this Zoning Ordinance which involves a matter
portrayed on the Zoning Map shall be passed by Council as an emergency measure.
The Zoning Map shall reflect this change within thirty (30) days. Council shall
direct the Village Engineer to update the district map within thirty (30) days
of passage of such measure. Such amendment shall be effective as provided by
law.
   (c)    No changes of any nature shall be made to the official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official
Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the official
Zoning Map, which shall be located in the office of the Clerk of Council, shall
be the final authority as the current zoning status of land and water areas,
buildings and other structures.
   (e)    In the event that the official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed
or lost, the Council may, by ordinance, adopt a new District Map which shall
supersede the prior official Map. The new official Zoning Map may correct
drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official District Map but no
such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original Zoning
Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereof.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1121.03  DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   (a)    The Zoning District Map is not an exact or precise engineer's
rendering but shall be considered a detailed approximation intended to
accurately illustrate the zoning districts of the Village, however, the
language printed on the Map is certain, accurate, and controlling. The District
Map, including the language thereon, shall take precedence of a conflict
between the Map and language in the Zoning Code.
   (b)    Boundary Interpretation. All zoning district boundary lines shown on
the Zoning Map shall be interpreted and determined as follows:
      (1)    Where boundaries apparently follow lot lines and are not more than
ten feet therefrom, the lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;
      (2)    Where boundaries apparently follow streets, alleys or railroad
lines, the center lines of such streets, alleys or railroad lines shall be
construed to be such boundaries;
      (3)    Where boundaries apparently follow shore lines, the shore lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries and, in the event of change in the
shore lines, shall be construed as moving with the actual shore lines.
      (4)    Where boundaries approximately follow municipal corporation
limits, such boundaries shall be construed as following such limits.
      (5)    In all other cases, the location of any boundary line, unless
indicated by dimensions of the Zoning Map, shall be determined by the use of
the scale appearing thereon.
   (c)    Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street or public way is vacated
by official action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of the
street or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation and all area included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject to
all regulations of the extended districts.
   (d)    All territory which may hereafter be annexed to North Perry Village
shall retain the same zoning classification as existed in the Township, or
other annexed territory, at the time of annexation until the district map is
amended in conformance with the procedures outlined in the Zoning Code.
   (e)    Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the official District Map, or in other circumstances not covered
by any of the above statements on District Boundaries, or if there is a dispute
concerning the exact location of zoning district boundaries,  the Village
Planning Commission shall interpret the district boundaries.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1121.04  IDENTIFICATION OF PROPERTIES IN FARM AND RANCH LANDS PROTECTION
PROGRAM.
   The Village of North Perry partners with Lake County, Ohio in the Farm and
Ranch Land Protection Program (FRPP) to secure conservation easements for the
protection of productive farm and ranchland on eligible properties in the
village. Whenever a property owner in North Perry participates in the FRPP and
a conservation easement is created, the use of such land shall conform to both
the North Perry Zoning Ordinance and the restrictions set forth in the
conservation easement. The parcels with FRPP conservation easements may be
depicted on the North Perry Zoning Map for informational purposes only.

of this section.
   (a)    It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to prove to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission as part of the conditional use and
subdivision approval, that the land characteristics and physical conditions
make the creation and development of a flag lot reasonable and desirable.
   (b)    The creation of a flag lot should be limited to locations were the
existing public street frontage is subdivided into multiple, generally deep and
narrow, oversized house lots, such as where the general pattern of lot depth is

in order for the Planning Commission to approve the creation of a flag lot as a
conditional use:
      (1)    The applicant shall provide evidence that the proposed flag lot
cannot obtain the required minimum 100 feet of public street frontage due to
the existing lot development and ownership pattern.
      (2)    The existing lot from which the proposed flag lot is being
subdivided shall have a minimum of 150 feet of street frontage on a public

Inspector may declare the facility abandoned. If this facility is abandoned it
shall be presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding
property values, and being detrimental to the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, and general welfare of the community and shall be abated.
The Zoning Inspector shall then give notice in the same manner as service of
summons in civil cases, or by certified mail addressed to the owner of record
of the premises at his or its last known address, or to the address to which
tax bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such
abandoned condition within 60 days either by placing the facility in operation
in accordance with this section, adapting and using the facility for another
permitted use, or by razing the facility. Upon failure, neglect or refusal of
any owner to comply with the notice to abate such abandonment, the Zoning
Inspector shall take such action as may be necessary to abate said nuisance. If
reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the Municipality may remove or
contract to have removed the facility and assess the owner/operator the cost.

exceeds the bond covering such restoration, the additional costs shall be
charged as a lien against the property.

   The purpose of this Chapter is to promote and protect public health, welfare
and safety by
regulating signs of all types, while balancing the need for a well maintained
and attractive community, and the need for adequate identification,
communication and advertising. The regulations for signs have the following
specific objectives:
   (a)    To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and
maintained according to minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property
and public welfare;
   (b)    To foster public safety along public streets within the Village by
ensuring that all signs are placed in safe and appropriate locations;
   (c)    To reflect and support the desired ambience and development patterns
of the  various zoning districts; protect and preserve the aesthetic quality
and physical appearance of the Village; and promote an attractive environment;
   (d)    To allow for adequate and effective signs whose dimensional
characteristics further the interests of public safety and the needs of the
motorist, where signs are viewed from a street;
   (e)    To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free
expression is protected;
   (f)    To provide review procedures that enable the Village to adequately
evaluate proposed signs and their relationship to the site, building, and
surroundings; and
   (g)    To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
      (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)

(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1139.04  COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign
height, window area, and building frontage:
   (a)    Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)    Sign area shall include the face of the entire display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the structural support unless such structural
support is an integral part of the sign design.
      (2)    The surface area of a sign shall be computed by calculating the
area of the sign face. For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or
otherwise prepared and intended to include a background for the sign display,
the area or dimensions shall include the entire portion within such frame or
background.
      (3)    For a sign comprised of individual elements such as letters,
symbols, or other graphic objects or representations that are painted, attached
to, or otherwise affixed to a surface such as a wall, window, canopy, or
awning, the sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas of the
smallest geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes capable of
encompassing the perimeters of the individual elements comprising the sign.
When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated
by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining
the geometric shape, or combination of shapes, that comprises all of the
display areas, including the space between different elements. Minor appendages
to a particular regular shape, as determined by the Zoning Inspector or
Planning Commission, shall not be included in the total area of a sign.
      (4)    For freestanding signs:
         A.    The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces as prescribed above when two identical display faces are joined parallel
to each other and are within two feet of each other.
         B.    No more than two display faces shall be permitted for one sign.
   (b)    Determining Sign Height.
      (1)    The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from average
finished grade level adjacent to the base of the sign at its point of
attachment to the ground to the highest point of the sign including frame and
structural members. A freestanding sign on a manmade base, including a graded
earth mound, shall be measured from the top of the nearest street curb.
      (2)    Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be measured
as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point
of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments.
   (c)    Sign Setbacks. The required setbacks for freestanding signs are set
forth in Section
1139.05 for lots in R-1 Residential and P-1 Park Districts and in Section
 1139.06 for nonresidential districts. The required setbacks for a sign shall
apply to all elements of the sign, including its frame and base.

1145.08   Nonconforming lots of  record.
1145.09   Existing use deemed conditional use; permit required for change.
1145.10   Nonconforming site conditions existing at time of development plan
review.
1145.11   Nonconforming status.
   1145.01  INTENT.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any lot, use, building, or
structure that was lawful at the time it was established but which has become
nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this Planning and Zoning Code as
well as amendments made to this Planning and Zoning Code or the Official Zoning
Map.
   In accordance with the ORC 713.15, the lawful establishment of nonconforming
uses, buildings, lots, structures, signs, and other facilities is herein
recognized by providing for the continuance of nonconforming status subject to
regulations which limit their completion, restoration, reconstruction,
extension and substitution. While it is the intent of this Planning and Zoning
Code to permit such nonconforming status to continue until abandoned, removed
or abated, the continued existence of a nonconforming status is considered to
be generally inconsistent with the land use plan of the Village and should be
discouraged. It is further the intent of these regulations that any
nonconforming use, building, structure, sign or other facility shall not be
reconstructed, enlarged, restored, expanded or extended, except in accordance
with the regulations contained in this chapter. Further, the continuation of a
lawful nonconforming status shall not be construed as a reason to permit
additions to such nonconforming status not specifically permitted by this
chapter.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.02  LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   (a)    A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
   (b)    Ordinary repairs, repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
   (c)    A zoning permit shall be required for any change to a nonconforming
use/structure/lot beyond ordinary repairs noted in subsection
 1145.02(b).
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.03  COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING PERMIT.
   Nothing in this Planning and Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of
the construction and the use of nonconforming buildings for which a zoning
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Planning and Zoning
Code, or amendments thereto, provided that construction is commenced within
ninety days after such effective date and if completed within one (1) year
after the issuance of the zoning permit.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.04  NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS AND LAND.
   Where, at the time of passage of any provision of the Planning and Zoning
Code, a lawful use of land and/or structures exists which would not be
permitted by said provision, the use may be continue so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)    Expansion of Use Prohibited. No use shall be expanded, enlarged or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, but shall not
be limited to:
      (1)    Expansion of such use to any structure or land area other than
that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code, or
any amendment hereto which causes such use to become nonconforming.
      (2)    Expansion of such use within a building or other structure to any
portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of this Code, or any amendment thereto which causes such use
to become nonconforming. Except a nonconforming use located in a structure not
designed for any use permitted in the district in which such structure is
located may be extended throughout any part of such structure; provided,
however, that such expansion shall not be allowed unless off-street parking and
loading spaces required for such expansion can be, and are, provided in
accordance with the requirements and restrictions of Chapter
1137.
      (3)    An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal or previously approved or permitted hours of operation.
   (b)    Change in Use.
      (1)    A nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in
the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than
a use permitted in the zoning district in which the property is located.
      (2)    A nonconforming use in a structure not designed for a use
permitted in the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any
use other than a nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted
classification and of the same or lesser level of intensity and impact as
determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals or to a use permitted in the zoning
district in which the structure is located.
      (3)    The following list provides guidance for determining a more
restrictive classification of use. The most restrictive classification is shown
first. In general, a residential use is to be deemed more restrictive than
commercial, and commercial more restrictive than industrial.
         A.    Single-family Residential
         B.    Office
         C.    Retail/services
         D.   General Commercial
         E.    Light Industrial, Assembly
         F.    Manufacturing
      (4)    Once changed to a permitted use or to a more restrictive and less
intensive use in accordance with Subsection (d) (1) and (2) above, the use
shall not be changed back to the prior nonconforming use. The use is deemed
changed when an existing nonconforming use is terminated and a new use
commences and continues for a period of seven consecutive days, including any
change of use in violation of this subsection.
   (c)    Structural Alteration or Enlargement. No building or structure
containing a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or enlarged.
   (d)    Moving. No nonconforming use (and associated building or structure)
may be moved to any other part or parcel of land upon which the same condition
existed at the time the use became nonconforming, except to make it a
conforming use.
   (e)    Damage or Destruction. When a structure occupied by a nonconforming
use is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than sixty-six
percent (66%) of the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village
Engineer utilizing the footprint of the building measured around its perimeter
and including all levels of the structure, the structure shall not be restored
unless its use thereafter conforms to the use regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located. Reconstruction shall require a zoning permit,
be constructed and restored as previously existing providing the construction
and restoration is done within one (1) year from the date of said destruction
and such nonconforming use is recommenced within ninety (90) days of completion
of construction or restoration.
   (f)    Abandonment or Discontinuance. In accordance with ORC 713.15, if any
such nonconforming use is voluntarily discontinued for a period of one year or
more, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.05   NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Planning
and Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but
which does not conform to area or width of lot, yard dimensions, lot coverage,
height of building or other regulations of the district in which it is located,
is a lawful, nonconforming building or structure. Such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)    In the event such nonconforming building or structure is occupied by
a nonconforming use, the restrictions for nonconforming uses in Section
1145.04 shall prevail.
   (b)    Such nonconforming structure may be expanded, remodeled, or enlarged
on the same lot, provided such expansion, remodeling or enlargement is in
conformance with current version of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)    Should such nonconforming structure be destroyed by fire or other
casualty to an extent of more than sixty-six percent (66%) of the structure, as
calculated by the Village Engineer utilizing the footprint of the building
measured around its perimeter and including all levels of the structure, the
remainder of the building shall be demolished and shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)    Should the owner of the property intentionally demolish more than
fifty percent (50%) of the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village
Engineer utilizing the footprint of the building measured around its perimeter
and including all levels of the structure, the remainder of the building shall
be demolished and shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (e)    If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful
due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.

Code, or an amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which does not
comply with off-street parking regulations for the district or use in which it
is located may continue without such parking facilities. In the event an
existing building is altered or a use is changed or substituted in accordance
with these regulations, then additional off-street parking spaces shall be
provided as required in Chapter
1137.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.07  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Planning and Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Section
1139.12, Nonconforming Signs.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.08  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a)    Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of any
provision of this Planning and Zoning Code, which does not meet the
requirements of said provision, shall be considered buildable provided that the
proposed construction meets all setback requirements established by the
Planning and Zoning Code, except as otherwise permitted in this Chapter.
   (b)    No such lot or parcel or portion thereof shall be used or sold in a
manner diminishing compliance with lot width and area requirements established
by the Planning and Zoning Code, nor shall any division be made which creates a
lot width or area below the requirements stated in the Planning and Zoning
Code.
   (c)    Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance is of less width and/or lot area than the minimum width and
area required in the district in which the lot is located, the owner shall be
permitted to construct a new dwelling or enlarge or structurally alter an
existing dwelling to provide additional enclosed space for living or garage
purposes in
compliance with the following:
      (1)    The minimum required side yard may be reduced to ten percent (10%)
of the lot width at the building setback line provided that no one side yard
shall be less than ten feet.
      (2)   The minimum required rear yard depth may be reduced to twenty
percent (20%) of the lot length.
   (d)    If two or more vacant lots of record or a combination of lots and
portions of lots, with contiguous frontage in single ownership, are
nonconforming as defined in this section, such lots shall be combined in order
to decrease the level of nonconforming to the lot area and width regulations of
the district in which the lots are located.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.09  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of a
zoning amendment, is listed as a conditional use in the district in which it is
located, shall be deemed without further action to be a conforming use. Any
change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such use, site development
conditions or signs, or change in ownership shall only be permitted upon review
and approval by the Planning Commission according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1109.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)

REVIEW.
   (a)    If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a development plan
is required pursuant to Chapter
1107, then such site condition(s) shall be brought into compliance with
district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions.
   (b)    Existing site conditions include, but are not limited to, the
existing lot configuration and patterns of surrounding development; inability
of the applicant to acquire additional property; location of the existing
structures on the site in question; the amount or location of parking and
access on the site in question, and the location of utilities both on and off-
site. In such case, the Planning Commission shall approve a development plan
that reduces the existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent
practicable.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1145.11  NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   Any person or corporation claiming right of operation or use as a lawful

   1153.03  STREETS.
   Provision of Streets. In order to provide for streets of suitable location,
width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford
satisfactory access to police, fire-fighting, snow removal, sanitation and road
maintenance equipment and, to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient
system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design
standards are hereby required:
   (a)    Conformity with the Comprehensive Plan: The arrangement, character,
extent, width, use and location of all streets shall conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan of the Village of North Perry and to the following.
      (1)    Whenever a tract to be subdivided or improved which includes any
part of a thoroughfare as shown on the Village Comprehensive Plan, such part
shall be dedicated to the public for such purposes by the subdivider or
applicant.
      (2)    The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation for

schools, playgrounds, transportation, recreation and other community features.
   (b)    Connecting Streets:
      (1)    Continuation of Streets: Streets shall be so arranged as to
provide for the continuation of existing streets. Through streets connecting at
intersections shall be preferred in all instances over cul-de-sac and dead-end
streets. Designs shall be encouraged to eliminate a majority of cul-de-sac
options.
      (2)    Future Connections: Connections shall be provided to adjoining
properties for future access and interconnection of neighborhoods with
connecting streets.
      (3)    Local neighborhood Connections: Local residential streets shall be
laid out so as to provide for interconnection of neighborhoods. Commercial and
industrial areas shall be encouraged to provide such access alleys to provide
for reasonable safety and service vehicle access.
      (4)    Streets for business and industrial developments shall be planned
to connect with major streets so as not to generate traffic on local
residential streets.
      (5)    The intersection of service streets, or driveways from parking
areas, with major streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible
interference with the movement of traffic on the major streets and wherever
possible shall be located not less than 125 feet from another intersection of a
major or secondary street (measured from the center lines) or space not less
than sixty-five (65) feet from each other.
   (c)    Cul-de-sac Streets:
      (1)    Cul-de-sacs shall be provided with a turn-around. Dead end streets
are prohibited.
      (2)    Local cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted where parcels are
isolated with no future continuous street possible.
      (3)    If a cul-de-sac is not open in the direction of schools, parks and
playgrounds, a pedestrianway shall be provided.
      (4)   A collector street that is a temporary cul-de-sac due to
connections that have not been completed on adjoining properties shall not be
considered a permanent cul-de-sac if connecting streets have been installed to
these adjacent properties.
      (5)    Cul-de-sacs approved by a variance, which exceed the maximum
length allowed herein shall be considered as collector-type streets for
construction purposes.
      (6)    Under no circumstances shall a cul-de-sac exceed eighteen hundred
(1800) feet in length that shall be defined as the distance from centerline of
streets to the centerline radius point of the cul-de-sac.
         (Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1153.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)    Blocks shall be designed to accommodate lots of the size required for
the district as set forth in the Zoning Code and to provide for convenient
access, circulation and safety of traffic on the bounding streets. The lines
and boundaries of blocks shall be adjusted to conform to the topography and
natural features such as streams and lakes, and so that rear or side lot lines
will coincide with corporation lines.
   (b)    When a parcel is too small to be laid out economically for the use
intended and would result in fractional or odd-shaped lots or otherwise not
conform to the Comprehensive Plan, the Planning Commission may request the
subdivider to include adjoining unsubdivided land so a complete block may be
planned and developed as a unit.
   (c)    Block lengths, for a single-family subdivision, shall be planned to
average 1500 feet and shall not exceed 1800 feet or be less than 800 feet
unless approved by the Planning Commission.
   (d)    Block widths, for a single family subdivision, shall be planned to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except that a single tier of lots may be
required by the Commission to separate residential development from major
streets, adjoining nonresidential land uses, or unusual topographic or natural
features.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1153.05   LOTS.
   (a)    Lot Design. The size of the lot, width, depth, frontage, area,
setback distances, and in all other ways shall meet and exceed the existing
requirements of the Planning and Zoning Code. The lot width, depth, and
orientation shall be appropriate and in harmonious conformance for the
location, contiguous properties, type of development, and use contemplated.
Double frontage and reverse frontage shall be avoided.
   (b)    Building Sites. Each lot shall have direct access to a public street.
Each lot shall be designed to form a good site for the type of building to be
developed and the lot lines shall not be considered as merely forming a
geometric shape, which encloses the minimum area permitted. The lots shall be
more or less rectangular in form; triangular, elongated or other shapes that
restrict its use as a building site shall be avoided, where possible.
   (c)    Depth. The depth and width of commercial and industrial lots shall be
adequate to provide for the required off-street loading and parking spaces.
   (d)    Lots on Major Streets. Lots shall be of sufficient width and depth to
increase traffic and pedestrian safety and the privacy thereon.
   (e)    Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit appropriate
building setback from and orientation to both streets. Property lines at street
intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty-five feet for
residential, commercial and industrial as required by the Village Engineer.
   (f)    Lot Lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to the right-of- way. Where a street terminates on another to form a "T"
intersection, the side lot lines shall be planned so that a dwelling site will
not be directly on the projected line of the street which terminates. Cul-de-
sac lot lines shall be radial or perpendicular to the centerline of the right-
of- way.
   (g)    Lot Grading: Lots shall be graded so that water drains away from each
building at a minimum grade of two percent (2%) over a distance of (10) feet.
Surface drainage shall have a minimum drainage of one percent (1%) and shall be
designed so surface water will drain into a storm sewer drain inlet or natural
drainage basin or way.
   (h)    Topsoil: If the process of grading or re-grading any land area within
a subdivision results in the removal of topsoil, the topsoil shall not be
removed from the subdivision. Such topsoil shall be conserved and stockpiled
and shall be used as loam or top dressing for lawns, private property, or
landscaping within the subdivision. The process so described shall be approved
by the Village Engineer and substantiated with inspection records.

right of way.
      (1)    Sidewalks shall be a minimum width of five (5) feet along all
streets.
      (2)    Sidewalks shall extend to the curbs at all intersections and shall

   Easements granted to the Village shall not allow structures thereon except
as permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1153.09  PROTECTION OF WELLS.
   The subdivider shall provide a well log of all wells and ponds on contiguous
properties consisting of name of property owner, location, depth of well or
pond, and depth of water. Where a subdivision is proposed to be located in an
area in which there are existing water wells in close proximity, the Planning
Commission and/or Village Engineer may require that information be provided by
the Subdivider to determine the impact of the installation of the subdivision
on the water table servicing said wells. The Village Engineer shall determine
if high probability for impact exists. If so, he shall require that an approved
barrier method be placed on underground lines in such locations as he shall
designate to control said impact.
(Ord. 19-10.  Passed 11-7-19.)
   1153.10  OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENT.
   The following open space requirements provide for the creation of areas of
land to be left open as the community increases in population so the rural
character and flexible recreational use of open and natural and wooded areas
may be maintained for future generations and to provide for the funds to be
available to expand, equip, maintain, and operate such areas.
   (a)    New Residential Subdivisions:
      (1)    The Planning Commission shall follow the Comprehensive Plan and
recommendations of the Village Council to provide for a reasonable amount of
open spaces for the use of residents and property owners in and around the
subdivision, and the construction, operation and maintenance of such areas and
facilities.
      (2)    No new subdivision shall be approved by the Planning Commission
unless at least ten percent (10%) of the land area is set aside and dedicated
as public land for access to recreation, and conservation. Common ownership
areas and private property conservation easements, utility easements, setbacks,
right-of-ways and screening requirements shall not be included in this area and
calculation. Stormwater management ponds shall not be included unless they are
landscaped and developed into a viable recreational resource or natural
habitat.

   1301.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
   1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such
buildings or structures.  As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code, no plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if

      (6)   Any hearing(s) scheduled for accessibility issues shall cause the
Building Official or the appeals board to notify a local advocate organization

   (a)   Unsafe Buildings Defined.   Structures or existing equipment that are
unsafe or unsanitary due to inadequate means of egress facilities, inadequate
light and ventilation, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard.  Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings.  Where the Building Official finds
that a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in
the time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration.  Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition.  To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended
to be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the
structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapter 1 and 34 of the Ohio Building Code and this chapter.
(OBC 109)
   1301.08  CONFLICT.

requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. 
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules.  As  provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.
   There may be other requirements owners may be required to meet as set forth
by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities. 
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.
(OBC 102)

   (a)   Building Official.  The Building Official is responsible for the
enforcement of the rules of the Board and of Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791
relating to the construction, arrangement, and the erection of buildings or
parts thereof.  All building officials shall conduct themselves in a
professional, courteous, impartial, responsive, and cooperative manner. 
Building officials shall be responsible to assure that a system is in place to
track and audit all projects, to assure that all Building Department personnel
perform their duties in accordance with this section, and for the overall
administration of a Building Department as follows:
   (b)   Applications and Plan Approvals.  The Building Official shall receive

described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official.  When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders.  The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance
with Section
1301.06 to ensure compliance with the Ohio Building Code.
   (e)   Inspections.
      (1)   If the plans for the erection, construction, repair, alteration,
relocating, or equipment of a building are subject to inspection by the
Building Official, under Section 108 of the Ohio Building Code, the Building
Official shall cause to be made such inspections, investigations, and
determinations as are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has
been performed and the installations which have been made are in conformity
with the approved construction documents.  The Building Official shall identify
any special conditions that would affect the timing of inspections and schedule
inspections times mutually agreed upon by the Building Official and the owner. 
      (2)   Special inspections are as required under Section 1704 of the Ohio
Building Code.
   (f)   Department Records.  The Building Official shall keep official records
of applications received, certificate of plan approvals issued, notices and
orders issued, certificates of occupancy, certificates of completion and other
such records required by the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  Such
information shall be retained in the official permanent record for each
project.  One set of approved construction documents shall be retained by the
Building Official for a period of not less than one hundred eighty days from
date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by document retention
regulations.
   (g)   Department Reports.  The Building Official shall be responsible for
the submission of reports and any requested special information to the Board of
Building Standards as required in paragraph (F) of Rule 4101: 7-2-01 of the
Administrative Code.  Failure to submit these reports as required by rule or by
special request or inquiry of the Board of Building Standards may be grounds
for Board action as described in paragraph (F)(7) of Rule 4101:7-3-01 of the
Administrative Code.
   (h)   Liability.  Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.
(OBC 104)
   1301.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both.  Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.  The Municipality may institute injunction proceedings in Common Pleas
Court to abate the nuisance of failure to cease work after receipt of a stop
work order.

1311.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of North Perry Village, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  North Perry Village has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
         generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of North Perry
Village as identified in Section
1311.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
North Perry Village.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Lake County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
February 3, 2010; and Flood Insurance Rate Map Lake County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas, February 3, 2010.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by North    Perry Village as required by Section
 1311.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at North Perry Hall, 4449 Lockwood Road, North Perry, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant
or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements; and
      (2)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of North Perry Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 10-
01.  Passed 1-7-10.)
1311.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or
tidal waters, and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation is the
base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by North Perry Village's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the North Perry Village
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 16, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.

   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

would equal or  exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 10-01.  Passed 1-7-10.)

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
   A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or base
flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data reflecting
such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
 1311.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1311.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1311.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of North
Perry Village, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the North
Perry Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
North Perry Village's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the North
Perry Village boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
North Perry Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which North Perry Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1311.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (4)   In addition to the above, the Floodplain Administrator may
implement other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination
and subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases,
public service announcements, and other public information materials related to
the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures;
coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with
substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures
materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged
structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially
damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1311.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.   For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
North Perry Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1311.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1311.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of the Board
of Zoning Appeals. The members shall serve for a term concurrent with their
term of office as members of the Board of Zoning Appeals after which time they
shall be reappointed or replaced by the Council. Each member shall serve until
his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
North Perry Village Hall, 4449 Lockwood Road, North Perry Village, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1311.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         L.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1311.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 10-01.  Passed 1-7-10.)

            (Ord.  02-30.  Passed 8-1-02.)
   1321.08  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   To control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
operator shall adhere to the following planning and best management practices
as specified in the most current edition of Rainwater and Land Development,
where applicable:
      (1)   Timing of sediment trapping practices.
         A.   Sediment control practices shall be functional throughout all
phases of up slope soil disturbing activities.
         B.   Settling facilities, perimeter controls, and other practices
intended to trap sediment shall be implemented as the first step of grading
within seven (7) days from the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to
function until the up slope development area is permanently restabilized.
      (2)   Clearing and Grubbing: Clearing and grubbing will be done in two
(2) or more phases.  The first phase will include only those locations
necessary to install the perimeter soil erosion and sediment control, and storm
water control practices.  After the perimeter controls are in place and
functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing may continue. 
      (3)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas & Soil Stockpiles:  Permanent or
temporary soil stabilization shall be applied as described below.  Permanent
vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is achieved
which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, covers eighty percent (80%) or
more of the soil surface, provides adequate cover, and is mature enough to
control soil erosion and to survive adverse weather conditions. 
         A.   Denuded areas shall be stabilized within seven (7) days if they
are to remain inactive for more than thirty (30) days. This stabilization shall
be permanent if the denuded area has reached final grade.
         B.   Disturbed areas within fifty (50) feet of any water resource or
wetland shall be stabilized within two (2) days of disturbance if these
disturbed areas will remain inactive for fourteen (14) days or longer.
         C.   Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized within seven (7) days of
disturbances if these areas will remain inactive for thirty (30) days or
longer.
      (4)   Settling Ponds: Storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at
rates which exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through
a sediment settling facility.  When designing sediment settling facilities, the
following shall apply:
         A.   The facility’s storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total drainage area.
         B.   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment laden water.  The ideal drawdown time is from three (3) to four (4)
days or seventy-two (72) to ninety-six (96) hours.
      (5)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet and rill runoff from denuded areas shall
be diverted to a settling pond or treated by a geotextile silt fence or other
approved sediment barrier.  The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity of that sediment barrier.
      (6)   Storm Sewer Protection:  All storm sewer inlets which accept water
runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment laden
water will not enter the storm sewer.  In areas where construction will be
ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection shall be maintained
until all upslope areas reach final stabilization, as determined by the
Community Engineer.  The owner or operator shall be required to hydraulically
clean the storm sewers after the end of this period to the satisfaction of the
Community Engineer.
      (7)   Working in or Crossing Water Resources:  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources and their setback areas. If a drainage way must be
crossed by construction vehicles repeatedly during construction, an approved
temporary stream crossing shall be constructed.  Construction of bridges,
culverts, or sediment control structures shall not place soil, debris, or other
particulate material into or close to the water resources in such a manner that
it may slough, slip, or erode.
      (8)   Construction Access Routes.
         A.   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto surfaces
where runoff is not checked by sediment controls or onto public roads. Gravel
construction access drives shall be implemented as appropriate or as required
by the Community Engineer.
         B.   Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces and/or public roads at
the end of each day in such a manner that does not create off-site
sedimentation in order to ensure safety and abate off-site soil loss. Collected
sediments shall be placed in a stable location on site or taken off-site to a
stable location.
      (9)   Sloughing and Dumping.
         A.   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing has been
authorized by the Community, and where applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the OEPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing
bridges, culverts, and erosion control measures.
         B.   Soils prone to slipping, landsliding, or other instability, as
determined by the Lake County Soil Survey, shall not be graded, excavated,
filled, or have loads imposed upon them, unless the work is done in accordance
with a qualified professional engineer’s recommendation to correct, eliminate,
or adequately address the problems caused by the soil characteristics.
      (10)   Cut and Fill Slopes:  Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be
given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope drainage
area, groundwater conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (11)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels:  Outfalls and constructed
or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the
expected velocity of flow from a post-development, ten year frequency storm
without eroding.
      (12)   Disposition of Temporary Practices:  All temporary erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after
final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no
longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the Community Engineer.  Trapped
sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
      (13)   Control of Materials and Debris:  Site management practices shall
be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community’s water resources.  These practices shall include
but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, or gypsum.
         B.   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch
basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur.  A
designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
         C.   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage
area.  A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum
capacity equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the volume of the largest
container in the storage area.
         D.   Any toxic or hazardous waste shall be disposed of in accordance
with applicable laws and permits.
         E.   Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
in accordance with applicable laws and permits.  Runoff from contaminated sites
shall not be discharged from the site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for
development projects on solid waste landfill sites.     
      (14)   Pre-Winter Stabilization:  If the development area is, or is
planned, to remain active through the winter months, a Pre-Winter Stabilization
Meeting shall be held by the owner or operator, and the developer, engineer,
and contractor of the project with the Community prior to October 1, in order
to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment control as defined in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (15)   Maintenance:  All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
control practices shall be:
         A.   Designed and constructed to minimize maintenance requirements.
They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance
of their intended function.  The person or entity responsible for the continued
physical and financial maintenance of permanent erosion control measures shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the Community.
         B.   Inspected by the owner or person responsible for the development
area once every seven (7) days and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5" or
greater rainfall event.  A written log of these inspections and any subsequent
improvements to controls shall be kept on site and a copy sent to the Community
Zoning Inspector. The inspections shall include the date of the inspection, the
name of the inspector, weather conditions, the actions taken to correct
problems, and the date actions were taken.
      (16)   Underground Utility Construction:  Trenches for underground
utility lines and pipes shall be temporarily stabilized within seven (7) days
if they are to remain inactive for thirty (30) days. Trench de-watering devices
shall discharge in a manner that filters soil-laden water before discharging it
to a receiving drainage.
   (b)   To control increases in storm water runoff peaks and volumes and non-
point source pollutants, the following practices are required when determined
necessary by the Community Engineer in order to promote the intent and scope of
this regulation:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction through grassed
road ditches, rather than paved street gutters, discharging roof water to
vegetated areas or grass and rock lined channels, or other measures.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Inducing infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soils
where practice through construction of infiltration areas where soils are
suitable, retaining top soil for all areas to be vegetated, providing good
infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities, and other
measures.
      (4)   Providing detention and retention through permanent ponds and lakes
with storm water basins with proper drainage, multiple use areas for storm
water detention and creation, wildlife, and other measures.
