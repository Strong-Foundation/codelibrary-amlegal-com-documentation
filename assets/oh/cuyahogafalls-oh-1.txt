EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Planning Commission for report and recommendation.
      If any plan, design or other proposal concerning the charter, extent,
location or use of any public improvement or public property or change thereof
within the territorial limits of the municipality does not, under the
applicable provisions of this Charter, ordinances of the Council, or the
general laws of Ohio to the extent not inconsistent with this Charter or such
ordinances, fall within the province of the Council or other official or agency
of the municipality, then the submission to the Planning Commission shall be by
the State, County, District, School, Township or other official body, board, or
commission having jurisdiction over such public improvement or property in
accordance with the provisions of the general law of the State of Ohio. The
Planning Commission's disapproval may be overruled by the State, County,

      (Amended 11-7-00)
SECTION 2.2 ZONING ORDINANCES. 
Council may, from time to time, enact and amend such Zoning Ordinances and
regulations as it may deem necessary. The method of such enactment and
amendment shall be as provided by ordinance of Council and need not be as
provided by any State statute regulating or pertaining thereto, it being the
intention of this provision of this Charter to require only such method of
adoption or amendment and notice thereof as shall afford fair and adequate

such ordinances. In no case shall such notice be given less than seven (7)
calendar days prior to the adoption of any such ordinance or regulation.

standards as shall be prescribed by Council, including, but not limited to, the
existence of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the strict
interpretation of the aforesaid ordinances, resolutions, regulations, measures
or orders provided that the granting of such exception or variance will be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent thereof and that the public health,
safety, and general welfare will continue to be secured and substantial justice
done.
ARTICLE IX
INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM, RECALL
SECTION 1. INITIATIVE.
   The electors of the City shall have power to propose any ordinance or
resolution, except an ordinance for the appropriation of money or an ordinance
making a tax levy, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power
being known as the initiative. Only electors of the City may circulate
initiative petitions. An initiated ordinance or resolution may be submitted to
the Clerk of the Council by petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of
the electors of the City in which petition the petitioners shall designate a
committee of the petitioners to act in their behalf. When so submitted, the
Clerk shall forthwith determine the sufficiency of the petition and if found
sufficient, the Council shall at once have the proposed ordinance or resolution
read and referred to an appropriate committee which may be a committee of the
whole. A public hearing, to be conducted in such manner and preceded by such
notice, as the Council shall prescribe, shall be held on the proposed ordinance
or resolution not later than thirty (30) days after the date on which such
ordinance or resolution was submitted to the Clerk. The Council shall, within
forty (40) days after such ordinance or resolution is submitted take final
action thereon by enacting the proposed ordinance or resolution in the form
submitted or in an amended form or by failing or refusing to pass the same. If
the Council fails or refuses to pass such proposed ordinance or resolution or
passes it in an amended form, the committee of the petitioners may, at their
option, require that it be submitted to a vote of the electors either in the
form submitted or in the amended form adopted by Council, provided that there
is filed with the Clerk a supplemental petition signed by that number of
additional electors which, when taken together with those who signed the
original petition, will total at least twenty percent (20%) of the electors of
the City. Such supplemental petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days
after the passage by the Council of such ordinance or resolution or its
repassage over the Mayor's veto, whichever is later. The date of such election
may be fixed in the supplemental petition but not less than sixty (60) days
from the time of filing such supplemental petition and the Council shall
provide for submitting such ordinance or resolution to the vote of the electors
at the date so fixed, or, if not so fixed, at the next general election in any
year occurring more than sixty (60) days from the filing of such supplemental
petition. An initiated ordinance or resolution, receiving an affirmative
majority of the votes cast thereon, shall become effective on the fifth day
after the day on which the Board of Elections certifies the official vote
thereon.
(Amended 11-4-80; 11-2-10 )
SECTION 2. REFERENDUM.
   The electors shall have the power to approve or reject at the polls any
ordinance or resolution passed by the Council, except as hereinafter provided.
Only electors of the City may circulate referendum petitions. Within thirty
(30) days after the passage by the Council of such ordinance or resolution or
its repassage over the Mayor's veto, whichever is later, a petition signed by
at least ten percent (10%) of the electors of the City may be filed with the
Clerk of the Council, requesting that such ordinance or resolution be either
repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. If said petition is signed by
twenty percent (20%) or more of such electors, the date of the election may be
fixed therein, not less than ninety (90) days from the time of filing thereof.
When such petition is filed, the Clerk shall first ascertain the sufficiency of
the petition, and if found sufficient, the Council shall thereupon, within
thirty (30) days of the filing of such petition, reconsider such ordinance or
resolution. If upon such reconsideration the ordinance or resolution is not
repealed, the Council shall provide for submitting it to a vote of the electors
on the date so fixed, or, if not so fixed, at the first general election in any
year occurring more than ninety (90) days from the filing of such petition. No
such ordinance or resolution shall go into effect until approved by a majority
of those voting thereon, in which event such ordinance or resolution shall go
into effect on the fifth day after the day on which the Board of Elections
certifies the official vote thereon. When the Council by general law or under
provisions of general ordinance is required to pass more than one ordinance or
resolution necessary to make and pay for any public improvement, the referendum
provision shall apply only to the first ordinance or resolution required to be
passed and not to any subsequent ordinances or resolution relating thereto.
In addition, ordinances providing for an annual tax levy or for improvements
petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the foot front of the property
benefitted and to be specially assessed therefor, and appropriation ordinances
limited to the subject of appropriations shall not be subject to referendum,
but, except as herein provided, all other ordinances and resolutions necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, including
emergency ordinances and resolutions necessary for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, health or safety, shall be subject to referendum, except
that such emergency ordinances and resolutions shall go into effect at the time
indicated therein. If, when submitted to a vote of the electors, an emergency
measure be not approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall be
considered repealed as regards any further action thereunder; but such measure
shall be deemed sufficient authority for payment, in accordance therewith, of
any expense incurred previous to the referendum vote thereon.
   Ordinances or resolutions submitted to the Council by initiative petition
and passed by the Council either with or without change, but not submitted to a
vote of the electors shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as other
ordinances or resolutions.
(Amended 11-4-80.)
SECTION 3. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall
election, any elected officer of the City. If an elected officer shall have
served six (6) months of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be
filed with the Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name and address of
the person filing the petition and the date of such filing, and deliver to such
person a receipt therefor and attach a copy thereof to said petition. Only
electors of the City may circulate recall petitions. Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than two hundred
(200) words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at
least that number of electors which equals twenty percent (20%) of the electors
voting at the last preceding November election. Within ten (10) days after the
day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk shall determine
whether or not it meets the requirements hereof. If the Clerk shall find the
petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the particulars in which the
petition is defective, deliver a copy of his certificate to the person who
filed the petition, and make a record of such delivery. Such person shall be
allowed a period of twenty (20) days after the day on which such delivery was
made in which to make the petition sufficient. If the Clerk shall find the
petition sufficient, he shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver
a copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall
make a record of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five
(5) days after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council
shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than sixty
(60) days nor more than seventy-five (75) days after the date of such delivery.
At such recall election, this question shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall
(naming the officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?", with the
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively, and in the
event a majority of the vote is negative such officer shall be considered as
removed, his office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as
provided in this Charter. The officer removed by such recall election shall not
be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby. (Amended 11-4-80)
ARTICLE X

municipality, setting forth any proposed amendment or amendments to this

change shall be made that affects the substance or meaning of this Charter or
any part thereof or amendment thereto. All deletions must be set forth in a
Staff Note detailing the date of the deletion accompanied by a brief
explanation. The location of the Staff Notes will be at the end of the Charter.
   Following any election at which an amendment to the Charter is adopted or at
any time when obsolete language is deleted, the Director of Law with the
approval of Council, may, prior to reprinting the Charter, make such changes
therein, including the numbers, titles and arrangement of articles and sections

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

nominations closed and a vote shall be taken by written ballot, the Chair
appointing two tellers. Voting shall be by separate written ballot for each
office; and a majority of all members of Council shall be required for an
election. In case no election results from the first two ballots, the candidate
receiving the fewest number of votes on the second ballot shall be dropped from
the list of nominees; and similar procedure shall be followed with each
subsequent ballot until an election results. If the foregoing proceedings have
resolved down to two candidates and five ballots have been taken without an
election resulting, then the Temporary Chair or President, where applicable,
shall by a single flip of a coin being called by one of the two candidates
determine the winner. All elections by the Council shall be conducted in the
same manner. Once elected, the President shall be sworn in.

excused from voting may make a brief verbal statement of his or her reasons for
making such request and the question shall then be taken up without further
debate.
   (e)   Calling the Question. Any member may call for a statement of the

reconsider shall be made not later than the next regular meeting after such
action is taken. No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any

and Ordinances, a simple majority vote of Council is sufficient to pass any
motion.

first violation of these rules by a member shall result in the offending member

shall prevent personal reflections.
   (g)   Books, Papers and Documents. Any member of Council or the
administration discussing a question may read from books, papers or documents

the member and the President. During debate, members of Council must remain in
place, unless excused by the President, and no member shall withdraw from

119.01 RESERVATION OF EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY.
   The City of Cuyahoga Falls hereby reserves unto itself the power to
appropriate property by eminent domain to the fullest extent authorized by the
United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution.
(Ord. 129-2006. Passed 12-11-06.)
119.02 APPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY IN CASES OF BLIGHT.
   In addition to all other public purposes for which appropriation of property
is authorized by the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, and
without limiting the authority of the City to appropriate property for other
public purposes, the City may appropriate property to eliminate a blighted
area. As used herein:
   (a)   “Blighted area” means either of the following:
      (1)   An area in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the land area is
located in parcels that are blighted parcels and those blighted parcels
substantially impair or arrest the sound growth of the City, retard the
provision of housing accommodations, constitute an economic or social
liability, or are a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in
their present condition and use.
      (2)   An area that is not a blighted area pursuant to subsection (a)(1)
hereof, but for which all of the following apply:
         A.   The area is blighted within a definition of blight that is
applicable to a federal program for renewal or redevelopment and the area
qualifies for and receives funding from that program;
         B.   The federal money is essential to carry out the renewal or
redevelopment of the area;
         C.   Any blighted area as defined by subsection (a)(1) hereof would be
ineligible for funding by that federal program.
   (b)   “Blighted parcel” means either of the following:
      (1)   A parcel that has one or more of the following conditions:
         A.   Conditions that constitute a nuisance;
         B.   Environmental contamination;
         C.   Vermin infestation;
         D.   Tax or special assessment delinquencies exceeding the fair value
of the land.
         E.   Is a vacant commercial parcel. A commercial parcel is deemed
“vacant” if it is zoned and/or used for commercial and/or industrial purposes
and meets either of the following:
            1.   At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the floor space of the
primary structure has been vacant or unused for any lawful purpose for at least
six months, or
            2.   At least fifty percent (50%) of the floor space of the primary
structure has been vacant or unused for any lawful purpose for at least one
year.
      (2)   A parcel that has two or more of the following conditions:
         A.   Dilapidation and deterioration;
         B.   Age and obsolescence;
         C.   Inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation, or
open spaces;
         D.   Unsafe and unsanitary conditions;
         E.   Hazards that endanger lives or properties by fire or other
causes;
         F.   Non-compliance with building, housing, or other codes;
         G.   Non-working or disconnected utilities;
         H.   Is a vacant lot or contains a vacant structure. A structure is
deemed “vacant” if at least fifty percent (50%) of its square footage, whether
residential, commercial, or industrial, has remained vacant or unused for any
lawful purpose for a period of at least one year;
         I.   Excessive dwelling unit density;
         J.   Location in an area of defective or inadequate street layout;
         K.   Overcrowding of buildings on the land;
         L.   Faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility,
or usefulness;
         M.   An incompatible land use or a use that creates land use
relationships that cannot be reasonably corrected through enforcement of
existing zoning codes or other land use regulations;
         N.   Extensive damage or destruction caused by a major disaster when
the damage has not been remediated within a reasonable time;
         O.   Identified hazards to health and safety that are conducive to ill
health, transmission of disease, juvenile delinquency, or crime;
         P.   Ownership or multiple ownership of single parcel when the owner,
or a majority of the owners of a parcel in the case of multiple ownership,
cannot be located;
         Q.   Defective or unusual conditions of title.
   (c)   Notwithstanding subsection (b) hereof, a parcel is not a blighted
parcel if the conditions are consistent with those that are normally incident
to generally accepted agricultural practices and either the land is used for
agricultural purposes as defined in Ohio R.C. 303.01 or 519.01 or the County
Fiscal Officer has determined pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5713.31 that the land is
“land devoted exclusively to agricultural use” as defined in Ohio R.C. 5713.30.
   (d)   “Parcel” means as parcel of land having a distinct parcel number
assigned by the office of the County Fiscal Officer, provided that where
multiple parcels are owned by a single owner and contain a structure that spans
the parcel boundary line, then the multiple parcels shall be deemed a single
parcel for purposes of this Chapter.
   (e)   “Structure” means any building or other man-made structure the
construction of which would require a building permit under the City’s building
codes. Where a structure consists of multiple residential, commercial or
industrial units, the aggregate of all units that are physically attached to
one another shall be deemed a single structure.
   (f)   “Primary structure” means the structure on the parcel within which the
primary use of the parcel is made. “Primary structure” does not include
ancillary or accessory buildings or outlots.
(Ord. 129-2006. Passed 12-11-06.)

   When using eminent domain to appropriate property, the procedures as set
forth in Chapter

amended from time to time shall apply.

there is added a type of urban renewal or redevelopment activity not included
in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing
was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof which requires the acquisition of
property, or if there is any change deemed by Council to be substantial in land
use or redevelopment restrictions contained in the urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing was held pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, a public hearing shall be held on such urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan as modified prior to the approval thereof by Council
in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) hereof; and
      (2)    If such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, such general neighborhood renewal
plan or urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan as modified shall be

provided, however, if such plan has not been approved by the Planning
Commission, or if there were any partial disapprovals by, or adverse
recommendations of the Planning Commission pursuant to Ohio R. C. 713.02, not
accepted by Council by its modifications of the plan in accordance therewith,
then an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of Council shall be
required to pass such ordinance and, to the extent that such disapproval
involves the construction of an improvement or utility within the meaning of
Ohio R. C. 713.02, the concurrence of the head of the department or departments
having control of the construction of such proposed improvement or utility
shall also be necessary.
   (d)   The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal plan
should contain a finding that the plan conforms to the Master Plan and to the
workable program of the City and such other findings as may be necessary or
desirable, but it need not contain the other findings set forth below in
subsection (f) for approval of urban renewal or redevelopment plans. Such
approval of a general neighborhood renewal plan may be made before or at the
same time as the approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan for a
project within the general neighborhood renewal area.

redevelopment plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)    Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area

dwellings in conformity with acceptable standards are feasible and can be
reasonably and timely effected to permit the proper prosecution and completion

made available to such displaced individuals and families are at least equal in
number to the number of displaced individuals and families, are not generally
less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities than the dwellings of the displaced individuals and families in the
project area, are available at rents or prices within the financial means of
the displaced individuals and families, and are reasonably accessible to their
places of employment;
      (4)    That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise;
      (5)    That the plan conforms to the existing general plan for the
overall development of the City; and
      (6)    Such additional findings as may be required if Federal aid is
needed.

redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the City
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
Federal government, the State, any entity, instrumentality or subdivision of

   (c)    Disposition of Property. The Director of Community Development is
authorized to negotiate for the sale or lease of urban renewal property which
is not to be retained by the City for uses in accordance with the urban renewal
plan. Pursuant to Ohio R. C. 721.01, 721.03- and 721. 28, after its
determination that real property is not needed for Municipal use, Council may
authorize by ordinance the transfer, lease or conveyance of any real property
in accordance with and for the purposes of the plan, subject to such lawful
terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants, including all covenants running
with the land, to assist in carrying out the purposes of the plan. All
dispositions of real property shall be at not less than the fair value thereof
determined by Council based upon the proposed new uses and restrictions thereon
to be imposed thereon under the urban renewal plan by Council through zoning
ordinances, private covenant or otherwise. Such determination shall be made
only after obtaining independent appraisals of such fair value upon the
aforesaid basis, which appraisals shall not be binding upon the City. The
manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and may be by
negotiation, with or without any competitive bidding, and such competition and
award of a disposition contract may be based on factors other than price alone.
Two-week publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City shall be sufficient notice for the taking of competitive bids. The
financial and legal ability of those proposing to acquire or lease such real
property shall be considered in all dispositions. The Mayor and Director of
Community Development shall execute, on behalf of the City, such instruments as
may be necessary to transfer, lease or convey such real property in the form
approved by the Director of Law and authorized by Council, which form shall
include all covenants running with the land, including any portions of the plan
incorporated by reference. The Director shall execute any certificates of
completion of improvements or other appropriate instruments, on behalf of the
City, that may be necessary in accordance with any covenants in such
instruments of lease or conveyance.
   (d)    The Director or the relocation officer shall assume responsibility
for assisting displaced individuals, families or businesses in such manner and
form as may be authorized by Council, and he is authorized to expend funds
allocated or otherwise available to the Department for such purposes.

gifts of moneys, or real or personal property from persons, entities,
governments or taxing authorities to be used for the planning and financing of
such urban renewal activities. Accounts shall be maintained for the carrying
out of those urban renewal activities being financed by loans or advances from
the Federal government separate from any other City accounts, including City
accounts used to carry out any activities being financed by the City, and no
money or real or personal property of the City shall in any way be pledged as
security for the repayment of any Federal loans or advances, except the
separately described City financed portion of a project area set aside for such
purpose, together with the proceeds from the sale, lease or temporary operation

   (d)    An employee who has been laid off, suspended, is on a leave of
absence, or is on non-paid status of any kind with the City shall not
accumulate or receive sick leave credit for such period of time. An employee
shall not earn sick leave while using sick leave to the extent a single period
of sick leave use exceeds twelve (12) consecutive weeks. Sick leave taken shall
be deducted on an hour for hour basis from an employee's accumulated sick
leave. Sick leave shall not accrue for overtime or straight time in excess of
forty hours per week.
   (e)    An employee may use sick leave upon the notification of his
supervisor or other designated individual in accordance with the policies
established for call-in in his department. When making notification, the
employee shall state the reason for the request for sick leave. If such
notification is not made, the absence may be charged, upon the recommendation
of the department or division head, to leave without pay or a disciplinary
suspension.
   (f)   Upon retirement, or termination in good standing from active service
with the City and with ten (10) or more years of service with the City, all
eligible employees except the Police Chief and Police Captains shall be paid
one hundred percent (100%) of the value of their accrued sick leave credit up
to a maximum of nine hundred sixty (960) hours. Upon retirement, or termination
in good standing from active service with the City and with ten (10) or more
years of service with the City, the Police Chief and Police Captains shall be
paid one hundred percent (100%) of the value of their accrued sick leave credit
up to a maximum of one thousand five hundred (1500) hours. The payment shall be
based on the employee’s rate of pay at the time of the payment. Such payment
shall be made only once to an employee.
   An employee who:
      (1)   Has ten years or more service with the City, and
      (2)   Has a sick leave balance of at least nine hundred sixty (960) hours
(one thousand five hundred (1500) hours for the Police Chief and Police

eligible employees except the Chief of Police and Police Captains may cash out
accrued sick time up to three hundred and twenty (320) hours per payment. The
Police Chief and Police Captains may cash out accrued sick time up to five
hundred (500) hours per payment. These payments shall be based on the
employee’s rate of pay at the time of each payment. The eligible employee must
declare his intent to retire within three years of the declaration and notify
his Department Director and the Director of Finance of his election to cash out
sick leave as provided herein at least thirty days prior to the first
distribution of funds. The third and final distribution of funds shall be made
only after the employee has retired. All hours paid under this provision shall
be deducted from the payment of accrued sick leave as provided under this
agreement. Any remaining sick leave credit may be used until the employee’s
retirement date at which time all remaining sick leave balance shall be deemed
exhausted and no further sick leave payment will be allowed. Funds paid to the
employee on an annual cash-out basis may be rolled over into an employee’s
deferred compensation account as allowed by plan rule or paid in cash as
requested by the employee.
   For the purpose of funding this sick leave cash-out payment, the Finance
Director shall establish a fund and annually deposit a sum sufficient to cover
the anticipated payout(s) under this provision. Money set aside in this fund
shall only be used for the purpose of paying the benefit set forth in this
section and for no other purpose.
   (g)    Sick leave credit transferred into the City from the State or any
other political subdivision shall not be converted into cash benefits. For the
purposes thereof, sick leave credit earned in Cuyahoga Falls employment shall
be the first charged for authorized illness.
   (h)    In the event of death of an employee, unused sick leave in the
maximum amount defined in subsection (f) hereof, shall become payable in a lump
sum in the employee's name and given to his spouse or his estate if no spouse
survives. Only sick leave credit earned by employment with the City may be
converted into cash benefits upon retirement, disability retirement or death.
   (i)    The responsible department or division head may require that an
employee requesting sick leave furnish or submit to any or all of the following
before any request for sick leave shall be approved:
      (1)    A detailed statement specifying the exact nature of the illness or
injury; the name, address and phone number of the treating physician; and the
anticipated number of days required to treat such illness or injury.
      (2)    A medical report from the employee's physician containing the
information specified in subsection (i)(1) hereof.
      (3)    That the employee submit to a physical/psychological exam by a
physician/ psychiatrist/psychologist of the City's choice. The cost of any such
required examination shall be borne by the City.
   (4)    Such exam shall relate only to the nature of the employee's illness.
Failure to furnish, refusal to submit to or falsification of any of the above
shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal.
   (j)    Each department or division head shall maintain accurate attendance
records of each employee under his or her supervision and shall report bi-
weekly to the Finance Department any time taken off by an employee. For an
employee to return to work with pay or receive sick leave benefits after being
absent on three consecutive scheduled work days, he shall submit to the
department head a satisfactory written statement attesting to the nature of his
illness or disability and shall obtain the certificate of an attending
physician all attesting to the propriety and reasonableness of the necessity to
utilize sick leave pay benefits. Failure to provide or falsification of the
above shall be grounds for denial of sick pay and/or disciplinary action,
including dismissal. The Finance Director shall provide a written summary of
each City employee's total sick leave absences and cash payments to Council, on
an annual basis, by no later than January 30th of the next calendar year.
   (k)    In special and meritorious cases of illness, or job related injury,
sick leave may be extended or adjusted by order of Council. A request for an
extension, accompanied by a certification of a licensed physician shall be
submitted by such department or division head to Council at its next scheduled
meeting with a written opinion by such department or division head as to the
merit of such request.
   (1)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with existing
unused sick leave credit in any department of the City where attendance records
are maintained and credit has been given employees for unused sick leave.

service with a sick leave balance of at least 320 hours at the beginning of the
calendar year for which this sick leave incentive program applies shall have

of pay for the year in which the sick leave incentive was earned.
         B.    An employee who used more than zero but not more than eight
hours of sick leave may convert forty (40) hours of sick leave at a rate of 75%
of the employee's hourly base rate of pay for the year in which the sick leave
incentive was earned.
         C.    An employee who used more than eight but not more than sixteen
hours of sick leave may convert forty (40) hours of sick leave at a rate of 60%
of the employee's hourly base rate of pay for the year in which the sick leave
incentive was earned.
         D.    An employee who used more than sixteen but not more than twenty-
four hours of sick leave may convert forty (40) hours of sick leave at a rate

and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made,
the Director of Finance shall give not less than five days written notice in
the manner prescribed herein to the vendor to show cause at a time and place
fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for
such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the vendor may appear and
offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so
fixed. After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in
the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after

serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Mayor shall fix a time
and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such
vendor at the vendor’s last known place of address. The findings of the Mayor
shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the
manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to
be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.

the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient
to the vendor.

Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the vendor,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the vendor who collected the tax.

net profit to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero,
with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to

person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a

carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division

for federal income tax purposes, and that is subject to tax on its net profits

more of the following:
         i.   Separate accounting;

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in Division (c)(1) or (2) of this Section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this Division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under
164.14 of this Chapter.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. The
taxpayer will not be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
that Municipal Corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation. This Division applies solely for the purpose
of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to a municipal corporation under this Section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in Division (a) or Division (b)
of this Section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's
ratios the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner

   (k)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of this Section apply to such apportionment except as otherwise
provided in this division.
   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on
or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed
amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of
each municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment
provisions authorized in this division. the taxpayer is required to file a net
profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to
notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying
remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located. unless
the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that
municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the
employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
   After the taxpayer makes the initial election. the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.

remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting

notwithstanding division (d) of this section. any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
   (m)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting. or a tax
administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or a
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (b) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
   (n)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 164.10.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         i.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         i.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 164.08 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity's net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
groups and sitused to municipal corporation.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         i.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
164.08 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         ii.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (5)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under Section
164.08 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in

quarter.
      (2)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Municipality if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer in
the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three hundred ninety-nine
dollars, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to
be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any

withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld. The taxes withheld

withheld amount is remitted to the Municipality.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, every employer is
required to file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
which must include:
      (1)   A list of the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whom qualifying wage tax was withheld or should have been

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this Section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this Section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this Division, a tip or gratuity is

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this Section.

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in Division (d)(2) of this Section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in Division (b)(1) of this Section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under Division (d)(1) of this Section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in Division (d)(2) of
this Section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
must withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
164.05 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this Section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
 164.10 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.12 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the
taxpayer is entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding
payment, or credit from another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this Section:
         i.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         ii.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this Division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         iii.   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing a joint return are required to file a joint
declaration of estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
164.13(g) of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this Section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         i.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         ii.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         iii.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         iv.    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (c)(1)(i) through
(iv) of this Section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
 164.13 of this Chapter.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest shall be imposed pursuant to Section
164.21 of this Chapter. However, if the underpayment is due to reasonable cause
as described in Division (e) of this Section penalty and interest will not be
imposed. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         i.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         ii.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         iii.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         iv.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this Section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
Division (d) of this Section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this Section will not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
164.13 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 4-2018. Passed 1-22-18.)
164.13 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
164.10(c) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

during a tax year or are older than eighteen, are required to file an annual
municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of income or

the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, the return required of that
individual must be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized

of the person or property of that individual. Such duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual must provide, with the filing of the
return, appropriate documentation to support that they are authorized to file a
return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. This notice shall include any
legally binding authorizations, and contact information including name,
address, and phone number of the duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator,
fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust must be completed

   (e)   Spouses are permitted to file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this Section must contain
the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of

      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
Section, copies of the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this Section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this Section, copies of the following documents: the taxpayer's
Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form
1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund
request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the
adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this Division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer must provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under Division (f) of
this Section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each individual
income tax return required to be filed under this Section shall be completed
and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed
for the filing of state individual income tax returns under Division 5747.08(G)
of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Municipality
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net

Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on

      (3)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed by
an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the
Municipality shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net
profits if the amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to Division (h)(1) of this Section must file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under Division (f)(3) and (4) of this
Section.
   (i)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period, the
date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim,
statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the
date of delivery or the date of payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the
event there is more than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on
the cover by the postal service.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
164.10 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as
credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with
the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this Section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return. The return or instructions accompanying the
return must also indicate that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the
preparer or other person to provide the Tax Administrator with information that
is missing from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information
about the examination or other review of the return or the status of the
taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the
Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization
by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator
about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator
from contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinance
and the rules and regulations adopted by the Municipality, and provided that
the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies
with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this Division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
 164.11 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipality for a taxable year if
both of the following conditions apply:
         i.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipality, and the
person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.
         ii.   The person no longer provides services in the municipality, and
does not expect to be subject to the municipality's income tax for the taxable
year. The person is required to provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipality. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipality, make any sales in the municipality, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipality during the
taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipality for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipality, if such
a registration is required by the municipality's ordinances or rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         iii.   If a person submits an affidavit described in Division (n)(2)
of this Section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
Division (n) of this Section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
   (o)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
(Ord. 68-2016. Passed 9-26-16.)
164.14 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Where a resident of the City of Cuyahoga Falls is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipal corporation or Joint Economic
Development District, he or she shall not pay a total municipal income tax
greater than the tax imposed at a higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City of Cuyahoga Falls,
who receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal
service compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside
the City of Cuyahoga Falls, if it is made to appear that he or she has paid a
municipal income tax on the same income taxable under this Section to another
municipal corporation or Joint Economic Development District, shall be allowed
credit against the tax imposed by this Section of the amount so paid or paid on
their behalf to such other municipality or Joint Economic Development District.
The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this Section on such income
earned in such other municipality, municipalities, or Joint Economic
Development District or districts where such tax is paid.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.15 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   i.   Except as provided in Division (a)(2)(ii) of this Section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         ii.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in Division (a)(2)(i) of this
Section computed without regard to Division (a)(2)(ii) of this Section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         iii.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to
any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in Division (d) of this Section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this Section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
Section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this Section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this Section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.16 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 164.19 of this Chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
164.19, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
164.19 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.17 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return will automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
Municipality’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return will automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a written
request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of
the date for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request
is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator must grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension of
time to pay any tax due.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under Section 5747.08(G) of the Ohio Revised
Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
   (f)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (a), (b), (c), or (e) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (f) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars.
   Division (f) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (a) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (a) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (c) of this section. (Ord. 114-2023. Passed 11-13-23.)
164.18 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer who is otherwise permitted to do so under this
Chapter or under Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax
Administrator before filing the amended return, following the provisions of
Section
164.09 of this Chapter.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under Division (b)(2) of this Section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
164.33 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this Division within the period prescribed by Section
164.19(b)(1) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that Division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that Division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
Division (c)(2) of this Section, a request filed under this Division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
164.19 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in Division (c)(2) of this Section,
the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.19 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this Section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the Finance
Director for payment. Except as provided in Division (b)(3) of this Section,
the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request
for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount
of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
164.32 of this Chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in Division (b) of this Section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
164.21(a)(4) of this Chapter.
   (e)   As used in this Section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
164.21 of this Chapter. (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.20 DOMICILE.
   (a)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return. Domicile differs from
residency. Although a person may have multiple residences, a person can have
only one domicile.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
Division (a)(1) of this Section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
      (2)   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
      (3)   The address on the individual's driver's license;
      (4)   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
      (5)   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the individual;
      (6)   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding the
individual's residency;
      (7)   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
      (8)   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation or state where the educational institution is located;
      (9)   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this Division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this Section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (c)   All applicable factors are provided in Section 718.012 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)

      (2)   This Section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date will be subject to
the ordinances and rules and regulations, as adopted from time to time before
January 1, 2016. (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (c)   The Municipality shall impose on a taxpayer, employer, agent of the
employer, and any other payer, and will attempt to collect, the interest
amounts and penalties prescribed in this Section when the taxpayer, employer,
agent of the employer, or any other payer for any reason fails, in whole or in
part, to make to the Municipality timely and full payment or remittance of
income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file timely with the
Municipality any return required to be filed.
      (1)   Interest shall be imposed at the rate defined as "interest rate as

each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon for each month, or any
fraction thereof, during which the return remains unfiled regardless of the
liability shown thereon. The penalty shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars
for each failure.
         (ii)    For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, with respect
to returns other than estimated income tax returns, the Municipality may impose
a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each failure to timely file
each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon, except that the
Municipality shall abate or refund the penalty assessed on a taxpayer's first
failure to timely file a return after the taxpayer files that return.
            (Ord. 114-2023. Passed 11-13-23.)

during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator is required to conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular
business hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A
taxpayer who is unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit because the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   (d)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the

attorney.
   (e)   The taxpayer or the person conducting the audit may record,

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this Section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and must be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This Division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

Administrator compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the
production of books, papers, records, or federal and state income tax returns.

fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

in the best interest of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions the Tax Administrator requires.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or installment
payment plan agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim is not
appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or installment payment plan agreement with respect to a
claim shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties
to the compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect
the liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or installment payment plan agreement with respect
to a claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or
agreement or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by
misrepresentation of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the
compromise or agreement and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties
or interest that would have accrued in the absence of the compromise or
agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator has the sole discretion to determine whether
or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed through
the duration of any compromise or installment payment plan agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not
an installment payment plan agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's
failure to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax

agreement. (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.27 REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may

document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
164.21 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section

      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
164.21 of this Chapter.

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,

Section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   The taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
164.29 of this Chapter.
   (e)   If the Tax Administrator provides written advice under this Section,
the opinion must include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in Division (c) of this Section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this Section.
   (g)   This Section binds the Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

opinion does not bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this Section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this Section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under Division (f) of this Section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.31 ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this Section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this Division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this Section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
Section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this Section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in Division (b)(1) of this Section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either. Nothing in this Division prevents the Tax
Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the person
if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax
Review.
         (Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.32 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Chapter 718 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the Mayor of Cuyahoga Falls. This member may be an employee of the
Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or
the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the
Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor.
      (4)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this Section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's right to
appeal the assessment. The notification must include the manner in which the
taxpayer may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should
be directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under Division (c)
of this Section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the hearing
unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this Section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.33 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   i.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes, penalties,
and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the latter of:
            a)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            b)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         ii.   The time limit described in Division (a)(1)(i) of this Section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in Division (c) of this Section.
      (2)   As used in this Section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         i.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
164.31 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         ii.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
164.19 of this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal, an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, the Local Board of Tax
Review, the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
164.19 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by Division
(d) of this Section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter.

levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this Chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this Chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
164.33.
   (b)   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this Chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
164.13 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 93-2015. Passed 11-23-15.)
164.36 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, Section or part of this Chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, Section or part of this Chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, Sections or other
parts of this Chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this Chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, Section
or part thereof not been included in this Chapter.

(Ord. 88-2007. Passed 7-23-07.)
   181.03 COMPETITIVE BID DEFECTS.
   It is the policy of the City of Cuyahoga Falls that competitive bids should
be fairly judged on the relative merits of the bids. Accordingly, the City will
not disqualify bids that are otherwise
responsive based on immaterial defects or omissions: the only result of which
would be to deprive on a technicality the public of the benefits of what may be
the best bid.
   (a)    Failure to include with a competitive bid, where and when required by
the contract documents or the Codified Ordinances, the original of either a bid
bond or a certified check in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount
required by the contract documents as and for a bid bond, as security for the
City should the bidder be awarded the contract and fail to enter into it, is a
fatal defect and such bid shall be automatically rejected as not being
responsive.
   (b)    Failure to sign a bid proposal or to identify the bidder in each
place required in the bid documents or to otherwise fail to complete each
component of the bid documents does not automatically result in rejection of
the bid, but is a defect that may be waived by the Board of Control provided
that the balance of the documents signed and submitted by the bidder adequately
identify the bidder and contain a definite and responsive legal offer to
perform the work or services bid on for a specific price.
   (c)    Failure to bid on an alternate shall not disqualify a bidder from
consideration on the base bid or on other alternates.
   (d)    Failure to meet specifications or taking exception to specifications
may be waived where the Board of Control determines that the specifications as
bid either enhance or do not materially affect the quality of the
specifications.
   (e)    Any bid defect not addressed in subsections (a) to (d) hereof may be
waived by the Board of Control when, using generally accepted principles of
Ohio competitive bidding law, the defect does not affect or undermine the
competitive nature of the bid, the competitive bidding process itself, the
public's right to and interest in competitive bids, or appear to be the result
of fraud, undue influence or corruption. When the Board of Control determines
that the defect or defects are not capable of waiver, the bid or bids
containing the defect or defects shall be rejected as not being responsive to
the invitation to bid.
   181.04 AWARD AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACTS.
    With respect to the award of any competitively bid contract, the award and
execution of the contract shall be made within sixty days after the date on
which the bids are opened unless otherwise provided in the bid specifications
or unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by
mutual consent of the City and the bidder whose bid the City accepts and with
whom the City subsequently awards and executes a contract. The contractor, upon
request, is entitled to a notice to proceed with the work by the City upon
execution of the contract. No contract to which this section applies shall be
entered into if the price of the contract, or if the project involves multiple
contracts where the total price of all contracts for the project is in excess
of twenty percent above the engineer's estimate thereof. No contract shall be
entered into until the industrial commission has certified that the person so
awarded the contract has complied with Ohio R.C. 4123.01 to 4123.94, until, if
the bidder so awarded the contract is a person nonresident of this state, such
person has filed with the secretary of state a power of attorney designating
the secretary of state as its agent for the purpose of accepting service of
summons in any action, until the contractor has provided the necessary Drug
Free Workplace and E.E.O. certifications, until the contract and bond, if any,
are submitted to the Law Director and his approval as to form certified
thereon, and until the Director of Finance has certified the appropriation of
funds therefore. (Ord. 48-2024. Passed 6-10-24.)
   181.05 PAYMENTS, PARTIAL PAYMENTS.
   (a)    The unit or lump sum price stated in the contract shall be used in
determining the amount to be paid and shall constitute full and final
compensation for all the work.
   (b)    Partial payment to the contractor for work performed under the lump
sum price shall be based on a schedule prepared by the contractor and approved
by the City Engineer who shall apportion the lump sum price to the major
components entering into or forming a part of the work under the lump sum
price. Partial payment to the contractor for work performed under the unit
price shall be based on work completed and material incorporated into the
project as certified by the contractor and approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)    Partial payments to the contractor for labor performed under either a
unit or a lump sum price contract shall be made at the rate of ninety percent
(90%) of the amounts submitted by the contractor and approved by the City
Engineer.
 
   181.06 ALTERATION OR MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS.
   (a)    Except when otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing the
contract, in addition to the requirements set out in Ohio R.C. 735.07:
      (1)    No contract shall be altered or modified to require additional
payment in an amount exceeding in the aggregate ten percent (10%) of the total
original contract price or ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or the maximum
provided in the ordinance authorizing the contract, whichever is greater,
without the approval of City Council; and
      (2)    No contract to provide goods or services for a specific term of
months or years shall be altered or modified to extend the term of said
contract in excess of six months without the approval of City Council.
 
   (b)    No contractor may recover anything for work or material because of
any alteration or modification unless the alteration or modification is made in
accordance with the requirements set out herein provided, however, that in the
case of an emergency the Board of Control may authorize additional work in
excess of the limits herein which shall be presented to Council for
ratification as soon as practicable.
   181.07 EMPLOYERS AWARDED CITY CONTRACTS TO MAINTAIN DRUG FREE WORKPLACE.
    (a)   No contract awarded through the process of competitive bidding, other
than contracts pursuant to Ohio R.C. 125.04, shall be awarded to any bidder who
does not certify that the following requirements have been met:
      (1)    A statement has been published and provided to employees notifying
them that the manufacture, use, possession, or distribution of drugs in the
work place is prohibited, as well as a specification of the disciplinary action

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine

   (a)    The Mayor, or his designee, shall issue a permit as provided for
herein when, from a consideration of the application and from such other
information as may otherwise be obtained, it is determined that:
       (1)    The conduct of the Parade or Public Assembly will not
substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other pedestrian or
vehicular traffic contiguous to its route or location;
       (2)    The conduct of the Parade, or Public Assembly will not require
the diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police the
line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police
protection of the Municipality;
       (3)   The concentration of persons, animals, and vehicles at Public
Assembly points of the Parade or Public Assembly will not unduly interfere with
proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous
to such Public Assembly areas;
       (4)    The conduct of the Parade or Public Assembly is not reasonably
likely to cause injury to persons or property;
       (5)    The Parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its
point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en route;
       (6)    Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or
will be made available in or adjacent to any Public Assembly areas;
       (7)    There are sufficient parking places near the site of the Parade
or Public Assembly to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected;
       (8)    The applicant has secured the police protection, if any, required
under Section
309.08 ;
       (9)    Such Parade or Public Assembly is not for the primary purpose of
advertising any product, goods or event that is primarily for private profit,
and the Parade or Public Assembly itself is not primarily for profit. The
prohibition against advertising any product, goods or event shall not apply to
signs identifying organizations or sponsors furnishing or sponsoring exhibits
or structures used in the Parade or Public Assembly;

same time and location is already granted or has been received and will be
granted;
      (11)    No Parade, Festival or Public Assembly permit application for the
same time but different location is already granted or has been received and
will be granted, and the police resources required for that prior Parade,
Festival or Public Assembly are so great that in combination with the
subsequent proposed application, the resulting deployment of police services
would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of
persons and property; and
      (12)    No event is scheduled elsewhere in the Municipality where the
police resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of
police services for the proposed Parade or Public Assembly would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property.
   (b)    Prior to approving or denying a permit the Mayor, or his designee,
may require an applicant to attend a meeting to discuss matters affecting the
issuance of the permit. Failure to attend such meeting shall be grounds for

time, place and manner conditions, including but not limited to the hours, the
place of assembly and of dispersal, the location of participants or spectators
and vendors or booths, the route of access, permitted parking, and the portions
of Public Property which may be used or occupied.
   (d)    No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a street, sidewalk, or
right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the
structure is obtained.
   (e)    No permit shall be issued when it is determined that the application
contains any misrepresentation of material facts.
(Ord. 71-2000. Passed 3-27-00.)
   309.08 POLICE PROTECTION.
   (a)    The Chief of Police shall determine whether and to what extent
additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the Parade or Public
Assembly for traffic control and public safety. The Chief of Police shall base
this decision on the size, location, duration, time and date of the event, the
expected sale or service of alcoholic beverages, the number of streets and
intersections blocked, and the need to detour or preempt citizen travel and use
of the streets and sidewalks. The speech content of the event shall not be a
factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary. If additional
police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the Chief of Police, he
shall so inform the applicant for the permit. The applicant then shall have the
duty to secure the police protection deemed necessary by the Chief of Police at
the sole expense of the applicant.
   (b)    Persons engaging in Parades or Public Assemblies conducted for the
sole purpose of public issue speech protected under the First Amendment are not

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has

or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

notify the Director of Public Safety or his designated representative, in a
form provided, two weeks prior to the date of shipment. The form shall include
the date of shipment, type and quantity of radioactive materials involved,
method of transportation, route, starting point, destination and such other
information as the Director of Public Safety or his designated representative
may reasonably require. Any information which cannot be supplied two weeks
prior to shipment or transportation, shall be supplied promptly by the person
responsible for such shipment or transportation when such information becomes
available to him. Nothing herein shall be construed as data as defined in the

interests.
         B.   An "urgent public policy" shall not include interests other than
medical and educational interests, unless expressly authorized in writing by
the United States Department of Transportation, or by any other appropriate
federal or State agency which may be required by the Director of Public Safety
or his designated representative. Such authorization shall state that the
particular interest involved is, in the opinion of the agency, permitted by
federal or State regulations pertaining to the shipment or transportation of
radioactive materials, and that the interest involved justifies the apparent
risks resulting from such shipment or transportation.
   (b)   Radioactive materials which are permitted to be shipped or transferred
through the City pursuant to this chapter shall be shipped or transported
through the City over such route or routes, or at such time or times of the
day, consistent with the public health, safety and welfare and the convenience
of the shipper or carrier, as the Director of Public Safety or his designated
representative may direct.

   351.01 POWERS AND REGULATIONS OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY.
   (a)   In addition and subject to the specific provisions of this Traffic
Code relative thereto, the Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized to
promulgate regulations designating street areas wherein parking shall be
limited to specified periods of time, or there shall be no parking any time,
when in his judgment the public safety or welfare requires such limitation,
prohibition or permission. No such regulation shall permit parking in any place
specifically prohibited by this Traffic Code or by law. Such regulations shall
become effective upon delivery of a copy to the Chief of Police of the City,
and upon erection of signs sufficient in number to apprise the ordinarily
observant person of the existence of the regulation, and shall continue to have
the force and effect of ordinances until rescinded by the Director of Public
Safety or disapproved by ordinance of Council. Violation of any such regulation
shall be subject to the provisions and penalties provided and prescribed in
Section
351.99 .
(Ord. 247-1955. Passed 12-29-55.)
   (b)   The Director of Public Safety may prohibit the parking of all vehicles

such size and nature as to require the removal of vehicles from the streets in
the path of such procession, event or military funeral. Notice shall be posted
and order shall be issued prohibiting such parking for the reasons herein
stated at least three hours before such no-parking prohibition shall take
effect. Failure to comply with such parking ban shall constitute a violation of

that a vehicle bearing a certain license plate was found unlawfully parked as
prohibited by the provisions of this Traffic Code, and further testimony that
the record of the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles shows that the license plate
was issued to the defendant, shall be prima-facie evidence that the vehicle
which was unlawfully parked, was so parked by the defendant. A certified
registration copy, showing such fact, from the Registrar shall be proof of such
ownership.
   351.03 PROHIBITED STANDING OR PARKING PLACES.

the designated accessible parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally
entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under subsection (e) of this section, or
at accessible clearly marked parking locations provided in or on privately
owned parking lots, parking garages, or other parking areas and designated in
accordance with that division, unless one of the following applies:
            1.   The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of
a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a valid removable windshield placard or accessible license plates;
or
            2.   The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of
a person with a disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible
license plates.

location in violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section
may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and
pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for
towing and storing motor vehicles.
         C.   If a person is charged with a violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1.

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

   (a)   "Metered parking zones" means a portion of the paved surface of the
street, approximately twenty feet in length, extending from the sidewalk curb
to the street a sufficient distance to accommodate a vehicle when the same is
parked parallel to the curb in the same direction in which traffic legally
flows, with the wheels thereof not more than one foot from such curb, or a
portion of the paved surface of the street approximately ten feet in length and
extending from the sidewalk curb to the street a sufficient distance to
accommodate a vehicle when the same is parked at an angle to the curb, provided
there shall have been installed a parking meter upon the curb adjacent to such
designated space or in the immediate vicinity thereof.
   (b)   "Parking meter" means a device which shall indicate thereon the length
of time during which a vehicle may be parked in a metered parking zone and

street of sufficient length and depth from the sidewalk curb to accommodate a
vehicle to be parked, as shall be specified and marked off under the direction

   353.02 DESIGNATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARKING SPACES.
   The Safety Director is hereby authorized and directed to designate and mark
off or have marked off such individual parking spaces as he deems proper. At
each place where individual parking spaces are so marked off, each vehicle
shall be parked entirely within an individual parking space.
(Ord. 50-1948. Passed 8-18-48.)
   353.03 INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF PARKING METERS.
   The Safety Director is hereby authorized and directed to place, install and

Director.
(Ord. 50-1948. Passed 8-18-48.)
   353.04 REGULATION OF PARKING IN INDIVIDUAL PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   Whenever a vehicle shall be parked in an individual parking space
where a parking meter has been installed, the person parking such vehicle shall
make payment in such parking meter, if such meter displays the signal showing
that legal parking is only permitted on such deposit.
   
   (b)   The Safety Director, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, shall determine the length of time that parking is permitted in an
individual parking space for which a meter is installed, payment in the parking
meter as hereinbefore provided. Notice to the public shall be given by
appropriate signs setting forth the length of time for which parking is
permitted and conditions thereof. These may be upon the parking meter stand or
in the immediate vicinity. Any vehicle which remains in an individual parking
space after the prescribed time for parking is hereby determined to be

shows no parking permitted, unless payment is made as herein provided, shall be
deemed prima-facie evidence of the unlawful parking of such motor vehicle by
its operator or owner.

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a

501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13 RELEASE OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS.
   In addition to any existing provision of State or City law relating to the
arrest and detention of a juvenile offender, any minor charged with violating
any section of this General Offenses Code, shall be detained and released only

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.

only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

person having control of the real estate at his last known address to pay the
cost of such abatement. If payment of such costs are not received by the City

inspection of properties by City officials, and the cost of abating the
nuisance whether such abatement is performed by the City or by an independent

   For the purposes of this chapter, words and phrases shall have the following
meanings:
   (a)   "Admission Charge" shall mean the charge made for the right or
privilege to enter into a place, provided, however, that if such charge
includes rental of property or services it shall be deemed to be an admission
charge if so designated, unless the charge is for rental or services and
persons who do not use such property or services are admitted free. If a lesser
charge is made to the persons who do not desire to use the property or services
offered, the lesser charge shall constitute the admission charge. The
designation of the charge as a rental or service charge shall not be construed
to avoid the application of the tax if it is in effect a charge for admission.
Admission Charge shall not include a separate and identifiable component of a
charge paid exclusively for the use of property owned and maintained by any
organization or entity which would be eligible for an exclusion pursuant to the
provisions of Section
707.03 (a)-(f).
   (b)    "Tax Administrator" shall mean the Finance Director of the City of

amphitheatres, auditoriums, convention centers, exhibition centers, stadiums,
athletic pavilions and fields, baseball and athletic parks, circuses, side
shows, swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks, and such attractions as merry-
go-rounds, ferris wheels, dodge ems, roller coasters, and observation towers.
   (d)   "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm, co-
partnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company,
association, society, or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, co-operative, fraternal, non-profit or otherwise.
      (Ord. 105-1988. Passed 5-31-88.)
   707.02 LEVY.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon every person who pays an admission
charge to any place:
   (a)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the amounts paid for admission to any
place, including admission by season ticket or subscription. The tax shall
apply to every admission within the City of Cuyahoga Falls for which a charge
is made, notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right
of admission thereto is made outside of the City of Cuyahoga Falls.
   (b)    A tax of three percent (3%) on the amount paid for admission to any
public performance for profit on any roof garden, cabaret, or other similar
entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form of a service
charge or cover charge or other similar charge.
      (Ord. 105-1988. Passed 5-31-88.)
   707.03 ADMISSIONS EXEMPT FROM TAX.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission, all
the proceeds of which inure:
(Ord. 116-2006. Passed 11-27-06.)
   (a)    Exclusively to the benefit of primary or secondary school, religious,
educational or charitable institutions, societies or organizations; societies
or organizations for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals; or
societies or organizations conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining
symphony orchestras and receiving substantial support from voluntary
contributions, or of improving any municipal corporation, or of maintaining a
co-operative or community center moving picture theatre or swimming pool, if no
part of the net earnings thereof inures to the benefit of any private
stockholder or individual;
   (b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations, units or
societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no part of their net
earnings inure to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;
   (c)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the military
or naval forces of the United States and are in need;
   (d)    Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation, or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission. This
exemption from the tax, however, shall not be allowed in cases wherein the
admission price is one dollar ($1.00) or more;
   (e)    Exclusively to the benefit of an organization whose primary function
is the sponsorship of amateur athletics, provided such organization is exempt
from federal income taxation under subsection 501(a) and described in
subsection 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and further provided that
all revenue derived from the event for which admission is charged is, after
payment of expenses incurred for such event, is actually used for the
sponsorship of amateur athletics;
   (f)    Exclusively to the benefit of a political committee, campaign
committee, or continuing association, as such terms are defined by Section
3517.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, provided that all such proceeds are duly
reported in the manner required by Chapter 3517 of the Ohio Revised Code, and
further provided that none of the proceeds are expended in a manner prohibited
for such funds by any provision of Title 35 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (g)    To any person or organization, whether for profit or otherwise, where
the event for which a tuition fee is charged is an educational class, seminar,
training sessions, or other similar event, whether or not such event is
accompanied by any audio and/or visual aids;
   The exemption from tax provided by this Section shall, however, not be
allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights, or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or exhibitions, unless (1) such event is
conducted exclusively for the benefit of those organizations set forth in
subsection (b) hereof, or (2) all the contestants are amateurs and the entire
proceeds from such event are devoted to a legitimate charitable purpose,
excepting therefrom the necessary expenses, which shall in no event include
payment to any contestant other than his necessary traveling expenses.
   The term "all the proceeds" means all the proceeds of the admissions and
excess charges, as the case may be, after the payment of actual and reasonable
expenses. If a non- exempt person or organization furnishing talent or services
receives a percentage of the proceeds, without regard to the amount of such
proceeds, the exemption is defeated.
   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from admission tax has
been allowed, upon the demand of the Tax Administrator, the treasurer of the
institution, society, or organization for whose benefit such event was held
shall file an itemized statement with the Tax Administrator setting forth the
amount of money actually received by such treasurer together with the expenses
of promoting and conducting such event. Such statement shall be used as a basis
of subsequent requests for exemption from admissions tax for the benefit of
such institution, society or organization and if such statement shows a
disproportionate expenditure for promoting and conducting of such event, in
relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption shall thereafter be allowed
to such institution, society or organization.
   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall be determined on the
basis of each specific performance or event and shall not be allowed to any
institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis unless the contract or agreement limits the amount to be
received as percentage of the proceeds to a certain definite sum, and it is
clearly established that such sum is not in excess of the flat rate ordinarily
charged for the same talent, services or other items. There must be neither
actual nor potential profits for promoters, entertainers, or others than the
beneficiary in whose behalf the exemption is claimed.
(Ord. 105-1988. Passed 5-31-88.)
   707.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.

chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the

paid to the Tax Administrator as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Tax Administrator in
the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure be the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the City of Cuyahoga Falls for the amount
of such tax, and shall, unless the remittance be made as herein required, be
guilty of a violation of this Section. The tax imposed hereunder shall be

next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is collected or
received. Payment or remittance of the tax collection may be made by check,

liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Tax Administrator unless
the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person
receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms
and setting forth such information as the Tax Administrator may require,
showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the
preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the Tax
Administrator with a remittance for said amount, provided that the Tax
Administrator may in his discretion require verified annual returns from any
person receiving admission payments setting forth such additional information
as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of the tax collected
and payable. Whenever any theatre, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Tax
Administrator may require the report and remittance of the admission tax
immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of the
performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of performances
or exhibitions or at such other times as the Tax Administrator shall determine;
and failure to comply with any requirement of the Tax Administrator as to
report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
Section. The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Tax Administrator. If the tax
imposed by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added as part of
the tax interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month or fraction thereof
from the time when the tax became due until paid.

December of the year in which the same is issued. Such Certificate of
Registration or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued by the
Administrator without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous place
in each ticket or box office where tickets or admissions are sold.

operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
707.04  of this chapter by said owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the
person conducting the place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration
for such purpose shall furnish with the application therefor the name and
address of the owner, lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the
amusement is to be conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be
notified by the Administrator of the issuance of such Certificate and the joint
liability for collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 105-1988. Passed 5-31-88.)

not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing

   770.01 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   All provisions of this chapter shall apply to the heirs, executors or
assigns of any individual permittee, the successors and assigns of any firm,
partnership, association or corporate permittee, as fully as such provisions
apply to the original permittee. All references to oil and/or gas shall be
understood to include any other hydrocarbon products of such well drilling
operations.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.02 INTENT; AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   It is hereby expressly stated to be the intent of this chapter in
addition to prescribing minimum standards, to make drilling as safe as possible
within the City and to also cause drilling activities to be carried on within
the City in nonindustrial and industrially zoned areas, in accordance with Ohio
R. C. Chapter 1509.
   The City is aware of the difficulty in setting rigid rules as to the areas
to be included in any one unit. It is the intent of this chapter to have
property drilled, when reasonable and expedient in the City's judgment, on one
permit encompassing all appropriate and compatible properties and to prevent
the withholding of permission by a landowner for the sole purposes of later
requesting individual permission to drill on the same lot or area.
   (b)    The Planning Commission is herewith given full authority to make such
recom mendations as it shall deem necessary to give full force and effect to
the intent as expressed in subsection (a) hereof. Each application for a permit
shall rest solely upon its merits and the prudent use of discretion by the
Planning Commission.
   (c)    Council is herewith given final authority to impose such conditions
as it shall deem necessary to give full force and effect to the intent as
expressed in subsection (a) hereof. What is a proper case shall be within the
discretion of Council. Each application for a permit shall rest solely upon its
merits and the prudent use of discretion by Council.
   All references to oil and/or gas wells shall also include any other well
producing hydrocarbon production.
   (d)    Council may grant an exception to the provisions of this chapter upon
written request by the applicant and a two-thirds vote of Council.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.03 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, corporation or other entity shall commence to drill a well for
oil, gas or other hydrocarbons within the corporate limits of the City until
such time as such persons have wholly complied with all provisions of this
chapter and a conditional zoning certificate has been granted by Council to
such person for a period of one year.
   No person, corporation or other entity shall be permitted to drill more than
two wells at any one time. Application for the third permit, or any subsequent
permits, may be made upon completion of the drilling of the first, second and
each numerically subsequent well.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.04 PERMIT APPLICATION AND FEE.
   Any person, corporation or other entity desiring to drill a well for oil
and/or gas within the corporate limits of the City shall make application for a
conditional zoning certificate. All requests for permits shall be completed at
the time of such application. A fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be
paid at the time such application is filed. No refund of any part of a permit
fee shall be made to any permit holder for a dry hole or for failure to
exercise the privilege to drill upon the site covered by such permit.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.05 PUBLIC HEARING.
   Council shall require the applicant to schedule a public hearing on the
application, the date and time of which shall be approved by Council. The
permittee shall cause all property owners and residents within the City, or
neighboring municipalities, including the officials of neighboring
municipalities within 1,000 feet of the well head, to be notified of such
hearing, in writing, all by regular mail. Notice shall be given of such hearing
by publication in a newspaper of general circulation.
   The public meeting must occur not less than three weeks prior to the
commencement of drilling. The developer shall file a list of all addresses with
the City for all residents notified and shall thereon note the time, date and
place of the hearing.
   In addition thereto the developer shall cause a final notice to be published
by press release, or otherwise, one week prior to the actual drilling,
notifying residents of the day drilling operations shall commence.
   Compliance with the hearing provision of this chapter shall be a mandatory
condition precedent to the commencement of drilling under the permit. Should
improper notice have been given and drilling begun, drilling shall cease and
these hearing provisions complied with.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.06 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Any applicant, at the time of application, shall deposit with the City the
sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) to serve as a performance bond conditional
upon compliance with this chapter. Such bond shall not only be conditioned upon
compliance by the applicant, but also upon compliance with this chapter by any
assignee and owner of any permit granted hereunder, or any employee,
contractor, subcontractor or other party performing services in connection with
any permit issued hereunder. Bond shall be released upon completion of
landscaping, painting, fencing, cleanup, vital information signs and the
approval of the responsible City official or officials.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.07 DRILLING NEAR STRUCTURES; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    No drilling shall be permitted for oil and/or gas or other
hydrocarbon wells within 200 feet of industrial, commercial or residential
structures, mercantile buildings, or any school, public park, church, hospital,
theatre, assembly hall, library, public building or public streets as the same
are defined by the Ohio Revised Code, regardless of the zone. In the case of
particular installations where compliance with the foregoing distance
requirements may be a handicap to the use of the property and where no undue
hazard shall be created, the distance may be reduced at the discretion of
Council after due consideration of such special features as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the adjoining
property, proximity of storage tanks, degree of fire protection provided and
the facilities available at fire departments to cope with controlling liquid
fires. The above features are not to be in any way construed as a limitation of
matters which Council may consider. Council shall have the right to consider
any and all other special features it may consider important in determining
whether or not an undue hazard is created.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   (b)    In cases of undeveloped land, no structure shall be constructed
within one hundred feet of a producing, capped, plugged, improperly plugged,
abandoned, or improperly abandoned well except as provided in this chapter. A
copy of this chapter shall be recorded to provide such requirements in title
search proceedings.
(Ord. 157-1995. Passed 11-27-95.)
   770.08 CONSENTS FROM OWNERS WITHIN 500 FEET.
   (a)    All applications for a permit to drill for oil and/or gas in
nonindustrially and industrially zoned areas in the City shall be accompanied
by consents, in writing of the owners of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the
real estate which is located within a radius of 500 feet from a proposed
drilling site. The consents shall plainly state that the persons whose
signatures are affixed thereto do hereby given their consent to the drilling of
a well for oil and/or gas on the site as proposed in the application for a
drilling permit. Measurement for determination of the distance of the aforesaid
500 feet shall be made from the center of the location at which it is
contemplated the well shall be drilled.
   (b)    In the event that the owner of any property abutting a proposal well
site:
      (1)   Has leased his property for drilling for oil and/or gas; or
      (2)    Has signed and filed an application for a permit to drill for oil
and/or gas on his property, or his lessee, contractor or agent has signed and
filed such application; or
      (3)    Has signed and delivered a written assent under this chapter to an
application for a permit to drill a well for oil and/or gas; or
      (4)    Has utilized his property by entering into a community lease or
agreement for drilling a well for oil and/or gas, and if the well to which he
has assented or which is to be drilled under such community lease or agreement
is to be located nearer to his property than the well or proposed well site
first abovementioned in this subsection; then such owner shall not be permitted
to object, but shall be deemed to have given his written assent, under the
provisions of this section, to drilling a well for oil and/or gas on the
proposed well site first above-mentioned.
   However any owner who has united his property by entering into a community
lease or agreement as set forth in subsection (b)(4) hereof, shall not share in
any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of such
real estate caused by such real estate being in more than one unitized area. It
is the expressed intention of this provision to prohibit an owner of property
from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease or
agreement.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.09 WAIVERS FROM OWNERS OR OCCUPANTS WITHIN 200 OR 100 FEET. 
   (a)    In addition to the consents required in Section
770.07 , no drilling shall be permitted for oil and/or gas wells, in any zone
within 200 feet of any building or structure of any nature unless written
waivers as hereinafter provided for accompany an application for a drilling
permit.
   (b)    The owners or occupants of any buildings or structures which are
located within 200 feet of the proposed well site shall waive in writing the
distance set forth. Such owners or occupants may waive down to a minimum
distance of 100 feet without necessity of vacating, or causing to be vacated,
any buildings or structures during drilling operations.
   (c)    The owners or occupants of any buildings or structures of any nature
may consent to drilling for oil and/or gas closer than 100 feet to such
buildings or structures, but in such cases, the City shall consider special
features affecting the application for a drilling permit, such as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the abutting
property, facilities available at the Fire Department to cope with controlling
liquid fires and such other matters as the City shall deem relevant to the
application. Should the City upon considering such special features, find that
an undue hazard is created, then irrespective of waivers being provided as
called for in this subsection, the City may refuse to issue a permit to drill.
The denial of the permit and the undue hazard created shall be recorded in the
minutes of the Planning Commission and Council.
   (d)    Where the owners or occupants of any buildings or structures which
are closer than 200 feet to a proposed drilling site have, at any time waived
in writing the distance requirement provided in this section for any proposed
drilling site which was closer than 200 feet to such buildings or structures,
then such property owners shall be deemed to have waived the distance required
provided for in this section down to the same distance that such party waived
for the other proposed drilling site or to the distance that a well was
actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
   (e)    All distances as set forth in this section shall be those distances
as measured from the geographic center of a proposed well site.
(Ord. 98-1980. Passed 6-9-80.)
   770.10 PLOT PLAN AND VICINITY MAP REQUIRED.
   Each application for a drilling permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan

site;
   (b)    The lot lines of all abutting properties;
   (c)    The location of all buildings and structures within 500 feet of the
proposed well site;
   (d)    The location of all associated wells and appliances; that is the well
head, piping, tank batteries, access roads, drives, fences, gates, etc., shall
be shown on this map;
   (e)    A landscaping plan drawn to a reasonable scale as required unless
specifically waived by Council upon recommendation by the Planning Commission;
   (f)    The names of the owners of each property shown on the plot plan,
including well site parcel;
   (g)    A circle drawn on the plot plan at a radius of 100 feet, 200 feet and
500 feet from the proposed well site;
   (h)    A schematic of all pipelines, connections and shutoff valves for
emergency purposes. The schematic shall be modified and resubmitted to the City
for information purposes at any time that a change in either pipeline
locations, connections or shutoff valves occur;

five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) property damage and a minimum of one
million dollars ($1,000,000) personal injury, which insurance policy or
policies shall be maintained for such period of time as drilling is in
progress, the well is operational or is producing oil and/or gas, and until
such well is pulled and/or plugged as hereinafter provided. The insurance
policies and the coverage thereunder shall be to the complete satisfaction of
the City and such policies may be rejected by the City. Such rejection of the
insurance policies by the City shall serve to stay the granting of a permit
theretofore approved by it until such time as an insurance policy providing
coverage entirely satisfactory to the City has been provided by the applicant.
The applicant shall furnish proof of continuing paid up insurance premiums for
the duration of the well operation. Failure to do so shall be grounds to revoke
the permits previously granted.

   (b)    In the event the public walk or drive approach to be constructed,
replaced or repaired is part of an improvement program where the walks and

(Ord. 35-2007. Passed 3-12-07.)
   903.04 TEMPORARY SIDEWALKS AND WALKS NEAR NEW CONSTRUCTIONS.
   (a)    Where public walks are to be constructed or replaced in areas
adjacent to existing walks, other than as specified in Section
903.03(b), and where the grades at the extremities of the proposed construction
are greater than six inches above or six inches below the existing adjacent
walk grade, a permit shall be issued for the construction or replacement of the
public walk as a temporary construction or replacement, and the owner or his
agent shall sign an agreement to that effect. The agreement shall be attached
to and shall become a part of the permit, and a record of agreement shall be
maintained in the office of the City Engineer. The agreement signed by the
owner and notarized shall not relieve him of future assessments for the
construction of new walks required to meet the conditions resulting from a
future street improvement program in the area involved. Nothing in this section
shall prevent the owner or his agent from securing a permit for the
construction of temporary or contour sidewalks, which shall not be construed as
establishing the grade of any street.
   (b)    Where public sidewalks do not exist adjacent to property that is to
be improved by the construction of a residence, apartment, commercial or
industrial building for which a permit is required from the Department of
Building and Zoning Inspection, the owner or contractor of the proposed
construction shall not be granted a building permit until arrangements have
been made with the City Engineer for the installation, by the owner or
contractor, of public sidewalks along the street frontage of the property on
which the residence, apartment, commercial building or industrial building is
proposed to be erected, and until a certified check or acceptable collateral is
posted by the owner or contractor with the City Engineer in an amount equal to
the estimated cost of construction of the sidewalks. Such check or collateral
shall guarantee that the sidewalks shall be constructed by the owner or
contractor in accordance with the Specifications of the City.
   (c)    The City Engineer may, after examination of the location on which the
construction is proposed, waive the requirements, wholly or in part, of
subsection (b) hereof, if he is of the opinion that no useful purpose will be
served by constructing public walks at the time the construction for which the
building permit was issued is undertaken, by notifying the owner or contractor
of such action in writing.
   (d)   No action taken by the City Engineer, under the provisions of this
chapter, in regard to the omission of the construction of public walks during
the time of building construction for which a building permit was issued, shall
relieve the owner of the property of the responsibility for the installing of
public walks under this chapter at a future date when the need for public walks
is more apparent.

   921.01 PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   This chapter governs the provision of utility billing services,
including those for water, sewer, electric and sanitation and any other utility
services provided by the City, and all matters related to operation and
maintenance, including but not limited to the establishment, billing,
termination, disconnection, and re-connection of service, and any and all other
subjects as may be incident thereto. The Director of Public Service is hereby
authorized to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the provision of
utility services in accordance with this Chapter.
   (b)   As used in this chapter:
      (1)   "Premises" means any lot or other parcel of real property
recognized by the Summit County Fiscal Officer for tax or assessment purposes,
even if exempt from taxation, as well as any residential, commercial or
institutional units thereof that are separately metered for utility service.
      (2)   "Customer" means any person, corporation, or other entity that:
         A.   Has established an account with the City for the purpose of
purchasing any utility service, or
         B.   Is the Owner of any Premises served by a water and/or sewer
connection, or
         C.   Is in lawful possession of a Premises receiving any Utility
Service, by lease, rental agreement, decree of foreclosure, a will or probate
administration, power of attorney, receivership, or other means.
      (3)   "Utility Service" means any of the City's electric, water, sewer,
and sanitation services.
      (4)   "Owner" means the person, corporation or other entity whose name
appears on the Summit County tax duplicate as the owner of any Premises, and
any successor or transferee of such person, corporation or other entity.
      (5)   An Owner who is deemed a Customer at any Premises solely by
operation of subsection (b)(2)B. shall be deemed a Customer only with respect
to the water and sewer services used there.
         (Ord. 15-2012. Passed 2-13-12.)
   921.02 ESTABLISHING UTILITY SERVICE.
   (a)   Customers may establish a utility account with the City by application
providing such information as the City determines necessary, and paying the
appropriate deposit as provided herein. The City shall not provide a utility
account to any person who has a delinquent unpaid balance on any other utility
account with the City, unless the same is subject to an order of relief, or has
been discharged, in bankruptcy.
   (b)   Water and sewer accounts will be established and shall remain in the
name of the owner of the premises served thereby, and the owner of any premises
shall be and remain primarily liable for water and sewer charges incurred
there. However, water and sewer accounts may additionally be placed in the name
of a tenant or other customer who agrees to be secondarily liable for water and
sewer charges incurred at the premises served. Water and sewer bills may be
combined with other utility service bills in order to produce a single combined
bill to be provided to a tenant or other customer who is not the owner. The
combination of bills in this manner shall not affect the owner's primary
liability for water and sewer charges. Unless otherwise requested by the payor
at the time of payment, payments made on a combined bill will be apportioned to
the various utility account balances at the City's discretion. Utility
customers who are renting the premises to which utility services are to be
provided shall provide the City with a copy of a signed lease, rental
agreement, or other document, valid as of the date of the application, which
sets forth, as between landlord and tenant, their respective obligations to pay
utility bills. The City may require proof of ownership before creating an
account in the name of an owner.
   (c)   By establishing a utility account, the customer is deemed to agree to
all rules and regulations governing utility services and to pay all lawful
charges related to the furnishing of any City utility services to the
customer's premises.
(Ord. 15-2012. Passed 2-13-12.)
   921.03 DEPOSITS, SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, utility
customers shall pay the applicable deposits indicated in the following table
upon application for any utility service. Except as provided in subsections (b)
and (d) below, once a deposit has been placed on account for any utility
service at any Premises, no further deposit shall be required of that customer
for that account. Deposits will not earn interest.
 
Type of Premises                               Deposit
Residential Apartment                          $200.00

water meters less than 1")                     $1,000, but not less
                                               than $250.00
Commercial (Large/Distribution)                Lesser of 2
(all other commercial electric schedules;      Months
water meters 1" or greater)                    usage or $10,000
   (b)   Required deposits must be received by the Utility Billing Department
before new service or a new account will be established. Notwithstanding
subsection (a), but subject to subsection (d) below, the following conditions
shall apply to any request to establish new service, open new account, or re-
establish service after involuntary termination:
      (1)   A deposit will not be required of a bona fide owner-occupant of a
residential premises, unless the customer has twice been delinquent on a
utility account within the prior two years.
      (2)   A deposit will not be required of an Owner to secure water and
sewer accounts if a tenant or other customer has placed a deposit on the
account or is exempt from placing a deposit pursuant to subsection (b)(3)
below.
      (3)   A deposit will not be required of any prior customer whose
immediate past account history with the City is twenty-four (24) consecutive
bills each paid in full by the due date.
   (c)   Deposits will be held in trust for the customer's account and will be
applied to the account and/or refunded to the customer as follows:
      (1)   When all accounts held by a customer at a premises are voluntarily
closed, any deposit on those accounts will be applied to the final bill, and a
refund of any remaining balance will be paid to the depositing customer.
      (2)   When any utility service is involuntarily terminated, or the
Premises served by a delinquent account is vacant or abandoned, the customer's
accounts at that premises may be closed if the customer does not reestablish
service within fourteen (14) days of termination, or bring the account current
within fourteen (14) days' notice to do so. In that event a final bill shall be
prepared, any deposit on those accounts will be applied to the final bill, and
a refund of any remaining balance will be paid to the depositing customer.
      (3)   When a customer pays each of twenty-four (24) consecutive bills at
any premises in full by the due date, the customer's deposit on accounts at
that premises shall be refunded to the depositing customer.
      (4)   The accounts of a customer who becomes a petitioner in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court shall be closed, with final charges prorated as of the
petition date. Any deposit held on the accounts will be applied to any
outstanding pre-petition balances of that customer, and any remaining balance
will be paid to the depositing customer.
      (5)   Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1) through (4), a deposit placed by
an Owner solely to secure water and sewer accounts at a tenant-occupied
premises shall not be applied to settle outstanding balances on any account
except water and sewer accounts at that premises. A deposit placed by a tenant
or other customer shall not be applied to settle outstanding water and sewer
account balances unless there are no other outstanding account balances at that
premises and the tenant or other customer has previously agreed to be
responsible for water and sewer charges. Application of tenant deposits to
water and sewer charges does not affect the Owner's primary liability for water
and sewer charges that remain unpaid.
   (d)   Any new account opened by a bankrupt customer or a customer that has
been a petitioner in bankruptcy in the previous six (6) years shall be subject
to the deposit requirements of subsection (a) of this section, without regard
to the deposit waiver provisions of subsection (b). Charges on a new account
opened at the same location by the bankrupt customer shall be prorated forward
from the petition date. A bankrupt customer who does not open a new account and
pay a new deposit in accordance with this subsection within twenty (20) days of
the order for relief issued in the customer's bankruptcy case shall be subject
to termination of service.
   (e)   The following service charges shall apply to all customers:
SERVICE                                                                         CHARGE

requests a final reading, permanently closes the account, and physically

      (3)   Disconnection and reconnection fees shall be waived when, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Service, the request was made as a result of
a bona fide emergency such as fire, flood, or storm damage resulting from no
fault of the requesting customer.

has had an active utility account within the previous twenty-four (24) months,
or has made an application within the previous twenty-four (24) months.
         (Ord. 38-2019. Passed 6-10-19.)
   921.04 UNPAID CHARGES A LIEN ON THE PREMISES AS AUTHORIZED BY STATE LAW.
   (a)   The City hereby adopts as if fully rewritten herein any and all
provisions of the Ohio Revised Code providing for the levying of a lien upon
property for unpaid water and sewer utilities, as the same may be amended from
time to time. Except as otherwise provided herein, any such lien shall be
certified in accordance with the procedures provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Before certifying a lien to the County for non-payment of utilities,
the City shall first follow the termination procedures of Section
921.08, and apply any deposit to the unpaid balance. Upon application of a
deposit to an unpaid balance, utility service shall not be restored until the
payment of a new deposit. A person adversely affected by a lien may appeal the
lien to the Director of Finance, provided that such appeal shall be limited to
the questions of whether the utility bill is indeed delinquent and whether the
City followed all proper procedures in certifying the lien. Such appeal shall
be filed within 10 calendar days after service of a notice of the lien to the
property owner.
(Ord. 79-2007. Passed 6-18-07.)
   921.05 BUDGET PAYMENT SYSTEM.
   Customers of utility billing service who are not delinquent on any prior
utility bill or other payment agreement may utilize a budget billing payment
option. The City shall determine a reasonable average based on the most recent
twelve months of prior service. Customers participating in the budget billing
payment plan shall receive semi-annually a budget settle-up amount for actual
utility service usage. The budget billing payment option shall be terminated
for those customers who fail to make timely payments.
(Ord. 79-2007. Passed 6-18-07.)
   921.06 TERMINATION OF SERVICE, GENERALLY.

any of the following reasons:
   (a)   Non-payment of a bill; or

   921.07 TERMINATION FOR NONPAYMENT; COLLECTIONS.
   (a)   Utility service accounts will be considered delinquent and be subject
to the City's termination procedures for nonpayment, if for any given bill
containing a previous balance, full payment or arrangements for payment have

the termination procedures shall not be greater than that portion of the bill
that represents a previous balance, unless a payment arrangement is made in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Past due accounts shall be subject to collection and the City shall be
entitled to all remedies available under law.
   921.08 TERMINATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Residential Terminations.

of the premises not less than seven days, terminate the customer’s service
during normal City business hours in compliance with the following conditions:
         A.   The City shall provide the customer with written notice to the
customer’s address informing him that:
            1.   Sources of federal, state or local aid for payment of utility
bills may be available; and
            2.   A minimum payment plan may be entered into in the event the
customer establishes a present inability to pay the amount due in full; and
            3.   The City business address and telephone number of a City
representative in the event the customer has a dispute regarding the reasons
for termination.
         B.   No delinquent bill disconnections may be made after 12:30 p.m. on

and the City to perform re-connection of service are not regularly performed.
         C.   On the day and at the time of termination of service, the City
shall provide the customer with written notice to the dwelling where services
are to be terminated. In a multi-unit dwelling, written notice shall be placed
in a conspicuous place.
         D.   Termination of residential service for nonpayment may be delayed
when a customer notifies the City that termination of service would be
especially dangerous to health or would make operation of necessary medical or
life supporting equipment impossible or impracticable, so long as the customer
establishes an inability to pay the amount due and enters into and makes
payments in accordance with an extended payment plan.
   (b)   Commercial Termination (Non-residential).
      (1)   If the City determines that a commercial (non-residential) customer

shall provide the customer with written notice to the premises where services
are to be terminated. In premises with multi-units, written notice shall be
placed in a conspicuous place. Notices shall inform the customer that:
            1.   A minimum payment plan may be entered into in the event the
customer establishes a present inability to pay the amount due in full; and
            2.   The City business address and telephone number of a City
representative in the event the customer has a dispute regarding the reasons
for termination.
               (Ord. 79-2007. Passed 6-18-07.)
   921.09 PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   The City may allow customers to enter into a payment arrangement for
installment payments of delinquent accounts. Such agreement, if any, will be
based upon the amount of the delinquent account, length of time the balance has
been outstanding, the customer’s recent payment history, and the reasons why
payment has not been made. The City may make available the extended payment
plan to any customer not currently in default on a previously agreed upon
extended payment plan.
   (b)   A customer’s failure to make any payment provided in this section
shall entitle the City to terminate service in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this chapter.

by the City has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima-
facie evidence that the person in possession or control of the meter at the
time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter.
   (d)   As used in this section, “tamper” means to interfere with, damage, or
by-pass a utility meter in such a manner that impedes the correct registration
of a meter.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a third degree misdemeanor
and, in addition to any other penalty imposed by the Court, shall be fined not
less than two hundred dollar ($200.00).

utility service for lands outside the corporation limits shall submit to the
Planning Commission the complete plot and development plans for such land.

(Ord. 154-1967. Passed 10-9-67.)
   921.12 BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   (a)   If a customer has been overcharged for utility service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is discernible by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not discernable, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the
date of installation of the faulty meter or implementation of the error
resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or twenty-four months.
   (b)   If a customer has been undercharged for utility service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is discernible by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not discernable,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is the shortest of
the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the date of installation
of the faulty meter or implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge
(if applicable), or twenty-four months.
      (1)    Undercharges billed to residential customers shall in no event
exceed a period of twenty-four months. Customers shall have the option to pay
the amount undercharged in equal payments spread over the same number of months
as the charges were accumulated.
   (c)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer, its agent or a third
party causes inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or
no measurement of the utility rendered.
(Ord. 37-2019. Passed 6-10-19.)

(Ord. 100-1982. Passed 6-28-82.)
   923.06 BATH ROAD WATER LINE AREA CAPITAL COST SURCHARGE.
   The Director of Public Service is authorized and directed to require that
every person or business located in the Surcharge Area (as defined in Ordinance
No. 47 -1992, duly passed by City Council on April 13, 1992 and now on file in
the office of the Clerk of Council) and served or to be served by a connection
to the City's water system, shall pay, in addition to the other charges
provided in this Chapter (except the tap-in charge provided in Section
923.04(b)), the capital cost surcharge calculated by multiplying the Base
Surcharge, as set forth in the table below, by the number of capital surcharge
units assigned or anticipated to be assigned as of the date of connection to
the water system, determined as follows:
   (a)    Each single-family residential unit shall be assigned one capital
surcharge unit.
   (b)   A multi-family residential or nonresidential building, structure, or
other facility shall be assigned capital surcharge units or portions thereof to
the nearest one hundredth as is arrived at by dividing the assumed average
daily water usage for the structure by 400. Such daily water usage shall be
determined from the "Water Usage Suggested Guide" as set forth in the
publication entitled "Guidelines for Design of Small Public Water Systems"
published by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in 1988, which guide is
attached as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.
   (c)   A nonresidential building, structure or other facility, the daily
water usage of which is not set forth in "Water Usage Suggested Guide", shall
be assigned such number of capital surcharge benefits or portions thereof to
the nearest one- hundredth as determined by the Director of Public Service who
shall review the preliminary plans of the building, structure, or other
facility together with other pertinent information, and based upon accepted
engineering practices, determine the anticipated daily water usage to be
delivered to such building, structure, or other facility from the water system.
This quantity divided by 400 shall be the number of surcharge benefits units
assigned.
   The surcharge shall be in effect for all users located in the Surcharge Area
who have connected or connect to the City's water system, including all of
those users from properties formerly served by the Northampton Water Company.
The Base Surcharge shall be paid prior to connection to the water system, or on
or before June 1, 1992 for users already connected to the system as of the date
of Ordinance No. 47-1992, and shall be equal to the following amounts for each
calendar year in which a tap-in permit is obtained:
Year                       Base Surcharge
1992 (on or before June 1) $ 962.20
1992 (after June 1)        991.06
1993                       1,050.52
1994                       1,113.56
1995                       1,180.37
1996                       1,251.19
1997                       1,326.26
1998                       1,405.84
1999                       1,490.19
2000                       1,579.60
2001                       1,674.38
2002                       1,774.84
2003                       1,881.33
2004 (and thereafter)      1,994.21
   Any person planning to connect to the City's water system may pay the entire
surcharge amount in a year prior to connection equal to the amount that would
apply as if a tap-in permit had been obtained in the year of payment; provided,
however, if the use of the applicable property changes by the date of the
actual connection, the amount due will be adjusted. All users actually served
by a connection to the City's water system on or before December 31, 1994,
except those connecting to a newly-constructed facility, shall have an option
of paying the surcharge in 120 monthly installment payments, which payments
increase each calendar year. The installment payments to be made each calendar
year shall be calculated by dividing the lump sum surcharge which would apply
as if a connection had been made in the year the payment is due by 120. At any
time a user may determine to prepay the remaining installments due by paying an
amount calculated by dividing the number of remaining installment payments due
by 120 and multiplying the quotient by the applicable lump sum surcharge for
the year in which the prepayment is made.
   In the event a property owner moves before making all 120 payments, the new
owner of the property shall be responsible for all remaining surcharge payments
due under this Section. The owner of each property is responsible for the
payment of the surcharge in the event of failure of a tenant to make such
payment.
   In the event that within ten years following the payment of all or any
portion of a surcharge there is a substantial change in the usage of or
substantial development of any property or facility served by the connection to
the City's water system which does not result in a new connection to the City's
water system, the Director of Service shall determine in his discretion whether
a new surcharge or an additional surcharge amount shall be imposed.
   City Council may determine to modify the amount of the surcharge or to
discontinue the surcharge for connections to the City's water system made on or
after January 1, 2002.
   The tap-in service charge provided in Section
923.04(b) will be waived to the extent surcharge payments under this Section
have been paid.
(Ord. 47-1992. Passed 4-13-92.)
   923.07 THEISS/NORTHAMPTON ROAD WATER LINE AREA CAPITAL COST SURCHARGE.
   The Director of Public Service is authorized and directed to require that
every person or business located in the Surcharge Area (as defined in Ordinance
No.70-1994 duly passed by City Council on May 23, 1994 and now on file in the
office of the Clerk of Council) and served or to be served by a connection to
the City's water system, shall pay, in addition to the other charges provided
in this chapter (except the tap-in charge provided in Section
923.04(b) and the surcharge provided in Section
923.06), the capital cost surcharge calculated by multiplying the Base
Surcharge, as set forth in the table below, by the number of capital surcharge
units assigned or anticipated to be assigned as of the date of connection to
the water system, determined as follows:
   (a)    Each single-family residential unit shall be assigned one capital
surcharge unit.
   (b)    A multi-family residential or nonresidential building, structure, or
other facility shall be assigned capital surcharge units or portions thereof to
the nearest one- hundredth as is arrived at by dividing the assumed average
daily water usage for the structure by 400. Such daily water usage shall be
determined from the "Water Usage Suggested Guide" as set forth in the
publication entitled "Guidelines for Design of Small Public Water Systems”
published by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in 1988, which guide is
on file with the Clerk of Council and incorporated herein by reference.
   (c)    A nonresidential building, structure or other facility, the daily
water usage of which is not set forth in "Water Usage Suggested Guide", shall
be assigned such number of capital surcharge benefits or portions thereof to
the nearest one- hundredth as determined by the Director of Public Service who
shall review the preliminary plans of the building, structure, or other
facility together with other pertinent information, and based upon accepted
engineering practices, determine the anticipated daily water usage to be
delivered to such building, structure, or other facility from the water system.
This quantity divided by 400 shall be the number of surcharge benefits units
assigned.
   The surcharge shall be in effect for all users located in the Surcharge Area
who have connected or connect to the City's water system. The Base Surcharge
shall be paid prior to connection to the water system, or on or before December
31, 1994 for users already connected to the system as of the date of Ordinance
No. 70-1994 , and shall be equal to the following amounts for each calendar
year in which a tap-in permit is obtained:
Year                        Base Surcharge
1994 (on or before Dec. 31) $ 3,877.53
1995                        4,118.57
1996                        4,374.61
1997                        4,646.55
1998                        4,935.42
1999                        5,242.24

2002                        6,281.99
2003                        6,672.55
2004                        7,087.39
2005                        7,528.02
2006 and thereafter         7,996.05
   Any person planning to connect to the City's water system may pay the entire
surcharge amount in a year prior to connection equal to the amount that would
apply as if a tap-in permit had been obtained in the year of payment; provided,
however, if the use of the applicable property changes by the date of the
actual connection, the amount due will be adjusted. All users actually served
by a connection to the City's water system on or before December 31, 1995,
except those connecting to a newly-constructed facility, shall have an option

increase each calendar year. The installment payments to be made each calendar
year shall be calculated by dividing the lump sum surcharge which would apply
as if a connection had been made in the year the payment is due by 120. At any
time a user may determine to prepay the remaining installments due by paying an
amount calculated by dividing the remaining installment payments due by 120 and
multiplying the quotient by the applicable lump sum surcharge for the year in
which the prepayment is made.
   In the event a property owner moves before making all 120 payments, the new
owner of the property shall be responsible for all remaining surcharge payments
due under this Section. The owner of each property is responsible for the
payment of the surcharge in the event of failure of a tenant to make such
payment.
   In the event that within ten years following the payment of all or any
portion of a surcharge there is a substantial change in the usage of or
substantial development of any property or facility served by the connection to
the City's water system which does not result in a new connection to the City's
water system, the Director of Service shall determine in his discretion whether
a new surcharge or an additional surcharge amount shall be imposed.
   City Council may determine to modify the amount of the surcharge or to
discontinue the surcharge for connections to the City's water system made on or
after January 2, 2005.
The tap-in service charge provided in Sections
923.04(b) and
923.06 will be waived to the extent surcharge payments under this Section
having been paid.

   The Director of Public service is authorized and directed to require that
every person or business located in the Surcharge Area (as defined in Ordinance
No. 37-1995 duly passed by City Council on March 27, 1995 and now on file in
the office of the Clerk of Council) and served or to be served by a connection
to the City’s water system, shall pay, in addition to the other charges
provided in this chapter except the tap-in charge provided in Section
923.04(b) and the surcharge provided in Section
923.06 and

Surcharge, as set forth in the table below, by the number of capital surcharge
units assigned or anticipated to be assigned as of the date of connection to
the water system, determined as follows:
   (a)    Each single-family residential unit shall be assigned one capital
surcharge unit.
   (b)   A multi-family residential or nonresidential building, structure, or
other facility shall be assigned capital surcharge units or portions thereof to
the nearest one- hundredth as is arrived at by dividing the assumed average
daily water usage for the structure by 400. Such daily water usage shall be
determined from the “Water Usage Suggested Guide” as set forth in the
publication entitled “Guidelines for Design of Small Public Water Systems”
published by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in 1988, which guide is
on file with the Clerk of Council and incorporated herein by reference.
   (c)   A nonresidential building, structure or other facility, the daily
water usage of which is not set forth in “Water Usage Suggested Guide”, shall
be assigned such number of capital surcharge benefits or portions thereof to
the nearest one- hundredth as determined by the Director of Public Service who
shall review the preliminary plans of the building, structure, or other
facility together with other pertinent information, and based upon accepted
engineering practices, determine the anticipated daily water usage to be
delivered to such building, structure, or other facility from the water system.

   Any person planning to connect to the City's water system may pay the entire
surcharge amount in a year prior to connection equal to the amount that would
apply as if a tap-in permit had been obtained in the year of payment; provided,
however, if the use of the applicable property changes by the date of the
actual connection, the amount due will be adjusted. All users actually served
by a connection to the City's water system on or before December 31, 1996,
except those connecting to a newly-constructed facility, shall have an option
of paying the surcharge in 120 monthly installment payments, which payments
increase each calendar year. The installment payments to be made each calendar
year shall be calculated by dividing the lump sum surcharge which would apply
as if a connection had been made in the year the payment is due by 120. At any
time a user may determine to prepay the remaining installments due by paying an
amount calculated by dividing the remaining installment payments due by 120 and
multiplying the quotient by the applicable lump sum surcharge for the year in
which the prepayment is made.
   In the event a property owner moves before making all 120 payments, the new
owner of the property shall be responsible for all remaining surcharge payments
due under this Section. The owner of each property is responsible for the
payment of the surcharge in the event of failure of a tenant to make such
payment.
   In the event that within ten years following the payment of all or any
portion of a surcharge there is a substantial change in the usage of or
substantial development of any property or facility served by the connection to
the City's water system which does not result in a new connection to the City's
water system, the Director of Service shall determine in his discretion whether
a new surcharge or an additional surcharge amount shall be imposed.
   City Council may determine to modify the amount of the surcharge or to
discontinue the surcharge for connections to the City's water system made on or
after January 2, 2006.
   The tap-in service charge provided in Sections
923.04(b) and the surcharges provided in
923.06 and
923.07 will be waived to the extent surcharge payments under this section
having been paid.

   Any person planning to connect to the City's water system may pay the entire
surcharge amount in a year prior to connection equal to the amount that would
apply as if a tap-in permit had been obtained in the year of payment; provided,
however, if the use of the applicable property changes by the date of the

which the prepayment is made.
   In the event a property owner moves before making all 120 payments, the new
owner of the property shall be responsible for all remaining surcharge payments
due under this Section. The owner of each property is responsible for the
payment of the surcharge in the event of failure of a tenant to make such
payment.
   In the event that within ten years following the payment of all or any

   (a)    The Director of Public Service is authorized and directed to require
that every person or business located in the Surcharge Areas as defined in
Ordinance No. 60-1996 duly passed by City Council on April 22, 1996 and now on
file in the office of the Clerk of Council and served or to be served by a
connection to the City's water system, shall pay, in addition to the other
charges provided in this Chapter the capital cost surcharges calculated as
follows:
      (1)    The Lump Sum Surcharge Amount shall be calculated by multiplying
the Base Surcharge, as set forth in the table below, by the number of capital
surcharge units assigned or anticipated to be assigned as of the date of
connection to the water system, determined as follows:
         A.   Each single-family residential unit shall be assigned one capital
surcharge unit.
         B.   A multi-family residential or nonresidential building, structure,
or other facility shall be assigned capital surcharge units or portions thereof
to the nearest one-hundredth as is arrived at by dividing the assumed average
daily water usage for the structure by 400. Such daily water usage shall be
determined from the "Water Usage Suggested Guide" as set forth in the
publication entitled "Guidelines for Design of Small Public Water Systems"
published by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in 1988, which guide is
on file with the Clerk of Council and incorporated herein by reference.
         C.   A nonresidential building, structure or other facility, the daily
water usage of which is not set forth in "Water Usage Suggested Guide", shall
be assigned such number of capital surcharge benefits or portions thereof to
the nearest one-hundredth as determined by the Director of Public Service who
shall review the preliminary plans of the building, structure, or other
facility together with other pertinent information, and based upon accepted
engineering practices, determine the anticipated daily water usage to be
delivered to such building, structure, or other facility from the water system.
This quantity divided by 400 shall be the number of surcharge benefits units
assigned.
            The Lump Sum Surcharge Amount shall be in effect for and apply to
all users located in the Lump Sum Surcharge Area depicted in Exhibit A, other
than users on property which has been assessed for the water lines to which
they connect, who connect to the City's water system on or after May 1,1996.
For purposes of the Lump Sum Surcharge Amount but not for purposes of the High
Pressure Service Charge Amount, any user who was served by a connection to the
County water system prior to May 1,1996, shall be deemed to have connected to
the City's water system prior to May 1,1996. The Lump Sum Surcharge Amount
shall be paid by all such users in the Lump Sum Surcharge Area depicted in
Exhibit A who connect to the City's water system on or after May 1,1996, prior
to connection to the water system, and said Surcharge Amount shall be equal to
the following amounts for each calendar year in which a tap-in permit is
obtained:
Year Base Surcharge
1996 $ 2,500.00
1997 2,650.00
1998 2,809.00
1999 2,977.54

2004 3,984.62
2005 4,223.70
2006 4,477.12
            Any person planning to connect to the City's water system may pay
the entire Lump Sum Surcharge Amount in a year prior to connection equal to the
amount that would apply as if a tap-in permit had been obtained in the year of
payment, provided, however, if the use of the applicable property changes by
the date of the actual connection, the amount due will be adjusted. All users
actually served by a correction to the City's water system within eighteen (18)
months of the date upon which the City Engineer and the Water Superintendent
certify that the waterline serving that user is completed, except those
connecting to a newly-constructed facility, shall have an option of paying the
surcharge in 120 monthly installment payments, which payments increase each
calendar year. The installment payments to be made each calendar year shall be
calculated by dividing the lump sum surcharge which would apply as if a
connection had been made in the year the payment is due by 120. At any time a
user may determine to prepay the remaining installments due by paying an amount
calculated by dividing the remaining installment payments due by 120 and
multiplying the quotient by the applicable lump sum surcharge for the year in
which the prepayment is made.
            In the event a property owner moves before making all 120 payments,
the new owner of the property shall be responsible for all remaining surcharge
payments due under this Section. The owner of each property is responsible for
the payment of the surcharge in the event of failure of a tenant to make such
payment.
            In the event that within ten years following the payment of all or
any portion of a surcharge there is a substantial change in the usage of or
substantial development of any property or facility served by the connection to
the City's water system which does not result in a new connection to the City's
water system, the Director of Service shall determine in his discretion whether
a new surcharge or an additional surcharge amount shall be imposed.
      (2)    In addition to any other charges there shall also be charged to
each user located in the High Pressure Service Charge Area depicted in Exhibit
B and connected to the City's water system, except customers of the Cuyahoga
Falls Water Utility who obtained Cuyahoga Falls Water service prior to May I,
1996, a High Pressure Service Charge Amount as follows:
 
First 400 cubic feet. per month - Minimum $6.88 per month
All Over 400 cubic feet                   $17.21 per 1000 cubic feet
per month
      (3)   The High Pressure Service Charge imposed pursuant to subsection (a)
(2) above shall terminate effective December 1, 2013.
   (b)    Upon completion of construction of all waterlines and facilities
necessary to serve the Northeast High Pressure Water District, and at five year
intervals thereafter, City Council shall evaluate the costs of construction,
the revenue being generated, and the projected development within the District
and may determine to modify the amount of either surcharge, to extend the time
for payment of either surcharge, or to discontinue either surcharge as Council
determines to be appropriate to accomplish the equitable reimbursement of the
City's actual costs of the improvements in the Surcharge Areas as set out
herein.
   (c)    The tap-in service charge provided in Sections
923.04(b) and the surcharges provided in
923.06,
923.07,
923.08, 
923.09 and

   927.01 DOWNSPOUT AND DRAIN CONNECTIONS, OPEN GUTTER AND CESSPOOL
CONNECTIONS, STORM WATER PROHIBITED, NUISANCE CONDITIONS ABATED.
   (a)   The discharge of storm water by any means whatsoever into the City’s
sanitary sewer system is hereby declared to be a nuisance.
   (b)   No person shall connect any downspout of any building, any subsoil
drain, any storm water connection, or the waste drain of any hydrant or water
plug, or any open gutter, cesspool or privy vault, either directly or
indirectly, to any sanitary sewer, or permit any storm water to be in any
manner discharged into such sewer. No person shall permit any sanitary sewer
lateral located on land owned by the person to remain in a state that permits
the infiltration of storm water into the sanitary sewer lateral.
   (c)   The owner or person in control of real property shall:
      (1)   Cause the disconnection from the sanitary sewer system of any
downspout of any building, any subsoil drain, any storm water connection, or
the waste drain of any hydrant or water plug, or any open gutter, cesspool or
privy vault, located on the real property.
      (2)   Repair any sanitary sewer lateral located on the real property to
prevent the infiltration of storm water into the sanitary sewer lateral.
      (3)   Remove and/or correct any condition upon the real property that
permits the infiltration or inflow of storm water into the City’s sanitary
sewer system.
   (d)   If the owner or person in control of real property fails to take the
remedial actions provided for in subsection (c) above, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the Director of Public Service may cause written
notice to be served on the owner of the real estate or person having control of
the real estate. The notice shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, the
Director’s estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by the City, the
statement that the owner or person having control of the real estate shall
abate the nuisance within 180 days of the date of the letter, and the statement
that, unless the nuisance is abated within the said time, it may be abated by
the City and the cost of abatement assessed on the real estate involved. The
notice may be served by delivering it personally to the owner or person having
control of the real estate or leaving it at his usual place of business or
residence, or by mailing it to the owner or person having control of the real
estate, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved, or
by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City if
it cannot be served in any of the other ways above mentioned. A record shall be
kept in the office of the Director of Public Service showing the date of
service, the person served, and the manner of service. When service is by mail,
the date of service shall be deemed to be the date of mailing of the notice and
the person served shall be deemed to be the person to whom the notice is
addressed. In the event the owner or person having control of the real estate
does not abate the nuisance within 180 days of service of the notice to do so
the Director of Public Service is hereby authorized to cause the abatement of
the nuisance under the terms of this ordinance. Any person receiving the notice
provided for herein may file an appeal with the Board of Building Appeals
pursuant to procedures established in and pursuant to Chapter
1307 of the Codified Ordinances. All enforcement action will be tolled pending
the outcome of any such appeal.
   (e)   The owner of real property, whether or not ordered to do so by the
City, may request that the City abate any nuisance as defined in subsection (c)
above under the terms of this Section. Work performed by the City under this
section shall not include work the primary purpose of which is to prevent water
infiltration into a person’s dwelling, basement, cellar, or crawl space.
   (f)   Whenever any nuisance is abated by the City pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, whether pursuant to order of the Director of Public Service or
the request of the owner, the City shall assess the costs of such abatement to
the owner or person having control of the real estate upon which the nuisance
was abated. A notice of such assessment shall be sent by regular mail to the
owner or person having control of the real estate at his last known address to
pay the cost of such abatement. If payment of such costs is not received by the
City within thirty days after the mailing of such notice, then the amount shall
be certified to the County Fiscal Officer for collection the same as other
taxes and assessments are collected. The cost of abatement shall be the actual
cost of the City of the abatement, whether such abatement is performed by City
employees or by an independent contractor, but said cost shall not include the
cost of any services performed on City-owned infrastructure, or the cost of
services performed on any infrastructure located within City owned property or
street rights of way. Costs for services of City employees shall include,
without limitation, an amount based on the hourly rate of pay, including all
fringe benefits, of the personnel involved. Any amount certified to the County
Fiscal Officer shall be paid over the following time periods, with interest
charged at a rate that the City can obtain at the time of the assessment:
 
Cost of abatement up to $1,500.00 5 years
Cost of abatement over $1,500.00  10 years
   Within fifteen days after receipt of the notice of the assessment, a person
may apply in writing to City Council asking that the assessment be deferred on
the basis of a financial hardship. City Council will hear the request and
determine whether to grant the request and, if the request is granted, under
what terms.

         B.   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Cuyahoga Falls as
being necessary to protect public health and safety.
         C.   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Summit County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Summit
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are
deemed to be creating a public health nuisance by the Summit County Board of
Health. Discharges from new or replacement off-lot household sewage treatment
systems installed after January 1, 2007 are not exempt from the requirements of
this regulation.
In compliance with The City of Cuyahoga Falls Storm Water Management Program,

issued and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such
permit coverage is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007,
discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing
prior to January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
      (2)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is

connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
         B.   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if
the person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue.
   (h)   Monitoring of Illicit Discharges and Illegal Connections.
      (1)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The City of Cuyahoga Falls shall establish a program to
detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.
This program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
      (2)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
         A.   The City of Cuyahoga Falls shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this regulation.
         B.   The City of Cuyahoga Falls shall have the right to set up at
facilities subject to this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as
determined by The City of Cuyahoga Falls.
         C.   The City of Cuyahoga Falls shall have the right to require the
facility owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and
proper operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/
operator's expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality
shall be calibrated by the City of Cuyahoga Falls to ensure their accuracy.
         D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Cuyahoga Falls and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the facility owner/operator.
         E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing The City of Cuyahoga Falls access
to a facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
         F.   If The City of Cuyahoga Falls is refused access to any part of
the facility from which storm water is discharged, and The City of Cuyahoga
Falls demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, The City of Cuyahoga Falls may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
         G.   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
   (i)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Notice of Violation. When the Director of Public Service finds that
a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
regulation, the Director may order compliance by written Notice of Violation
(NOV). Such notice must specify the violation and shall be hand delivered, and/
or sent by registered mail, to the owner/operator/person in control of the real
property of the facility where the violation occurred. Such notice may require
the following actions:
         A.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
         B.   The elimination of illicit discharges or illegal connections;
         C.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations cease and
desist;
         D.   Where an illicit discharge has damaged, contaminated or fouled
any portion of the storm sewer system or any public property, facility or
watercourse, the NOV may additionally require the violator to conduct or pay
for the clean-up or remediation of the storm sewer system, property, facility
or watercourse, to the satisfaction of the Director;
         E.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
         F.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
      (2)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
is required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which
such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further
advise that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be
initiated. This deadline shall not exceed thirty (30) days from NOV. Reasonable
extensions of time to abate may be granted by the Director where cessation of
the discharge of removal of the illegal connection requires construction of
sewers, control facilities or process modification that cannot be completed
within thirty (30) days.
      (3)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
      (4)   Appeals: Any person aggrieved by a decision made by the City
Engineer, the Director of Public Service, or their designees under Chapter
929  may file an appeal with the Board of Building Appeals ("Board") within
thirty (30) days after the decision. The Board shall have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse or modify any such decision pursuant to its jurisdiction under
Section
 1307.04  of these Codified Ordinances. The filing of an appeal does not by
itself suspend or nullify any order made and in effect, and does not authorize
any work that would otherwise be unauthorized or unpermitted.
      (5)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of Cuyahoga
Falls may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
owner/operator from activities that would create further violations or
compelling the owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
      (6)   Penalties. Whoever knowingly violates any provision of this Section
929.03  contrary to the NOV and orders to abate shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred
dollars ($200.00). Each day such violation continues shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   (j)   Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this regulation are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state

(Ord. 23-2024. Passed 2-26-24.)
   945.07 INTERMENT RIGHTS OF PLOT OR NICHE OWNERS.
   (a) No body or remains except that of a human being may be interred or
inurned in the cemetery.
   (b)    With the written approval of the owner of record, or in the case of
multiple ownership, of any co-owner, of a plot or niche, any person may be
interred in such plot or niche. The Director of Public Service shall be
entitled to rely on the written approval of one co- owner. Written approval
must be in the form of a notarized affidavit and must be submitted to the
Director of Public Service. Such written approval will automatically expire
upon the submittal of a subsequent affidavit by the same owner or upon the
owner's death, or upon submittal of affidavits of a majority of co-owners,
provided the City has not already acted in reliance of the first affidavit.
   (c)    Notice to the City of the grave assignment must be made by the record
owner at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the burial. If no assignment is
made within that period of time, the City will designate the grave assignment.
   (d)    When a person is to be interred upon a plot or in a niche, the
aforesaid written approval may be omitted by the Director of Public Service if
he is satisfied that such person is related to the owner, or to a co-owner or
to a person then interred upon such plot or niche, as a:
      (1)    Spouse;
      (2)    Lineal descendent or lineal ancestor; or
      (3)    Brother or sister.
   (e)    When the owner of record of a plot or niche is deceased and no action
has been taken to transfer ownership on the cemetery records to a living person
or persons, or when there is no known living person upon whom ownership may
devolve, the Cemetery Division, with the approval of the Director of Public
Service, may consent to the interment thereon of a deceased person as to whom
there is reasonable ground to believe that such person would be entitled to be
an owner or co-owner by devolution of title from the last owner of record under
the statutes of descent and distribution of the State in effect at the time of
such interment.
   (f)    When a death occurs, and it is desired that the decedent be interred
in the cemetery, very little time is available to the Director of Public
Service for research into the relationship of the decedent to the owner or co-
owner or to a person then interred upon a plot or niche. Many plots in the
cemetery have a record owner or owners who are long deceased, and for which
there is no record or information of the names or addresses of living persons
who would be entitled to record ownership under Section
945.15. In such situations, it is the policy of the City to construe this
section liberally, so that the requested interment may proceed without
protracted research or to the embarrassment of relatives and friends.
(Ord. 119-1996. Passed 9-9-96.)
   945.08 REPURCHASE OF PLOTS OR NICHES BY CITY; CONVEYANCE TO OTHERS
PROHIBITED.
   (a)    If the owner of a plot or niche moves his residence from the City
permanently or has a reason otherwise acceptable to the Director of Public
Service, the City may buy back a plot or niche at fifty percent (50%) of the
current resident rate. In the case of a resident permanently removing his
residence from the City the resale provisions shall be waived by the Director
if the grave owner so desires and the plot or niche retained by the owner upon
application to the Office of the Director where the owner deems it appropriate.
   (b)    The plot or niche owner is restricted from conveying any and all
plots and/or niches he owns to any other person, association, or corporation
whatsoever other than the City, except as provided in Section
945.15.
(Ord. 119-1996. Passed 9-9-96.)

vaults that are constructed from other than concrete or steel. The Director of

the veteran's burial, only spousal cremains shall be added to a plot with a

may be added to a plot.

Building and Grounds Maintenance Superintendent, or their designee, and sign an
agreement with the City stating that the veteran will use the plot upon his or
her death and specifying whether the veteran wishes to be cremated. Upon the
burial of the spouse, one marker shall be erected for the plot, in uniformity
with those preexisting, naming the spouse on the back of the marker and naming
the veteran with his or her date of death left blank on the front of the
marker. Upon the death of the veteran, he or she shall be buried in the

Way. If the City abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,

   (h)   Nature of Issuance.  A Certificate of Registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the Rights-of-Way. A Certificate of Registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Rights-of-Way in the City, for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the Certificate of
Registration and in accordance with this chapter. The rights to occupy the
Right-of-Way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two
(2) or more Providers may locate Facilities in the same area of the Rights-of-
Way so long as each such Provider complies with the provisions of this chapter.
Such Providers may file a joint application for a Construction Permit. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its
Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City's Facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in
or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying with any
provisions of the Code or other applicable law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a Certificate
of Registration, Providers shall obtain all regulatory approvals, permits,
authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of such
Services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and upon the
City's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents to the City.
Further, a Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
Facilities, Small Cell Facilities, Wireless Facilities, Wireless Support
Structures, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable
or any other real or personal property of any kind under the management or
control of the City.

any way altering any street or area in the Rights-of-Way as defined in this
chapter. The City shall notify the Providers of the City's date to begin the
process at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of said activities.
In field identifying Facilities:

otherwise agreed upon by the Director of Public Service or designee, the City
or its contractor may transfer all remaining lines or cables to the replacement

conflict with an actual or proposed public improvement project. The above
requirements may be waived by the Director of Public Service for good cause
shown including, but not limited to, consideration of such factors as: the
remaining economic life of the Facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, law precluding such Underground Facilities, and hardship to the

requirements, the Provider may appeal the denial of the Director of Public
Service to the Mayor. The decision of the Mayor shall be final.

underground within a certain area of the City, every Provider with Facilities
within the same area of the City shall concurrently re-locate their Facilities
underground, to the fullest extent possible.
         C.   The above requirements may be waived by the Director of Public
Service for good cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of
such factors as: the remaining economic life of the Facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, law precluding such undergrounding of facilities, and
hardship to the Provider. If a Provider is denied a requested waiver from the
above requirements, the Provider may appeal the denial of the Director of
Public Service to the Mayor.
   (g)   Historic Districts.
      (1)   Unless otherwise required by law, the City shall have the authority

   951.06 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each Provider shall, at the
time of initial Application and using its Best Efforts by January 1 of each
following year, file a Construction and Major Maintenance Plan with the
Department of Public Service. Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan
shall be provided for all geographical areas requested by the Director of
Public Service, up to and including the entire geographical area of the City.
It shall be submitted using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the Provider and
the City and shall contain the information determined by the Director of Public
Service to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the
frequency of Construction in the Rights-of-Way. The Construction and Major
Maintenance Plan shall include, but not be limited to, all currently scheduled
and/or anticipated Construction projects for the next calendar year. If none of
such Construction projects are scheduled or anticipated for the next calendar
year then the Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall so state. The
Provider shall use its Best Efforts in supplying this information and shall
update the Construction and Major Maintenance Plan on file with the Director of
Public Service whenever there is a material change in scheduled and/or
anticipated Construction projects. In an effort to assist Providers with the
completion of their annual Construction and Major Maintenance Plan, the
Director of Public Service, on or before November 1 of each year, will send
each Provider's System Representative a descriptive narrative (and any mapping
information reasonably available) for all the planned Right-of-Way improvements
and/or scheduled maintenance that the City then currently intends to undertake
during the next calendar year. The City may, in its sole discretion, update
and/or modify the descriptive narrative and mapping information provided.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its Application for a Certificate of
Registration, a Provider shall be required to accurately inform the City of the
number of miles of physical infrastructure (rounded up to the nearest mile) of
Right-of-Way the Provider's System then currently occupies and begin submitting
to the City all information that currently exists and which can be provided
regarding the location of its Facilities in the Right-of-Way in hard copy or in
the most advanced format (including, but not limited to, electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the Provider that is then
currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a
readable form) by the City. A Provider shall have up to one (1) year from the
date of the Provider's initial filing of an Application for a Certificate of
Registration to completely submit all the mapping data for the System owned by
the Provider or over which it has control that is located in any Rights-of-Way
of the City in the most advanced format (including, but not be limited to
electronic and/or digital format) then currently being used by the Provider
that is then currently capable of technologically being read (or readily
converted to a readable form) by the City. The mapping data is only required to
be at the "Atlas" level of detail necessary for the City to reasonably
determine the location of the Provider's facilities in the Rights-of-Way. The
Provider shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Director of Public
Service determines that the format currently being used by the Provider is not
capable of being read by the City. Any time after the issuance of a Certificate
of Registration, and upon the reasonable request of the Director of Public
Service, a Provider shall be required to provide to the City any additional
location information for any Facilities which it owns or over which it has
control that are located in any Rights-of-Way of the City required by the City.
Unless otherwise required by Law, any and all actual direct, incidental and
indirect costs incurred by the City during the process of reviewing, inputting
and/or converting a Provider's mapping information to comport with the City's
then current standard format (whether electronic or otherwise) shall be
directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the Provider. Failure to
pay such mapping costs within sixty (60) days of receipt of an invoice shall
subject an Applicant or Provider to revocation of its Certificate of
Registration and the penalties of §
 951.99 . Further, each Provider that has been issued a Certificate of
Registration shall accurately inform the City on or before each subsequent
January 1 of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right-of-
Way the Provider's System then occupied as of the immediately previous December
1. The Director of Public Service may, in the future, adopt additional
specifications and further define or modify the mapping data requirements under
this section for reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology
or the law regarding public disclosure of a Provider's mapping information.
When the City modifies and/or amends the mapping data requirements, the City
shall use Best Efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the
Providers that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping
requirements. If the mapping requirements of this Section
951.06 (b) are amended, each Provider shall be served with a copy of the new
specifications or modifications by regular U.S. Mail to the System
Representative identified in each Certificate of Registration; provided,
however, that any failure of any Provider to actually receive such notice shall
not in any way affect the validity or enforceability of said specifications or
modifications.

      (1)   The City by February 28 of each year shall calculate all actual and
incurred costs associated with Rights-of-Way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the City was not able to reasonably
recover through Construction Permit Fees or other recovery mechanisms provided
for in this chapter.
      (2)    Providers and Applicants, as required in Section
951.06( b), shall accurately inform the City upon application for a Certificate
of Registration and on or before each subsequent January 1 of the number of
miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right-of-Way the Provider's System
then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1.
      (3)    The City shall total the entire number of miles of Right-of-Way
reported as being used or occupied by all Providers.
      (4)    The City shall divide the calculated costs referenced in Section
951.07 (a)(1) by the total number of miles of Right-of-Way reported as being
used or occupied by all Providers as referenced in Section
951.07( a)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)    The City shall then multiply each Provider's mileage calculation
as referenced in Section
951.07 (a)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in Section
 951.07 (a)(4). The product shall be a Provider's then current annual
Registration Maintenance Fee.
      (6)    The City shall perform its annual calculation of Registration
Maintenance Fees following receipt of the Provider's required January 1 mileage
report. Registration Maintenance Fees shall be invoiced to Providers within
sixty (60) days of receipt of the Provider's required January 1 mileage report
and shall be due within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. All fees
shall be invoiced to Providers by March 1 of each calendar year.
      (7)    Cable companies operating under non-exclusive Cable Franchises for
the purposes of providing Cable Service, Video Services Provider operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing Video Services, and providers of Open
Video System services, which compensate the City under other mechanisms in an
amount equal to or greater than the Annual Registration Maintenance Fee that
would normally be required for their Right-of-Way use in the City, shall have
the mileage of the Right-of-Way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in Section
 951.07 , but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of Rights-of-
Way Costs as defined by this chapter with the exception of Permit Costs.
      (8)   The City may by separate legislation enacted by City Council on or
about February 28 of each year, in accordance with the results of Section
951.07( (a)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual Registration
Maintenance Fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year(s) Registration Maintenance Fee (per mile). Revised Registration
Maintenance Fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (b)   Timing.  Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid each calendar
year in accordance with Section
951.07 (a)(6). Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the Certificate of
Registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the Certificate of Registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one (1) full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by any taxing authority or community authority on the use of City
property as a result of a Provider's use or occupation of the Rights-of-Way,
the Provider shall be responsible for payment of such taxes or assessments.
Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in this chapter. The Registration Maintenance Fee is not in lieu
of any tax, fee, or other assessment except as specifically provided in this
chapter, or as required by applicable law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments.  If any Registration Maintenance Fee is not
paid to the City by April 1, the Provider shall pay a monthly late charge of
one percent (1%) of the unpaid balance for each month or any portion thereof
for which payment is not made. Late payments on Registration Maintenance Fees
may result in the denial of future Right-of-Way permits.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.

highly likely to place critical portions of the Provider's System in real
danger of vandalism, sabotage or an act of terrorism, must be clearly marked as
such when submitted. The City shall endeavor to exercise all reasonable legal
protections so as not to publicly disclose to any third party such information
unless required by Law. The City shall, following receipt of a request for
public disclosure of clearly marked trade secret and/or proprietary information
submitted by a Provider, use reasonable Best Efforts and endeavor to provide
five (5) days' notice to the Provider's System Representative that such a
request for public disclosure has been made, at which point it will be the
Provider's sole and exclusive responsibility to take whatever steps it deems

days following the date of the City's mailing, the Director of Public Service
shall schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum at which all then
current Providers may address any questions, concerns and make reasonable
suggestions regarding the proposed new Rules and Regulations to the Director of
Public Service. The Director of Public Service shall, following said meeting
and the review of the Providers' comments and suggestions, adopt the Rules and
Regulations in a manner that best serves the City. (Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-

respectively, that is consistent with the City's Design Guidelines and is
substantially similar to the existing Small Cell Facility and/ or Wireless
Support Structure, or the same size or smaller than the existing Small Cell
Facility and/ or Wireless Support Structure and complies with the requirements
for Construction Permits as provided in this chapter.
      (1)    For processing a Micro Wireless Permit, the City may charge a fee

five years, rounded to the nearest five dollars.
      (2)   The City shall grant or deny a Micro Wireless Permit in accordance
with any required timelines under Law.
         A.   If the City fails to approve or deny a Micro Wireless Permit
within the required time period, provided that the time period is not otherwise
tolled in accordance with the provisions of this Section
 951.10 , the Micro Wireless Permit shall be deemed granted upon the requesting
entity notifying the City that the time period for granting or denying the
Request of Consent has lapsed.
      (3)   Requests that do not meet the requirements listed on the Micro
Wireless Permit Application or stated herein or in the City's Design Guidelines
shall be deemed incomplete or shall otherwise be denied by the City.
         A.   If a Micro Wireless Permit is deemed incomplete, the City shall
provide written notice to the Applicant not later than thirty (30) days after
receiving the Application that clearly and specifically delineates all missing
documents or required information.
            1.   Once the Applicant submits the documents or information in
response to the City's notice of incompleteness, the time period for review
shall resume and the City shall grant, deny, or deem the Micro Wireless Permit
to be incomplete due to not providing the information identified in the
original notice of incompleteness.
            2.   For a Micro Wireless Permit that is deemed incomplete for a
second or subsequent time, the City shall notify the Applicant not later than
ten (10) days after receiving the Supplementary Application that the
Supplementary Application did not provide the information identified in the
original notice of incompleteness.
            3.   The City shall continue to follow the process in Section

managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
      (4)   The City shall permit a Person seeking to Construct, modify,
collocate, or replace more than one Small Cell Facility or more than one

Wireless Support Structure.
         C.   The Director of Public Service may separately address
Applications for which incomplete information has been received or which are
denied.
      (5)   If the number of requests for consent is likely to result in
difficulty processing Applications within the time limits set forth in Law due
to the lack of resources of the City, then the City may toll the time limits as
follows:
         A.   The time period for the City to grant or deny a Micro Wireless
Permit may be tolled for up to twenty-one (21) days for the first fifteen (15)

and appearance of a Wireless Support Structure, including any height
requirements adopted by the City.
      (1)   The City, as opposed to the Construction of a new Wireless Support
Structure in the Right-of-Way, shall prefer co-locating Small Cell Facilities
on existing Wireless Support Structures without increasing the Height of the
Wireless Support Structure by more than five (5) feet, including the Antenna
and any associated shroud or concealment material.
      (2)   The City shall allow, consistent with Law and for the purpose of

      (3)   The City may propose an alternate location to the proposed location
of a new Wireless Support Structure that is within one hundred (100) feet of
the proposed location or within a distance that is equivalent to the width of
the Right-of-Way in or on which the new Wireless Support Structure is proposed,
whichever is greater, which the Operator shall use if it has the right to use
the alternate location on reasonable terms and conditions and the alternate
location does not impose technical limits or additional costs.

valid for more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the construction start
date
      (3)   No Permittee may Construct in the Rights-of-Way beyond the date or
dates specified in the Construction Permit unless such Permittee:
         A.   Submits a Supplementary Application for another Construction
Permit before the expiration of the initial Construction Permit; and   
         B.   Is granted a new Construction Permit or Construction Permit
Extension.
      (4)   Original Construction Permits issued pursuant to Section
 951.17  shall, when possible, be conspicuously displayed at all times at the
indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by inspectors and
authorized City personnel. If the original Construction Permit involves work
conducted simultaneously at multiple locations, each location shall display a
photocopy of the original Construction Permit. If the original Construction
Permit is not conspicuously displayed at the indicated work site, then upon
request, the original Construction Permit must be produced within twelve (12)
hours or the first earliest Business Hour, whichever is later. For purposes of
this Section, Business Hour shall mean the hours between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
during a business day
   (b)   Construction Permit Applications.
      (1)   Application for a Construction Permit, unless an Emergency, shall

installing additional Systems or any part of a System, the posting of a
Construction Bond and Removal Bond, acceptable to the City and subject to
Section
951.21  of this chapter, for the additional Systems or any part of a System is
required.
         L.   Upon request, the Director of Public Service may modify or waive
the information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
Construction Permit application. The Director of Public Service may request
applicable and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in
evaluating the Construction Permit Application.
   
   (c)   Issuance of Permit; Conditions.
      (1)   If the City determines that the Applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter and the Construction Permit process, the Director
of Public Service shall issue a Construction Permit subject to the provisions
of Section
 951.17( c)(2).
       (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
Construction Permit and the performance of the Permittee thereunder in order to
protect the City's investment in the Right-of-Way, protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the Rights-of-Way, to
protect the property and safety of other users of the Rights-of-Way, or to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Construction Permit Fees.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided by Law, the City shall collect a
Construction Permit Fee equal to the actual and direct cost incurred by the
City that is associated with receiving, reviewing, processing and granting (or
denying) the Construction Permit and any oversight of the Construction Permit
or the Construction work associated therewith. Following completion of the
Construction work for which a Construction Permit has been granted (or at the
time of the denial of Construction Permit) the City shall calculate and assess
all actual and direct costs involved in receiving, reviewing, processing and
granting (or denying) the Construction Permit and any oversight of the
Construction Permit or Construction Work associated therewith. Quarterly, the
City will cause the Director of Finance to issue a written invoice to a
Provider that lists and summarizes the costs for each Construction Permit
issued to and/or completed by the Provider over the previous ninety (90) days.
The Provider shall remit payment to the City for the original quarterly invoice
within thirty (30) days after the Director of Finance issues such invoice. Any
Applicant who fails to timely remit such invoiced Construction Permit Fee
amounts shall be subject to the penalties of this chapter, the imposition of
any other legal or equitable remedies available to the City and the immediate
revocation of any Certificate of Registration or Construction Permit having
been issued.
      (2)   In addition to these direct and actual costs, the City may include
in the Construction Permit Fee the cost of the value of degradation and
reduction in the useful life of the Rights-of-Way that will result from
Construction that has taken place therein. "Degradation and the reduction in
the useful life" for the purpose of this Section means the accelerated
depreciation of the Rights-of-Way caused by Construction in or disturbance of
the Rights-of-Way, resulting in the need to reconstruct or repair such Rights-
of-Way earlier than would be required if the Construction did not occur.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided herein, no future Construction Permits
shall be issued to an Applicant without payment of all outstanding Construction
Permit Fee invoices. The City shall be exempt from payment of Construction
Permit Fees. Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the City
has revoked in accordance with the terms of this chapter are not refundable.
   (e)   Coordinated Applications.     Applicants are encouraged to submit
Applications for Construction Permits to work in the Rights-of-Way at the same
place and time in coordination. Coordinated Applicants shall have the ability
to divide amongst themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any
applicable Construction Permit Fees.
   (f)   Exceptions to Permit Requirements.
      (1)    The following shall be excluded from the requirements of Section
951.17 :
         A.   The repairing or improvement of streets or other public places
under or by virtue of a contract with the City.
         B.   The maintenance, planting or removal of trees and shrubs from
within the Right-of-Way.
         C.   The addition of an overhead customer service line for any
Utility, which service line does not cross across the edge of pavement limits
or extend over pavement at a height of less than fifteen (15) feet above the
pavement.
            (Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-19.)
   951.18 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the City) or another Permittee, a Permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Director of Public Service. Where
such Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party,
every Permittee located within the Rights-of-Way at issue or involved with the
work shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the City to perform the required utility engineering
study. A utility engineering study consists of, but is not limited to,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights-of-Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Director of Public Service, a Permittee shall also
record and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights-
of-Way along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section,
general location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights-of-
Way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in Section
951.18 (a)(1)(i)-(iii) on the Construction Permittee's proposed System route
maps, Construction plans, plan sheets or computer aided drafting and design
(CADD) files, or other data files in a format compatible with that used by the
City.
         E.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
951.18 (a)(1)(iv), Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A Permittee shall not excavate more than a three (3) feet by
three (3) feet square hole in the Rights-of-Way to complete this task.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)   The Director of Public Service may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to City. Upon completion of the tasks described in Section
 951.18 (a), the Construction Permittee shall submit the proposed System route
maps and Construction Plans, with the results of the utility engineering study,
in the most advanced format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or
digital format) then currently being used by the Provider that is then
currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a
readable form) by the City. The mapping data is required to be at the "Atlas"
level of detail necessary for the City to reasonably determine the location of
the Provider's facilities in the Rights-of-Way. The Provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Director of Public Service determines that the
format currently being used by the Provider is not capable of being read by the
City.
(c)   Qualified Firm.  All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Director of Public Service the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete
the project itself; alternatively, utility engineering studies shall be
performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering that is approved by the
City.
   (d)   Cost of Study.  The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
951.18 (a)-(c).
   (e)   Construction Schedule.  Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter
or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Director of Public Service
waives any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual
circumstances, a Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction
schedule to the City fourteen (14) business days before commencing any work in
or about the Rights-of-Way, and shall further notify the City not less than two
(2) business days in advance of any excavation in the Rights-of-Way. This
Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under
Section
951.20 (d) (Emergency Situations) and Section
 951.19  (Minor Maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the City's Rules and Regulations.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Rights-of-Way if the Right-of-Way is
Full, as determined in the sole discretion of the City. In making such
decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all
existing and potential users of the Rights-of-Way, but shall be guided
primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare, the
condition of the Rights-of-Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights-of-Way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights-of-Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable
installed in the subsurface Rights-of-Way pursuant to this chapter may be
required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or
fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to this chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions.
      (1)    The City may grant a special exception to the requirements of
Section
951.18 (f) and Section
951.18 (g) if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
         A.   The exception will not create any threat to the City's investment
or in the Rights-of-Way, the public health, safety or welfare.
           B.   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and
the potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the City.
         C.   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
         D.   The requirements requested by the City create an unreasonable
economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential benefit to the
City.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights-of-Way
when necessary for a governmental or public improvement purpose. In instances
where the City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all
applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the
Provider shall restore the Rights-of-Way to the same or better condition it was
in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with poles
of the same or substantially similar size, or smaller. In accordance with Law,
the Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or removal in order
to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City.
         B.   The City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
         C.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights-of-Way.
         D.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right-of-Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. Section 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities, as designated by the
City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order, or if a Provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the Rights-of-Way of the City, within twelve (12) months thereafter, then,
to the extent consistent with applicable law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person; however, the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights-of-Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any Rights-of-Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, be responsible to mark the horizontal and approximate
vertical placement of all its Facilities.
      (2)   All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights-of-Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
City Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
Restoration of Rights-of-Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall complete the Restoration of the Rights-of-Way as soon as
weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify
the City.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the City may
have the Permittee restore the Rights-of-Way or the City may restore the
Rights-of-Way itself at the Permittee's cost if the Permittee has in the past
not abided by the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights-of-
Way, the Permittee shall, at the time of Application for a Construction Permit,
post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Rights-of-Way, the City determines that the Rights-of-Way
have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be
released. The City may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirements of
posting a Construction Bond upon demonstration of good cause shown.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the Right-of-Way Restoration work
according to the standards and with the materials specified by the City. The
City shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the
Restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a
case-by-case basis. The City in exercising this authority shall be guided by
the following standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and
duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the Rights-of-Way; the
traffic volume carried by the Rights-of-Way; the character of the neighborhood
surrounding the Rights-of-Way; the pre-excavation condition of the Rights-of-
Way; the remaining life-expectancy of the Rights-of-Way affected by the
excavation; whether the relative cost of the method of Restoration to the
Permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the Rights-of-Way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance or damage to the Rights-of-Way; and the likelihood that
the particular method of Restoration would be effective in slowing the
depreciation of the Rights-of-Way that would otherwise take place. Methods of
Restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching the affected area,
replacement of the Rights-of-Way base at the affected area, and in the most
severe cases, milling, overlay and/or street reconstruction of the entire area
of the Rights-of-Way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the Rights-of-Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Service, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service.
Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service, unless
otherwise extended by the Department of Public Service.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights-of-Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
(30) days of invoicing, the Restoration cost of restoring the Rights-of-Way and
any other costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call
upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all
legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the City and/or another
Permitee(s), then the Director of Public Service may reasonably apportion the
Restoration responsibility among the City, Providers and/or other Persons.
(l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Rights-of-Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies or the City may call upon any bond or
letter of credit posted by the Permittee and pursue all legal or equitable
remedies. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
damage caused by its Facilities to the Facilities of another Provider during
the City's response to an Emergency.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
City-owned Facilities in the Rights-of-Way that the Provider or its Facilities
damage.
   (m)   Rights-of-Way Vacation.
      (1)   If the City sells or otherwise transfers a Right-of-Way that
contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer shall be subject
to any existing easements of record and any easements required pursuant to Ohio
R.C. Section 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights-of-Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, City Rules and Regulations, other
standards as may be promulgated by the Director of Public Service.
   (o)   Inspection.  When the Construction under any Permit is completed, the
Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service.
      (1)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or that violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or this chapter. The City may inspect the work;
however, the failure of the City to inspect the work does not alleviate the
responsibility of the Permittee to complete the work in accordance with the
approved Permit and the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)    The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
that does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as provided
in Section
951.23  (e). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The
decision of the Director of Public Service may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of Public
Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke
the Permit.
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other local, state or federal laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all laws, including the Ohio Utility
Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the Rights-of-Way
pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No Rights-of-Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
951.20 (d).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a Right-of-Way so as to interfere with
the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other
waterways. The Director of Public Service may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles, other than necessary Construction vehicles, may
not be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required.  Any owner of property abutting a street or
alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the City, always use Best Efforts to place
Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right-of-Way
shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-19.)
   951.19 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (a)   Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement.  No Person shall
perform minor maintenance of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way without first
having obtained a Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit as set forth in this
chapter. Minor Maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of
Facilities with like Facilities not involving Construction and not requiring
traffic control for more than two (2) hours at any one location; or (ii) the
routine repair or replacement of Facilities with like Facilities not involving
Construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours
of 9:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M.; or (iii) the routine repair or replacement of

Ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and
is for a period of less than eight (8) contiguous hours; or (iv)
Construction other than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than
eight (8) contiguous hours to complete, does not impede traffic and does not
involve a pavement cut. The Director of Public Service may adopt Rules and
Regulations pursuant to Section
951.08 (e) that clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a
process for a Provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
minor maintenance.
      (1)   A Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit allows the Permittee to
perform all minor maintenance in any part of the Rights-of-Way as required.
      (2)   A Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Director of Public Service.
      (3)   A Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (4)   A Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a Permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Director of Public Service.
   (b)    Minor Maintenance Permit Applications.  Applications for a Right-of-
Way Minor Maintenance Permit shall be made to the Director of Public Service.
In addition to any information required by the Director of Public Service, all
Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit Applications shall contain, and will only
be considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the Applicant has obtained a Certificate of
Registration or proof that the Applicant has written authority to apply for a
Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit on behalf of a party that has been issued
a Certificate of Registration.
      (2)   Submission of a completed Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit
Application in the form required by the Director of Public Service.
      (3)   A statement that the Applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, will prevent injury or damage to Persons or property and minimize
disruptions to the efficient movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (c)   Issuance of Minor Maintenance Permits; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the Applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this chapter and the Right-of-Way Minor
Maintenance Permit process, the Director of Public Service shall issue a Minor
Maintenance Permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to Rules and
Regulations enacted by the Director of Public Service, upon the issuance of the
Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit and the performance of the Permittee
thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure
the structural integrity of the Rights-of-Way, to protect the property and
safety of other users of the Rights-of-Way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Director of Public Service shall
not charge a fee for the issuance of the Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit
but may revoke the Right-of-Way Minor Maintenance Permit as any other Permit
may be revoked under this chapter. (Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-19.)
   
   951.20 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application or who is
occupying any Right-of-Way without a valid Certificate of Registration; or
      (2)    To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the City unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the City
Director of Finance and the Director of Law; or
      (3)   To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a Permit in accordance with the provisions herein; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the
issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event, the
Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights-of-
Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare
and/or the City's investment in the Right-of-Way.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Director of Public Service may deny a
Permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and/or
protect the City's investment in the Right-of-Way to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights-of-Way, or when
necessary to protect the Rights-of-Way and its users.
      (1)   The Director of Public Service, in his/her discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which Rights-of-Way space where the Permit is
sought is available;
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the Rights-of-
Way;
         C.   The availability of other locations in the Rights-of-Way or in
other Rights-of-Way for the proposed Facilities;
         D.   The applicability of this chapter or other regulations of the
Rights-of-Way that affect location of Facilities in the Rights-of-Way;
         E.   The degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of its Certificate of Registration, this chapter, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations;
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights-of-Way;
         G.   The condition and age of the Rights-of-Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction;
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Rights-of-Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Rights-of-Way; and
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of this chapter, or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on any street
except where:
         A.   An Emergency situation constitutes that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Director of Public Service determines it is in the best
interests of the City that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
951.20 (a)(1) and
 951.20( a)(2), the Director of Public Service may issue a Permit in any case
in which the Permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
or
         B.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a Permit under this section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Public Service of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith or
have those fees attributed to its quarterly invoice balance in accordance with
Section
951.17 (d) and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this chapter for all actions taken in response to the
Emergency. If the City becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Provider's
Facilities, the City may use Best Efforts to contact the Provider or the System
Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a Rights-of-Way without a valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the calculated fee for
said Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with
the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights-of-Way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a
privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right to revoke any Permit,
without refunding any fees, in the event of a failure of the Permittee to
comply with the terms and conditions of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation,
or Design Guidelines where applicable, or any provision or condition of the
Permit, including, but not limited to the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a Permit; or
         D.   The failure to maintain the required Construction or Removal
Bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued.
      (2)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the Permittee has
not complied with any law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of
the Permit, the Director of Public Service shall serve a written demand upon
the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit. The Director of Public
Service may also, in his/ her discretion, place additional or revised
conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the violation, Permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's
failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the Permit.
      (4)   If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year from
the date that the Permit was revoked, except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation. (Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-19.)
   951.21 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration, and
prior to the commencement of any Construction, and continuously thereafter, a
Provider shall deposit with the Director of Public Service and maintain an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount
determined by the Director of Public Service to be appropriate based upon fair
and reasonable criteria. The full amount of the letter of credit or surety bond
shall remain in full force and effect throughout the terms and conditions of
this chapter and/or until any necessary site restoration is completed to
restore the site to a condition comparable or better to that which existed
prior to the issuance of Certificate of Registration. Unless a Construction
default, problem or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of
the general public, the Director of Public Service shall serve written notice
to the Construction Permittee detailing the Construction default, problem or
deficiency. If the Director of Public Service determines that correction or
repair of the Construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or
has not been substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the
date following service and notification and detailing the Construction default,
problem or deficiency, then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the Construction
Permittee by the Director of Public Service.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration and
continuously thereafter, and until one hundred twenty (120) days after a
Provider's Facilities have been removed from the Rights-of-Way (unless the
Director of Public Service notifies the Provider that a reasonably longer
period shall apply), a Provider shall deposit with the Finance Director and
maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an
amount equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). The
Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Provider
a period of five (5) calendar days after serving notification in writing to
correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to the Director of
Public Service attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond regarding the
removal of Facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the
Provider by the Director of Public Service.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.  In lieu of the Construction Bond and the Removal Bond
required by this Section
951.21 , Provider may deposit with the Finance Director an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million
dollars ($5,000,000). Unless a Construction default, problem, or deficiency
involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the
Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable efforts to allow a
Provider a period of five (5) calendar days after sending notification in
writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to
Director of Public Service' attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond.
Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider by the
Director of Public Service.
   (d)    Self-Bonding. In lieu of the Construction Bond, Removal Bond, and
Blanket Bond required by this Section
951.21 , those Providers maintaining a book value in excess of fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000) may submit a statement to the Finance Director requesting
to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a Provider shall assure the
City that such self-bonding shall provide the City with no less protection and
security than would have been afforded to the City by a third party surety
providing Provider with the types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above
sections of this Section
 951.21 . This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year;
      (2)   A description of the Applicant's self-bonding program; and
      (3)   Other information as reasonably requested by the Director of Public
Service.
   (e)   Purposes.
      (1)   The letter of credit or surety bond required by this section shall
serve as security for:
         A.   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all
terms, conditions and obligations of this chapter; and
         B.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned
by the Permittee or Provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to
comply with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and other directives of the
City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
         C.   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including Permit
Fees; and
         D.   The removal of Facilities from the Rights-of-Way pursuant to this
chapter; and
         E.   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the Permittee or
Provider is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and
         F.   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this chapter or Law.

Permit or the issuance of a Certificate of Registration, the City does not
assume any liability:
         A.   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service
claims; or
         B.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of Facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.
      (1)   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with

required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
Construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a Right-of-Way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a Permit, unless the act or omission is the result of the City's negligent
or willful acts. A Provider or Permittee shall not bring, nor cause to be
brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any
other relief against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers, and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of
the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any
activity undertaken in or near a Right-of-Way, whether the act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a Permit.
This Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity
otherwise available to the Provider, Permittee or to the City; and the Provider
or Permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled
to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in
its own behalf. Any exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:
         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation workers' compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith), unless the result
of the City's negligent or willful acts; and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of Provider or Permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the
Rights-of-Way, to which Provider's or Permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the negligence of any other party shall
have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage;
and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the City's actions; and
            3.   Arising out of Provider or Permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of law applicable to Provider or Permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving Provider or Permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought; and
         B.   Affording the Provider or Permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the Provider or Permittee all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the Provider or Permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if employed.
         (Ord. 30-2019. Passed 4-22-19.)
   951.23 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at law
or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the Rights-of-Way,
including damages to the Rights-of-Way, whether caused by a violation of this
Code.
   (b)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.
   (c)   Revocability.  If a regulatory body or a court of competent
jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order that any Permit,
right or any portions of this section are illegal or unenforceable, then any
such Permit or right granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered
as a revocable Permit with a mutual right in either party to terminate without
cause upon giving sixty (60) days written notice to the other. The requirements
and conditions of such a revocable Permit shall be the same requirements and
conditions as set forth in the Permit, right or registration, respectively,
except for conditions relating to the term of the Permit and the right of
termination. If a Permit or right shall be considered a revocable Permit as
provided herein, the Permittee must acknowledge the authority of the City to
issue such revocable Permit and the power to revoke it.
   (d)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The City, by the granting
of a Permit or by issuing a Certificate of Registration pursuant to this

City under the Constitution and laws of the United States, State of Ohio and
under the Charter of the City to regulate the use of the Rights-of-Way. The
Permittee by its acceptance of a Permit, or Provider by applying for and being
issued a Certificate of Registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful
powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as now are
or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City,
shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the
City at any time. A Permittee or Provider is deemed to acknowledge that its
rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public
and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.

Bankruptcy Code by or against any Provider and/or Permittee, or any action for
foreclosure or other judicial sale of the Provider and/or Permittee Facilities
located within the Rights-of-Way, the Provider and/or Permittee shall so notify
the Director of Public Service within fourteen (14) calendar days thereof and
the Provider and/or Permittee's Certificate of Registration or Permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.

Registration or Permit granted pursuant to this chapter, subject to any
applicable provisions of law, including the Bankruptcy Code, one hundred and
twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over
and conduct the business of the Provider and/or Permittee, whether in
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said one hundred and twenty (120) days or unless:
         A.   Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after election or
appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the
provisions of the relevant Certificate of Registration, any outstanding Permit,
this chapter, and remedied all defaults thereunder; and

States, in that order. As a condition of the grant of any Permit or issuance of
any Certificate of Registration all disputes shall be resolved in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Summit County, Ohio.
   (k)   Force Majeure. In the event any Person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a

result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within

of-Way. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the Person installing Facilities in the Rights-of-Way.
   (m)   Continuing Obligation and Holdover.  In the event a Provider or
Permittee continues to operate the Facilities after the termination, lapse, or
revocation of a Certificate of Registration, such Provider or Permittee shall
continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and other
laws throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such
continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other
extension of the Certificate of Registration, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any
conflict between the issuance of a Certificate of Registration or of a Permit
and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or
police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter.

to the City required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via certified
U.S. Mail to the Mayor or Director of Public Service as specified in this
chapter
   (o)   City Facilities. As part of City required standards, wherever Rights-
of-Way are under Construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the
Director of Public Service, the City may install all such Facilities deemed
necessary to accommodate future Provider needs. Any such installed Facilities
shall be City property and may be conveyed to any Person under such terms and
conditions as are deemed advisable by the Mayor.

to the rules of the Department of Industrial Relations, the State Fire Marshal,
the Board of Building Standards, the Board of Health, the State Plumbing
Inspector, the Department of Public Welfare or any other department of the
State of Ohio having jurisdiction. Provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code
as adopted by the Board of Building Standards in accordance with the Ohio
Revised Code, more particularly set forth in the Ohio Basic Building Code and
provisions of the CABO Building Code as prepared by the Council of American

Code of Cuyahoga Falls shall govern. The CABO Building Code shall apply to town

Building Code shall apply to all other buildings.
(Ord. 219-1986. Passed 11-10-86.)

interior wall or partition within such area shall be brought into substantial
compliance with the requirements of this Building Code for new buildings of the
same type of construction as the building in question.
   (b)    Nothing in this Building Code shall prohibit the raising or lowering

provided the building is not otherwise altered or its use or occupancy changed.
   (c)    Authorization of a variation in any provision of this Building Code
by Council shall not be valid unless such variation is effected by an
ordinance, enacted and approved as required by the City Charter, amending or

is changed in occupancy or use and that portion is separated from the remainder
of the building with the required vertical and horizontal fire divisions
complying with the appropriate sections of the Ohio Basic Building Code and the
CABO, then the construction involved in the changes shall be made to conform to
the requirements for the new use and occupancy and the existing portion shall
be made to comply with the exit requirements of this Building Code.
(Ord. 219-1986. Passed 11-10-86.)
   (c)    A use or occupancy shall be deemed to be changed when changed from a

or occupancy in this Building Code.

1955, or for which it had been heretofore approved, may be continued without
change, except as may be specifically covered in this Building Code or as may
be deemed necessary by the Building Official for the general safety and welfare
of the occupants and the public.
(Ord. 132-1968. Passed 9-23-68.)
   1301.06 APPLICATION.

requirement is the most restrictive.
(Ord. 132-1968. Passed 9-23-68.)
   1301.08 SAVING CLAUSE.
   (a)    Partial Invalidity. In the event any part or provision of this
Building Code is held to be illegal or void, this shall not have the effect of
making void or illegal any of the other parts or provisions thereof which may
or shall be determined to be illegal and it shall be presumed that the Code
would have been passed without such illegal or invalid parts or provisions.
   (b)    Segregation of Invalid Provisions. Any invalid part of this Building
Code shall be segregated from the remainder of this Building Code by the court
holding such part invalid, and the remainder shall remain effective.

provision in any section of this Building Code as applied to existing buildings
and structures shall not be held to affect the validity of such section in its
application to buildings and structures hereafter erected. (Ord. 132-1968.
Passed 9-23-68.)

dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations or storage
of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” was issued by
President Carter in 1977, and requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (h)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (i)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth materials placed by artificial means.
   (j)   “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (k)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” is usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (l)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zone AI-3D and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of I to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.

500- year floodplain.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report in which FEMA and
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries and the water surface elevations of the base flood.

adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to discharge the base
flood. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic
engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface
elevation si no more than one foot. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
and is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (q)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway

accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (t)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (u)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area,
including basement, of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement areas, provided that such enclosure is built in
accordance with Section
1310.14(d) of the City of Cuyahoga Falls Codified Ordinances.
   (v)   “Manufactured Home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (w)   “Manufactured home park” means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park, as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots "are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (x)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)”  is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding." This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (y)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of Cuyahoga
Falls Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.

Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (aa)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (bb)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as “areas of special flood
hazard” means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by FEMA on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,
and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (ff)   Start of construction” means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, rehabilitation, addition, repair,
construction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (gg)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (hh)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (ii)   “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has
been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the
purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, (1) include any
improvements to a structure which is considered “new construction,” (2) any
project for improvements of a structure to correct existing violations of State
or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been
identified prior to the application for a development permit by te local code
enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or (3) any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (jj)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (kk)   “Violation” is the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant
shall be responsible for obtaining such permits.
      (3)    Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within the designated floodway as indicated in
the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Flood Insurance Study. If the proposed
development is located within the designated floodway, assure that the
encroachment provisions of Section
1310.15(a) are met.
      (4)    Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data has not been provided by FEMA in
accordance with Section
1301.03, are designated as Zone A on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Within these areas, the City Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation data available from a Federal, State or other
source in order to administer Sections
1310.14 and
1310.15.
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data is utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community’s Flood
Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rae Map, regardless of the source of
such data, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean seal
level, of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain an enclosure
below the lowest floor.

stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other application publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.

Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation - portion of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Cuyahoga Falls specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1310.16(a)(1)C., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed., as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions. Where a map boundary and
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1310.11.
      (1)   Inspect buildings and lands to determine whether any violations of
these regulations have been committed.
      (2)   Coordinate map maintenance activities and FEMA follow-up.

appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor
compliance with permit conditions.
      (5)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflects a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (6)   When preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and/ or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appealed to FEMA.
   (f)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Substantial Damage Determinations.
Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and

appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas.
   (d)   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter; and
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
       (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
      (5)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
      (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and. flood plain management program for that area;
      (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
   (e)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (d) hereof and the
purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting

report any variances to FEMA upon request. (Ord. 52-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
   1310.12 VARIANCE CONDITIONS.
   (a)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots With existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the items in Section
1310.11(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (b)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
   (c)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (e)   Variances only to be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result in
increased flood heights, beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the "public as identified in
Section
1310.11(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure shall be permitted to be built with a lowest flood
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
shall be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 52-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)

City employees include, without limitation, an amount based on the hourly rate
of pay, including all fringe benefits, of the personnel involved.
   (b)   The Director of Public Service may utilize any labor or equipment of
the City in abating a public nuisance or may contract for the abatement thereof
provided that the expenditure of funds for such abatement is properly
authorized. (Ord. 24-1998. Passed 1-20-98.)

otherwise provided for by law or ordinance of the City. (Ord. 24-1998. Passed
1-20-98.)

penalty is provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.
