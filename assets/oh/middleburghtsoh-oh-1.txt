EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 138.02 indicates that the code number is 1, the chapter number is 138
(or the 38th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 705.01 indicates that the code number is 7,
the chapter number is 705 (or the 5th chapter within code 7), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 1111.061, 1111.062 and 1111.063
follow 1111.06 and precede 1111.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

electors of the Municipality.

(Amended 5-4-71)

of the Municipality, as well as his ward, if elected as a Ward Councilman, and
a qualified elector thereof. He shall hold no other public office with the City
of Middleburg Heights, nor be employed by the City of Middleburg Heights, nor
shall he hold any other public office or employment the duties of which would
constitute a conflict of interest as defined by Section
17.07 of this Charter. (Amended 11-5-85)
SECTION 4.03   DIVISION OF MUNICIPALITY INTO FOUR WARDS.
   Council shall redivide the City into four (4) wards not later than May 15,

lines, center lines of platted streets or railroads, and shall be composed of
adjacent and compact territory.
   Council shall, at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to each
regular municipal election, adopt an ordinance re-establishing said wards if
they find and determine that there is a change in population resulting in a
variance of more than ten percent (10 percent) from the arithmetic average of
all wards.
   If no redistricting ordinance according to the foregoing standards becomes
enacted, the Mayor, within one hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the
election shall submit to the Council a plan of redistricting according to the
foregoing standards. Such plan shall become law thirty (30) days after its
submission to the Council, unless the Council shall within such thirty (30) day
period adopt a different division according to the foregoing standards.
(Amended 11-3-70)
SECTION 4.04   REMOVAL.
   The Council shall be the sole judge of the election and qualifications of
its own members. It may expel or remove any member for gross misconduct,
misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or
for the conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for
the violation of his oath of office, or persistent failure to abide by the
rules of Council, or absence without justifiable excuse for three (3)
consecutive regular meetings of the Council, provided, however, that such
expulsion shall not take place without the concurrence of at least two-thirds
(2/3) of the members elected to Council, nor until the accused shall have been
notified in writing of the charge against him at least fifteen (15) days in
advance of a public hearing upon such charge, and he or his counsel have been
given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence or examine any witness
appearing in support of, or against such charge. No individual so removed shall
be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby.
   The Council shall have the power to remove members of any Board or
Commission, Department Heads, and Division Heads, including the Police Chief
and Fire Chief, established by this Charter or as hereafter established by
ordinance of Council provided at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members elected
to Council concur in such decision. No reason, notice, written charge or public
hearing is required. The decision of Council in removing any member of any
Board or Commission, Department Head, or Division Head shall be final.
(Amended 11-3-70)
SECTION 4.05   VACANCIES.
   Whenever the office of a Councilman shall become vacant for any reason the
vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of all the remaining members of the
Council. Any vacancy in an office of a Councilman representing a ward shall be
filled from that ward. Any vacancy in the office of the President of Council
shall be filled by a Councilman.

acquired a special meaning in the law, shall be construed according to such
technical or special meaning.
   Whenever in the Codified Ordinances authority is given to an officer or an
act is required to be performed, such authority may be exercised and such act
may be performed at the instance of such officer, by a deputy or subordinate
unless contrary to law or to the clear intent of any such particular provision.
   (g)   Joint Authority. Words giving authority to a Board, Commission or to

   (q)   Tenant or Occupant. "Tenant" or "occupant" as applied to a building or
land shall extend and be applied to any person holding a written or oral lease
of or who occupies the whole or any part of a building or land, alone or with
others.
   (r)   Tenses. The use of any verb in the present tense shall include the
future.
101.03 SEPARABILITY.
   Each section and each part of each section of the Codified Ordinances is
hereby declared to be an independent section or part of a section and,

to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such section or part of a
section, or any provision thereof, or the application thereof to any person or

circumstances, other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that
the Codified Ordinances would have been adopted independently of such section,
sections or parts of a section so held to be invalid.
101.04 HEADINGS.
   The headings of the several sections, chapters and titles of the Codified
Ordinances are intended as catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections,
chapters and titles and shall not be deemed to be a part of the sections of
law.
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Wherever in the Codified Ordinances, any act is prohibited or is made or
declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or wherever in the
Codified Ordinances the doing of any act is required, or the failure to do any
act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided
therefore, the violation of any such provision of the Codified Ordinances is

107.03 PUBLIC MEETINGS REQUIRED; MINUTES.
   All meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings open to
the public at all times. A member of a public body must be present in person at
a meeting open to the public to be considered present or to vote at the meeting
and for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting.
   In times of emergency, declared by the President of the United States, the
Governor of the State of Ohio, or the Cuyahoga County Executive, a public body
may meet by teleconference, video conference, or other electronic means,
provided the meeting is open to the public. A member or members of the public
body may attend such meeting by teleconference, video conference, or other
electronic means. Each member of the public body attending in such a manner
shall be deemed present in person to vote at the meeting and present in person
for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting.
   The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such public body shall be
promptly prepared, filed and maintained, and shall be open to public
inspection. The minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of
discussions in executive sessions authorized under Section
107.05. (Ord. 1994-13. Passed 3-22-94; Ord. 2020-91. Passed 11-24-20.)
107.04 NOTICE.
   Every public body shall, by rule, establish a reasonable method whereby any
person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled meetings and
the time, place and purpose of all special meetings. A public body shall not
hold a special meeting unless it gives at least twelve hours advance notice to
the news media that have requested notification, except in the event of an
emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of an emergency,
the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the news media that have
requested notification immediately of the time, place and purpose of the
meeting.
   The rule shall provide that any person may, upon request and payment of a
reasonable fee, obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at which
any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions for advance
notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
(Ord. 1975-198. Passed 10-28-75.)
107.05 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   The members of a public body may hold an executive session only after a
majority of a quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call vote, to
hold such a session, and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole
purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
   (a)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct relating to the performance of
his or her official duties or for his or her removal from office. If a public
body holds an executive session pursuant to this subsection, the motion and
vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved purposes listed in this subsection are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the matters
listed in subsections (b) to (f) hereof, the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed
in such subsections are to be considered at the executive session.
   (b)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or the sale
of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information
would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a person whose
personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest. No member
shall use this subsection as a subterfuge for providing covert information to
prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if
the seller or buyer of the public property has received covert information from
a member that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time
for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and deliberations of
the public body have been conducted in compliance with this section, any
instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey, lease or otherwise
dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this section
insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchaser, lessee or
transferee of the property is concerned.
   (c)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body, concerning disputes
involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent court
action;
   (d)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
   (e)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or
State statutes; or
   (f)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
(Ord. 1975-198. Passed 10-28-75; Ord. 1994-13. Passed 3-22-94.)
   (g)   To consider confidential information related to the marketing plans,
specific business strategy, production techniques, trade secrets, or personal
financial statements of an applicant for economic development assistance, or to
negotiations with other political subdivisions respecting requests for economic
development assistance, provided that both of the following conditions apply:
      (1)   The information is directly related to a request for economic
development assistance that is to be provided or administered under any
provision of Chapter 715., 725., 1724., or 1728. or sections 701.07, 3735.67 to
3735.70, 5709.40 to 5709.43, 5709.61 to 5709.69, 5709.73 to 5709.75, or 5709.77
to 5709.81 of the Revised Code, or that involves public infrastructure
improvements or the extension of utility services that are directly related to
an economic development project.
      (2)   A unanimous quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call
vote, that the executive session is necessary to protect the interests of the
applicant or the possible investment or expenditure of public funds to be made
in connection with the economic development project.
107.06 NONCOMPLIANCE; EFFECT OF ACTION TAKEN; EQUITABLE RELIEF.
   A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless adopted in
an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule or formal action adopted
in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the
public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically
authorized in Section
107.05 and conducted at an executive session held in compliance with such
section. A resolution, rule or formal action adopted in an open meeting is
invalid if the public body that adopted the resolution, rule or formal action
violated Section
107.04.

6-13-17; Ord. 2024-99. Passed 12-10-24.)
II.   HOLIDAY MEETINGS.
   When any regular meeting of Council falls due on a legal holiday, or on an
election day, Council shall meet in regular session on the day following, and
at the place and hour fixed by the Rule governing the same.
(Ord. 1982-136. Passed 10-26-82.)
III.   AGENDA.
   The Clerk of Council, with the advice of the President of Council, shall
cause an agenda to be prepared for the meetings of Council. Such agenda shall
include all matters to be acted upon at the next Council meeting. Such agenda
shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to each member of Council, the Mayor,
the Engineer, the Director of Finance and the Law Director at least twenty-four
hours prior to the scheduled time of the meeting. Any matter not appearing on
the agenda shall not be subject to formal action by Council. This rule may be
suspended as provided in Rule XXII.
   A sponsor of legislation may, at any time prior to its introduction, ask the
Clerk to remove any matter from the agenda. If two regular meetings of Council
have passed without a piece of legislation on the agenda having been
introduced, the Clerk shall automatically remove it from the agenda.
(Ord. 1983-17. Passed 2-8-83.)
IV.   ORDER OF BUSINESS.
   The business of the regular meetings of Council shall be transacted in the
following order:
   1.   Roll call;
   2.   Reading and disposal of the journal;

   The presiding officer of Council may, at any time, permit a member to
introduce an ordinance, motion or resolution out of the regular order for the
same, unless the same is objected to by a majority of the members present.
V.   OPENING PROCEEDINGS.
   The President of Council shall take the chair at the time appointed for
Council to meet and shall immediately call the members to order. The President
shall then cause the journal of the preceding session to be read and disposed
of, unless otherwise ordered by Council. In the absence of the President of
Council, the President pro tem of Council shall perform such duties as are
imposed upon the President. In the absence of both the President and the
President pro tem, Council may appoint a temporary Chairperson or President.
VI.   DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS.
   The President of Council shall preserve order and decorum and shall confine
members in debate to the question. Discussion and questions pertaining to a
resolution or ordinance may properly be heard at the time of the first, second
or third reading. The President may, in common with any other member, call any
member to order who violates any of the Rules, and shall, when in the chair,
decide all questions of order, subject to any appeal to Council on the demand
of two members. On such appeal there shall be no debate, but the member making
the appeal may briefly state the reasons for the same, and the presiding
officer shall have the same right to a similar statement.
   No member of Council, while Council is in session, shall engage in debate or
discussion with anyone save another member of Council, the President or some
person who has either been granted by Council the privilege to address Council
or is present at a Council meeting on the invitation of Council.
   Any member of Council may, however, request that any person attending a
meeting be permitted to address Council at any time, in addition to the time
specifically designated for audience participation. The President shall permit
such person to address Council, upon the consent of the majority of members of
Council, at any reasonable and appropriate occasion during the meeting. The
President may provide a time limit for such person's address to Council. All
such debates and discussions shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order.
VII.   HEARINGS.
   If any elector or taxpayer of the Municipality or any other person desires a
hearing on any matter pending before Council, application may be made therefor
to Council and Council may, by a two-thirds vote, grant such public hearing by
arranging for a special time and place therefor, which must not be during any
regular or special meeting of Council.
(Ord. 1982-137. Passed 10-25-82.)
VIII.   VOTING.
   (a)   Every member present shall vote on every question (except the approval
of minutes) on the call of the yeas and nays, unless excused by the unanimous
consent of Council. Any member wishing to be excused from voting must state the
reason for the abstention on the record during discussion before a roll call
vote has begun. If there is no objection the member will be excused from
voting.
   (b)   Any member who abstains without being unanimously excused may be
censured for contempt by a majority vote of Council.
   (c)   On each successive roll call vote the order of voting will be rotated
so that the first to vote on the previous roll call will be the last to vote on
the following roll call. The order of voting will otherwise repeat the order of
the previous roll call vote.

X.   MOTIONS; WHEN DEBATABLE; WITHDRAWAL.
   When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the presiding
officer before any debate shall be in order. Any such motion, and any amendment
thereto, may be withdrawn by the movers thereof at any time before decision, if
a majority of the members then present agree thereto.
XI.   DIVISION OF QUESTIONS.
   Any member may call for a division of the question, or the presiding officer
may direct the same, and in either case the same shall be divided if it
comprehends questions so distinct that one being taken away, the other will
stand as an entire question for decision.
XII.   ADJOURNMENT.
   The motion to adjourn shall always be in order, unless Council is engaged in
voting, and the motion to adjourn or to lay on the table or for the previous
question shall be decided without debate.

   When a question or proposition is before Council, or under debate, no motion

XVI.   REFERENCE TO COMMITTEES.
   Any report, resolution, ordinance or matter before Council for consideration
(except appropriation ordinances) may, before its final passage, be referred

(Ord. 1990-72. Passed 6-12-90.)
133.13 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. It is the City’s intention to safeguard its
assets. Cash investments and equivalents comprise the most liquid part of those
assets and thus should be handled and invested with diligence and prudence.
Investments should always be made with (1) safety and (2) performance in mind.
   (b)   Scope. All monies in the Treasury of the City of Middleburg Heights
are considered investable and are thus covered in this policy, whether active,
interim or inactive.
   (c)   Authority of Finance Director. City of Middleburg Heights Charter
Section
9.02  charges the Finance Director with responsibility for investing the City’s
money. Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, the Uniform Depository Act, directs the manner in
which public funds may be invested.
   (d)   Prudence. The Finance Director shall follow the prudent investor rule,
which states that investments shall be made with judgment and care under
circumstances then prevailing which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   (e)   Risk Assessment. As stated in subsection (a) hereof, safety and
performance of the City’s investment portfolio are the main focus of the
investment policy. The City realizes that with any investment comes risk. The
safe return of investment principal is the most important aspect of this
policy, but it would be just as imprudent to take no risk, and receive no
return on the City’s money, as it would be to take too much risk for greater
returns. The types of risk that should be noted and assessed are:
      (1)   Market Risk - The risk that fluctuations in market conditions would
lead to a decrease in value of the investment.
      (2)   Default Risk - The risk that the issuer of a security could not pay
principal when due. This risk would also apply to any kind of deposit upon the
failure of a banking institution.
      (3)   Safekeeping Risk - The risk that purchased securities are not
actually held in trust, or delivered, or that adequate collateral is not
maintained to back an investment.
   Default risk and safekeeping risk can be minimized by addressing the
subjects in the depository agreements. Proper collateral and strict adherence
to the Uniform Depository Act assure that default risk should not be an issue
when investing. Another condition, which has been used by the City to reduce
the risk of loss due to default by a financial institution, is limiting the
amount of investments placed with any institution to no more than fifty percent
of the City’s investment portfolio. This also ensures that banking
relationships remain intact with all the banks in the community.
   Safekeeping risk can be reduced through use of Trustee Agreements and/or
physical delivery of securities. The Finance Director will award Trustee
Agreements as part of the depository contracts, and securities will be
delivered and held in trust with the designated trustee. Financial institutions
or brokers/dealers will be required to issue a safekeeping receipt which lists
(1) the specific securities to e held in trust as an investment of the City or
as collateral, including CUSIP numbers, (2) amounts held and (3) interest rate
and other information, including maturity dates and terms. Pooled collateral
will only be accepted upon approval of the Director of Finance.
   Unless specifically authorized by City Council, variable rate instruments
will be unacceptable in the City’s investment portfolio. It is the City’s
intention to hold all investments to maturity. In doing so the City can reduce
market risk to the extent that a specific investment will only lose market
value. The amount of principal and interest will be received by the City as
originally anticipated.
   (f)   Eligible Institutions. The Uniform Depository Act, as amended by
Senate Bill 81 in 1996, allows the City to enter into a depository agreement
with any financial institution for deposits of active, inactive and interim
moneys regardless of whether the institution has a branch located within the
City limits or not. Unless specifically authorized by motion of City Council,
the City will invest only with financial institutions that have signed a
depository agreement with the City, except as noted below.
   (g)   Eligible Investments. The Finance Director is allowed to invest in any
security or investment type allowed by the Uniform Depository Act. Eligible
investments include certificates of deposit, no-load money market mutual funds
not containing derivatives, United States Treasury securities, STAR-Ohio, bonds
of other governmental entities, commercial paper, U.S. government agency
debentures and instrumentalities and repurchase agreements (Repo). Collateral-
backed mortgage obligations, derivatives, interest-only purchases, variable
interest securities, reverse repurchase agreements, investment pools, except
for STAR-Ohio, and stocks, are prohibited unless specifically authorized by
City Council.
   The maximum maturity of any such eligible instrument is five years from the
date of settlement, unless the investment is matched to a specific obligation
or debt of the City.
   The Finance Director may enter into a repurchase agreement with an eligible
securities dealer. Eligible securities dealers must be members of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. The market value of the securities purchased
under the agreement must exceed the principal value of the repurchase agreement
by at least two percent. Term purchase agreements are limited to a maximum
maturity of thirty days and the securities purchased under the agreement must
be marked to market daily. The securities purchased must be delivered either to
the Treasury of the City, or to the trust agent as designated by the Director
of Finance.
   (h)   Competitive Selection of Investment Instruments and Institutions. When
it is determined by the Director of Finance that funds are available for
interim or active deposit, he or she will receive competitive bids from
institutions designated as a depository of such, to determine which instrument
and institution offers the best rate for the day. Other factors, including the
Director’s judgment, may determine who is awarded the investment for that day.
Other factors may include Federal Reserve wire transfer fees, bank service
charges, amounts already invested with an institution, service and, most of
all, the risk associated with the investment instrument. All factors being
equal, ties will be broken with the toss of a coin.
   (i)   Safekeeping. Physical delivery of the purchased securities to the City
Treasury is preferable, but when such is either too costly or physically
impossible, purchased securities will be delivered to an authorized trust agent
of the City. Financial institutions and brokers/dealers that do not have a
trust agreement with the City shall deliver, at its own cost, the securities to
the trust agent designated by the Director of Finance before payment is
received. Trust agents shall be awarded such designations as part of the City’s
depository contracts.
   (j)   Collateralization. The collateral provisions of the Uniform Depository
Act shall apply to all deposits, active, inactive, and interim, of the City of
Middleburg Heights. Forms of acceptable collateral shall include letters of
credit and surety bonds, as well as U.S. Treasuries and other forms of
traditional collateral.
   (k)   Financial Reporting. The Director of Finance will submit a quarterly
investment report to City Council. The report will include, at least, the
following information:
      Financial institution or dealer/broker with whom the investment is placed
      Term and maturity date of the instrument or security
      Interest rate (STAR-Ohio should show current average rate)
      Amount invested
      Interest earned (if applicable)
   The City will report its investments annually, as part of its financial
report, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
specifically in accordance with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) Statement No. 3, deposits with financial institutions, investments
(including repurchase agreements), and reverse repurchase agreements. If such
reporting requirements are changed, the City will report in compliance with
such provisions.
   Details of each investment, including the amount invested and earned, by
each fund, shall be kept by the Department of Finance, as established by the
City Records Commission.
   (l)   Other Provisions. All investing shall be performed at the direction of
the Director of Finance. The Assistant Finance Director will be authorized to
invest in the absence of the Director. An investment consultant or manager may
be used to help manage the City’s investment portfolio. Contracts for such will
be authorized by City Council.
   Wire transfers of money in and out of the City Treasury for investment
purposes shall be recorded on a wire transfer sheet, which shall include a
summary of principal maturities for the day, by financial institution, and new
investments, listed by financial institution. All wire transfers shall be
authorized by the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 1998-26. Passed 4-14-98.)
   (m)   All unrestricted investment income shall be allocated to the General
Fund, any other provision of this Code notwithstanding.
(Ord. 2005-1. Passed 1-11-05.)
133.14 PURCHASING SERVICES OR SUPPLIES VIA REVERSE AUCTION ON THE INTERNET.
   (a)   As used in this section, “reverse auction” means a purchasing process
in which offerors submit bids in competing to sell services or supplies in an
open environment via the internet.
   (b)   Whenever the Mayor, a director or City employee who has been
authorized by either, determines that the use of a reverse auction is
advantageous to the City, the Mayor, director or other authorized employee may
purchase services or supplies by reverse auction in accordance with City
Charter Section
9.05.

139.01 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.
   (a)   Statement of Policy. It is hereby declared to be the policy of
Council, through its Finance Committee and/or its designated representative(s),
to bargain collectively with City employees or their authorized representative
on matters pertaining to wages, hours and conditions of employment before any
final determination is made by Council. These procedures are intended to avoid
undue delays in arriving at positions from which meaningful negotiations can be
initiated.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   "City employee" means any employee of the City except elected
officials and appointed administrative officials.
      (2)   "City" means the City of Middleburg Heights, Ohio, or any agency,
instrumentality or department thereof, and/or elected or administrative
officials who exercise governmental powers under the ordinances of the City.
(Ord. 1969-81. Passed 7-8-69.)
   (c)   Procedures. In the event that Council determines that it needs
professional assistance with respect to collective bargaining and negotiations,
it shall employ a professional individual or company to represent it, who shall
consult and report to the Finance Committee and the Administration. Such
Finance Committee and the Administration shall determine the procedure to be
followed with respect to collective bargaining.
(Ord. 1979-33. Passed 3-13-79; Ord. 2001-38. Passed 5-8-01.)
139.02 HOLIDAYS.
   All salaried officers, employees and full-time regular hourly employees of
the City, excluding all employees whose job titles are included in a bargaining
unit pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, shall have the following
days off with pay: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, President's Day,
Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day, the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and one-
half day each on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. If any of such holidays
falls on a Saturday or Sunday, when such holiday is not being observed on the
preceding Friday or succeeding Monday, such officer or employee shall receive
comparable time off with pay on a date designated by the Mayor or the
department or division head.
   If any such officer or employee is required to work on any such holiday or
is on vacation on such holiday, such officer or employee shall receive
comparable time off with pay on a date designated by the Mayor or the
department or division head, except that hourly paid employees in the
Department of Public Service shall receive either double their regular hourly
rate for the time worked on such holidays or comparable time off, to be
determined by the Director of Public Service. Refusal on the part of an
employee to work on a holiday when requested to do so shall result in a
forfeiture of all benefits of holiday pay under this section. Failure of an
employee to work on the scheduled work day preceding, and the scheduled work
day succeeding, the holiday, unless excused by the Mayor or the department or
division head, or unless on vacation, shall result in a forfeiture of all
benefits of holiday pay under this section.
   All salaried officers, employees and full-time regular hourly employees of
the City, excluding all employees whose job titles are included in a bargaining
unit pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, shall, in addition to all
other leave benefits, be granted four personal leave days each year which are
to be taken within the year earned. Personal days shall only be taken with the
advance approval of the employee's department head and when the work staff is
at sufficient strength so that the City will not be required to have another
employee work for the employee requesting the day off. Unused personal days may
be added to the employee's sick leave accumulation, provided that such
accumulation is not at the maximum amount allowed.

Passed 12-13-22.)
139.03 VACATIONS.
   (a)   Effective January 1, 2018, all full-time salaried officers and
employees and regular hourly employees of the City who are not covered by any
collective agreement shall accrue vacation time with pay in accordance with the
schedule set forth below:
 
LENGTH OF SERVICE                 ANNUAL VACATION BI-WEEKLY ACCRUAL
0-4 Years of Employment           2 weeks         3.08
After completion of five years    3 weeks         4.62
After completion of ten years     4 weeks         6.16
After completion of fifteen years 5 weeks         7.70
After completion of twenty years  6 weeks         9.23
 
   (b)   Effective January 1, 2018, the Finance Director is hereby authorized
to account for the hourly accumulation of earned vacation time on the bi-weekly
payroll check of all eligible officers and employees. An increase in accrual
rate due to an increase in length of service will be implemented in the next
full pay period following the anniversary date.
   (c)   Any earned and accrued but unused vacation time shall be paid out at
the employee’s regular rate of pay upon the employee’s resignation,
termination, retirement or death. If the eligible employee or officer is
deceased, the payment shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Ohio Revised
Code 2113.04.
   (d)   The term “regular hourly employee” means any employee who normally
works a minimum average of forty hours per week on a fixed schedule, but does
not include temporary, seasonal or per diem employees.
   (e)   The period of vacation shall be designated by the Mayor or the
appropriate department or division head, or, in the case of employees of
Council, by Council.
   (f)   Full-time years of service accumulated by any officer or employee in
one department or division shall be credited to such officer or employee who
transfer to another department or division for purposes of computation of
vacation time. However, no officer or employee whose employment with the City
is terminated for any reason shall be entitled to the benefits of this section
regarding accumulation. No officer or employee shall receive the benefits of
this section in more than one employment capacity with the City. Purchased
service credit shall count toward longevity of service. Each three years served
as a part-time officer or part-time employee shall count as one year of
continuous full-time service for the purpose of awarding vacation time pursuant
to the schedule set forth in subsection (a) hereof.
   (g)   Effective January 1, 2018, no officer or employee shall be permitted
to accumulate more vacation time than they could earn in two years of
continuous employment. Any vacation time accumulated in excess of such limited
shall be forfeited if not used by the officer or employee, unless specifically
otherwise authorized by the Mayor.
   (h)   Any employee who has been employed for such a length of time that such
employee is entitled to four weeks of vacation in any calendar year may
accumulate up to one week of vacation per year, which accumulated time shall be
applied in a manner to permit the retirement of such employee earlier than the
retirement date to which such employee would otherwise be entitled. Such
earlier retirement shall be of a length of time equal to the number of weeks of
vacation accumulated.
   (i)   Any person employed by the City and currently accumulating vacation
leave is entitled to have his or her prior accumulated vacation leave credit
which had been earned with the State or any other political subdivision of the
State placed to his or her credit. However, this provision shall only apply to
an employee who has been, prior to his or her employment with the City, in the
continuous service of the State or a political subdivision thereof, with not
more than ten years separating his or her last employment with the City.
   (j)   Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this section, an
employee who has ten or more years of credit, may, for purposes of computing
vacation, be paid for the fourth week in equal payments, with the employee’s
regular salary spread over the year in which the vacation is earned, provided
the employee notifies the Finance Department, in writing, prior to the
employee’s anniversary date of such year, that he or she opts to be paid for
the fourth week of vacation.
   (k)   Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this section, an
employee who has twenty or more years of credit may, for purposes of computing
vacation, be paid for the fifth and sixth weeks in equal payments, with the
employee’s regular salary spread over the year in which the salary is earned,
provided the employee notifies the Finance Department, in writing, prior to the
employee’s anniversary date of such year, that he or she opts to be paid for
the fifth and/or sixth week of vacation.

139.04 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Effective January 1, 2018, all regular full-time officials and
employees of the City who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements,
shall be entitled to receive and accumulate paid sick leave benefits pursuant
to this section.
   (b)   "Sick leave" means an absence with pay necessitated by:
      (1)   Illness or injury to the employee;
      (2)   Exposure by the employee to contagious disease communicable to
other employees; and
      (3)   Serious illness or injury in the employee's immediate family.
   (c)   All full-time employees shall earn sick leave at the rate of 4.62
hours bi-weekly and may accumulate such sick leave to an unlimited amount.
However, an employee shall not earn sick leave unless he or she is in full pay
status.
   (d)   An employee who is to be absent on sick leave shall notify his or her
supervisor of such absence and the reason therefor within one-half hour after
the start of his or her work shift each day he or she is to be absent.
   (e)   Sick leave may be used in segments of not less than one hour.
   (f)   Before an absence may be charged against accumulated sick leave, the
department head may require, for cause, such proof of illness, injury or death
as may be satisfactory to him or her, or may require the employee to be
examined by a physician designated and paid for by the City. In any event, an
employee absent for three or more consecutive days must supply a physician's
report at the employee's expense, to be eligible for paid sick leave, unless
such physician's report is waived by the department head.
   (g)   If the employee fails to submit adequate proof of illness, injury or
death upon request, or if, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the report
of a medical examination, the department head finds that there is not
satisfactory evidence of illness, injury or death sufficient to justify the
employee's absence, such leave may be considered an unauthorized leave and
shall be without pay.
   (h)   Any abuse of sick leave or the patterned use of sick leave shall be
just and sufficient cause for discipline as may be determined by the department
head.
   (i)   The department head may require an employee who has been absent due to
personal illness or injury, prior to and as a condition of his or her return to
duty, to be examined by a physician designated and paid for by the City, to
establish that he or she is capable of performing his or her normal duties and
that his or her return to duty will not jeopardize the health and safety of
other employees.
   (j)   When the use of sick leave is due to illness or injury in the
employee's immediate family, "immediate family" shall be defined to include
only the employee's spouse, children, step-children residing with the employee
or parents residing with the employee.
   (k)   An employee who transfers from one department to another department of
the City shall be allowed to transfer his or her accumulated sick leave to the
new department, provided that his or her amount of accumulated sick leave shall
not exceed the accumulation limit in effect in his or her new department.
   (l)   Any employee of the City who has accumulated sick leave earned from
employment by the State or any other political subdivision of the State and who
has become employed by the City within ten years from his or her termination
from such other public employer shall be allowed to transfer such accumulation
to his or her sick leave accumulation with the City, provided that such sick
leave accumulation shall be limited to the existing maximum accruable amount in
effect at the time of transfer.
   (m)   Upon the retirement of a full-time employee who has not less than ten
years of continuous service with the City, such employee shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment equal to his or her daily rate of pay at the time of
retirement multiplied by one-third of the total number of accumulated but
unused sick hours earned by the employee, as certified by the Finance Director,
the maximum permitted under the following schedule:
      10 years of continuous service - 1/3 not to exceed 85 days
      15 years of continuous service - 1/3 not to exceed 95 days

      25 years of continuous service - 1/3 not to exceed 115 days
      30 years of continuous service - 1/3 not to exceed 125 days
   (n)   (1)   All regular full-time officials and employees of the City, and
those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, shall be entitled
to receive and accumulate paid sick leave benefits pursuant to this section.
      (2)   Any employee whose sick time bank exceeds 120 days by June 30, of
any year, will be eligible for a cash payment in July of the following year in
accordance with the following schedule:
         A.   Unused sick leave accrued between July 1, 2001, and June 30,
2002, or any July 1 to June 30 thereafter, may be converted to a lump sum
payment in accordance with the following schedule. The benefit shall be paid
during the month of July following the accrual year.
            1.   Less than 15 years of continuous service with the City, an
amount equal to 35 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days;
            2.   June 30, after 15 years of continuous service with the City,
an amount equal to 40 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days;
            3.   June 30, after 20 years of continuous service with the City,
an amount equal to 45 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days;
            4.   June 30, after 25 years of continuous service with the City,
an amount equal to 50 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days;
            5.   June 30, after 30 years of continuous service with the City,
an amount equal to 55 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days;
            6.   June 30, after 35 years of continuous service with the City,
an amount equal to 60 percent of the unused sick time exceeding 120 days.
         B.   Payment for sick leave shall be made at the employee’s rate of
pay at the time of conversion. The daily rate shall be calculated by dividing
the annual rate of pay by 260. The hourly rate will be determined by dividing
the daily rate by the number of hours in that employee’s work day.
         C.   If the sick time conversion is not elected, any accrued but
unused sick time will be used or paid at the time of retirement in accordance
with the provisions of Section
139.04(b).
      (3)   Years of continuous service shall be determined as of June 30
preceding the accrual year. Years of service accumulated by any officer or
employee in one department or division who transfer to another department or
division shall count towards continuous service. Employment with the State or
any other political subdivision of the State shall count towards continuous
service provided the employee is employed by the City within ten years from his
or her termination from such other public employer. Purchased service credit
shall count towards longevity of service. Each three years served as a part-
time officer or part-time employee of the City shall count as one year of
continuous service for the purpose of the annual conversion program.

has had prior employment with the City, although interrupted, shall be entitled
to longevity compensation computed on the basis as if it were continuous
service. Each three years served as a part-time official or part-time employee
shall count as one year of continuous full-time employment for the purpose of
awarding longevity payments pursuant to division (a) of this section.
   (c)   Any employee employed by the City in a full-time capacity prior to
January 31, 1984, who would have received longevity pay during the third and

139.21 PERS PICK-UP.
   (a)   The full amount of the statutorily required contributions to the
Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) shall be withheld from the gross pay
of each person within any of the classes established in division (b) of this
section and shall be “picked up” (assumed and paid to the PERS) by the City.
This pick-up by the City is, and shall be designated as, public employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the PERS by each person
within any of the classes established in division (b) of this section. No
person subject to this pick-up shall have the option of choosing to receive the
statutorily required contribution to the PERS directly instead of having it
picked up by the City or of being excluded from the pick-up.
   The City shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PERS, report that
the public employee’s contribution for each person subject to this pick-up has
been made as provided by State statute.
   (b)   The pick-up by the City provided for in this section shall apply to
employees of the City who are or become contributing members of the PERS
(“Covered Employees”).
   (c)   The City’s method of payment of salary to covered employees is hereby
modified as follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction pick-up of
employee contributions to PERS, as permitted under IRC Section 414(h)(2) and
rulings thereunder. The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each
covered employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under City policies,
ordinances and collective bargaining agreements. Such total annual salary and
salary per pay period of each covered employee shall be payable to the City in
two parts:
      (1)   Deferred salary; and
      (2)   Cash salary.
   A covered employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of
the employee’s total salary which is required from time to time by the PERS to
be paid as an employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An
employee’s cash salary shall be equal to that employee’s total annual salary or
salary per pay period less than amount of the pick-up for that employee, and
shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee.
The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to the PERS based
upon an employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period, including the
foregoing pick-up. The City's total combined expenditures of the City for
covered employees' total salaries, otherwise payable under applicable City
policies, ordinances or collective bargaining agreements and the pick-up
provisions of this section, shall not be greater than the amounts it would have
paid for those items had this pick-up provision not been in effect. In addition
to the foregoing, but not as part of the foregoing pick-up program, elected
officials of the City shall be reimbursed for their costs of purchasing (or
having purchased prior to the effective date of this section) additional
service credit under PERS if the purchase is made pursuant to Ohio R.C. 145.201
and is (or was) attributable to service as an elected official of the City, or
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 145.30, 145.301 and 145.302; at a time which is (or was)
prior to the PERS retirement of the elected official and while the elected
official is (or was) in office as an elected official of the City.
   (d)   For purposes of computing daily rate of pay and paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, for the purpose of computing the
compensation of a covered employee under Ohio R.C. Chapter 145, and for any
similar purpose or benefit calculation, the pick-ups provided herein shall not
be considered.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each covered employee in such manner as is required under
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at
the time of such reporting and withholding, it being the City's understanding
that Federal and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require it to
report as an employee's gross income tax his or her total annual salary without
regard to any pick-up, while applicable Municipal income tax laws may require
it to report as an employee's gross income his or her total annual salary
including the amount of the pick-up; and that the amounts picked-up hereunder
pursuant to a salary reduction agreement will be subject to applicable Federal
employment taxes unless the employee is exempt from the application of such
taxes.
   (f)   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section. Accordingly, the Director of Finance may make
applications to the Internal Revenue Service and the PERS Board to determine
their requirements in connection with this pick-up program.
(Ord. 1993-15. Passed 2-18-93; Ord. 2001-43. Passed 5-8-01.)
   (g)   If any current employee or public official of the City whose
employment with the City began prior to 1981, and whose PERS records fail to
show credit for regular PERS contributions and whose Finance Department records
fail, in the opinion of the Finance Director, to show the reason for the
failure by the City to make such contributions, then, in such cases, the
Finance Director is hereby authorized to make all back payments, plus penalties
and interest, so that such employee or public official is given full PERS
credit for the period in which the City failed to make contributions. If the
employee pays or has paid such back payments directly to PERS, then the Finance
Director is authorized to make payment to such employee or public official upon
proof of payment.
(Ord. 1997-64. Passed 5-27-97.)
139.22 EDUCATION PAY.
   (a)   All salaried officers and employees and regular hourly employees of
the City who are not covered by any collective agreement shall be entitled to
an education benefit computed as a percentage of salary and to be paid as part
of the base pay: one percent for one or more professional certificates; two
percent for an Associate Degree or three percent for a Bachelor's Degree; and
four percent for a graduate degree.
   (b)   The term "regular hourly employee" means any employee who normally
works a minimum of thirty-five hours per week, but such term does not include
temporary, seasonal or per diem employees.
   (c)   The degree or certificate must be presented to the Payroll Department
and must be employment-related, as determined by the Mayor and the Finance
Director.
(Ord. 1995-42. Passed 4-25-95.)
139.23 JURY DUTY.
   Any employee who is required to be absent from work due to serving as a
juror or as a witness due to a work-related incident shall be paid his or her
regular hourly rate for all hours absent from work, provided that he or she
surrenders all fees and/or payments for expenses he or she receives from such
duty to the employer and returns to work as soon as practicable.
(Ord. 1995-40. Passed 4-25-95.)
139.24 INJURY LEAVE.
   (a)   When an employee is injured while working for the employer,
necessitating his or her absence from work for more than three work days, he or
she shall be eligible for a paid leave not to exceed 90 calendar days,
providing he or she files for Workers' Compensation and signs a waiver
assigning to the employer those sums of money he or she would ordinarily
receive as his or her weekly compensation as determined by law for those number
of weeks he or she receives benefits under this section. If the event Workers'
Compensation pays benefits to the employee and/or employer, the employee's sick
leave for the first three days shall be restored to the amount of compensation
paid those days.
   (b)   If at the end of this 90-day period, the employee is still disabled,
the leave may, at the Mayor's sole discretion, be extended for additional 90
calendar day periods, or parts thereof.
   (c)   The employer shall have the right to require the employee to have a
physical exam by a physician appointed and paid by the employer resulting in
the physician's certification that the employee is unable to work due to the
injury as a condition precedent to the employee receiving any benefits under
this section. The designated physician's opinion shall govern whether the
employee is actually disabled or not, but shall not govern whether the employer
shall extend the period of leave.
   (d)   In the event the employer grants injury leave and the employee’s
Workers’ Compensation claim is ultimately denied on the substantive merits of a
claim after all administrative appeals through the Bureau and/or Ohio
Industrial Commission, or after the employee’s failure to timely appeal through
the administrative process, the employee shall reimburse the employer all sums
advanced. Reimbursement shall first be charged to accrued but unused sick
leave, if available. If further reimbursement is necessary, the employee shall
forfeit his or her vacation leave and/or reimburse the employer through payroll
deductions in the amount mutually agreeable between the City and the employee.
(Ord. 2002-5. Passed 2-12-02.)
139.25 CAFETERIA PLAN.
   There is hereby established a Section 125 Cafeteria Plan, for the benefit of
City employees, in accordance with the Plan Document, commencing January 1,
2001, adopted herein by reference as if fully set forth in these Codified
Ordinances. A copy of the plan is available upon request from the Finance
Department.
(Ord. 2001-118. Passed 11-27-01; Ord. 2002-94. Passed 11-12-02.)
139.26 EMPLOYEE LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM.
   The Mayor is authorized to promulgate and adopt a leave donation program,
including policies that would enable full-time employees to voluntarily donate
unused sick leave in order to provide assistance to other full-time employees
who are in critical need of leave due to the serious illness or injury of the
employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family.
(Ord. 2002-107. Passed 12-10-02.)
139.27 DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (a)   Policy Statement. The City offers equal employment opportunities to
all of their employees regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age, disability or status as a disabled or Vietnam veteran in
compliance with federal, state and local laws. This policy is applicable to all
terms and conditions of employment which include hiring, training, placement,
promotion, layoff, termination, recall, transfer, leaves of absence and
compensation.
   (b)   Zero-Tolerance for Harassment. The City has implemented a policy of
“zero- tolerance” for unlawful employee harassment. Harassment based on race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or any
other group protected by state or local laws will not be tolerated. Actions
that interfere with an employee’s ability to perform their job functions will
not be tolerated.
   Harassment based on sex violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
There are two types of sexual harassment. Quid pro quo occurs when a supervisor
or manager makes employment benefits conditional based on submission to sexual
advances. Hostile work environment occurs when a superior, co-worker or even a
non-employee creates a sexually offensive environment.
   It is the policy of the City that the following behavior is prohibited:
      (1)   Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and all
other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or otherwise offensive nature,
especially where:
         A.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of employment;
         B.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis
for decisions affecting an individual’s employment; or
         C.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Offensive comments, jokes, innuendo’s, and other statements of a
sexual nature which are pervasive in the work environment.
      (3)   Some examples of sexual harassment are:
         A.   Making sexually suggestive statements or comments;
         B.   Telling off-color jokes;
         C.   Hanging sexually explicit pictures, jokes, calendars or posters;
         D.   Touching, fondling or stroking in a sexually suggestive manner;
         E.   Standing or speaking too close;
         F.   Sending unwanted, sexually suggestive correspondence;
         G.   Repeatedly asking for a date;
         H.   Asking for sexual favors in exchange for employment benefits.
   (c)   Procedure for Filing Complaints. If any City employee experiences
harassment that is job-related based on race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age, or disability or if any employee believes that they have been
subject to unlawful, discriminatory treatment, the incident should be promptly
reported to their supervisor. In the event the supervisor is the harasser, the
employee should report the incident to another party such as the Safety
Director or Law Director. All incidences of harassment by supervisors, co-
workers or non-employees should be reported even if the incidences occurs
during non-working hours or off the work premises.
   The City takes claims of harassment and discrimination very seriously.
Consequently, the formal chain of command need not be adhered to when reporting
incidences. All complaints will be handled in a timely manner and kept
confidential as much as possible.
   If the City finds that the accused is guilty of harassing another
individual, proper disciplinary action will be taken up to and including
employment termination.
   The City does not allow retaliation of any type against the employee making
the complaint. However, false claims by an employee will not be tolerated and
disciplinary action will be taken against any individual making such a claim.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
      Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Middleburg
Heights has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the
violation of a Middleburg Heights ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all
criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways
located within the corporate limits of Middleburg Heights, subject to the
limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and
file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Berea Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23 (A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Middleburg Heights ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved
does not exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operator's or driver's or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or
pleads guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (DWI) , in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided in this chapter for allocating net
profits to the City.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide, by rules and regulations, the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

191.05 EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid with

(Ord. 1968-76. Passed 6-25-68.)
191.06 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to Municipal income tax, if
the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both
within and without the City disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of
its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession
conducted within the City, then only such portion shall be considered as having
a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of such tax. The portion of the
entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from
within the City shall, in the absence of actual records thereof, be determined,
as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in a business or profession in the City
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this
paragraph, "real property" includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer
and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual
rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City and wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   If the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an equitable result,
another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce
such result.
   (b)   As used in paragraph (a)(3) hereof, "sales made in the City" means all
sales of tangible personal property which is:
      (1)   Delivered within the City, regardless of where title passes, if
shipped or delivered from a stock of goods within the City;
      (2)   Delivered within the City, regardless of where title passes, even
though transported from a point outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion; or
      (3)   Shipped from a place within the City to purchasers outside of the
City, regardless of where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
   (c)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with paragraphs
(a) (1), (2) and (3) hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in subsection (a) hereof.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City.
(Ord. 1966-133. Passed 12-27-66.)
191.07 RETURNS.
   (a)   Filing Date. Each taxpayer shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon,
make and file a return on or before April 30 of the year following the
effective date of this chapter and on or before April 30 of each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or any other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months
from the end of such fiscal year or period.
(Ord. 1971-164. Passed 12-14-71.)
   (b)   Form and Content. The return shall be filed with the Administrator on
a form furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, setting
forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from a business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require.
   (c)   Extension of Time for Filing.  The Administrator may extend the time
for filing of the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period
of not to exceed six months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax Return. The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is
normally due. No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which
the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Administrator.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with some other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a fair
and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
191.15 and
191.19. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended return showing income subject to the income tax of the
Municipality, based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
         (Ord. 1966-133. Passed 12-27-66.)
191.08 PAYMENT OF TAX ON FILING OF RETURNS.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon. However, where
any portion of the tax due has been deducted at the source pursuant to Section
191.09 or has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to Section
191.10(a), or where an income tax has been paid on the same income to another
municipality, credit for the amount so deducted or paid, or credit to the
extent provided for in Section
191.19, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability under this chapter or, at his or her election
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
(Ord. 1971-164. Passed 12-14-71.)
191.09 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the Municipality,
shall deduct, at the time of the payment of such salary, wages, commissions or
other compensation, the tax of two percent (2%) of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to such employee, and
shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return and pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month.
However, if the amount of the tax so deducted by an employer in any one month
is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) the employer may defer the filing of
a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the month
following the end of the calendar quarter in which such month occurred.
   (b)   Returns shall be on a form prescribed or acceptable to the

therefor by the Administrator. An employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have, in
fact, been withheld.

EMPLOYEE.
   The officer or employee having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing any return or declaration required by this chapter and
making payment, or any officer of a corporation who is responsible for
execution of the corporation's fiscal responsibilities, shall be personally
liable for failure to file any return or declaration or pay the tax or employer
withholding due by the provisions of this chapter. The dissolution, termination

entities, estimated to be earned by the taxpayer during the current tax year,
together with the estimated tax due thereon, less tax withheld within the
Municipality, less the tax credit allowed in Section
191.19, unless such taxpayer anticipates that such tax will be fully withheld
within the Municipality and that any income earned outside of the Municipality
will be fully taxed at the same or a higher rate of tax in another
municipality. If the estimated tax for the current year, less the tax to be
withheld and less such tax credit, amounts to not more than fifty dollars
($50.00), no declaration or payment of estimated tax is required.
(Ord. 1995-66. Passed 6-13-95.)
   (b)   The declaration required by subsection (a) hereof shall be filed on or
before April 30 of each year during the life of this chapter, or within four
months of the date the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period. (Ord.
1966-133. Passed 12-27-66.)
   (c)   The declaration required by this section shall be filed upon a form
furnished by or obtainable from the Administrator. As provided in subsection
(a) hereof, credit shall be taken for the City tax to be withheld from any
portion of such income and credit shall be taken for tax to be paid or withheld
and remitted to another taxing municipality, in accordance with Section
191.19.
   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for in this section.
(Ord. 1971-164. Passed 12-14-71.)
   (d)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the Municipality shall
be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax
and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the
seventh and tenth months after the beginning of the taxable year and on or
before the last day of the first month of the succeeding year following the
taxable year. However, if an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the
remaining payment dates. (Ord. 1973-186. Passed 11-27-73.)
   (e)   On or before the last day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which such declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Municipality shall
be paid therewith in accordance with Section
191.08. However, a taxpayer may file, on or before the last day of the first
month of the year following that for which such declaration or amended
declaration was filed, an annual return and pay any balance due at such time in
lieu of filing such declaration or an amended declaration, and in lieu of
paying the final quarterly installment based upon a declaration or amended
declaration of estimated tax.
(Ord. 1971-164. Passed 12-14-71.)
191.11 EXTENSIONS.
   The Administrator may extend the time of filing any return required, of
making any payment or performing any other act required by this chapter, for a
period not to exceed six months beyond the original required date.
(Ord. 1966-133. Passed 12-27-66.)

Municipality, shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years showing

unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments when
a taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain hardship
conditions, he or she is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her under this chapter.
   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid
amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the
provisions of Sections
191.15(a) and
191.16(a) shall apply.
   (e)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Municipality from the
taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
(Ord. 1966-133. Passed 12-27-66.)
191.13 INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.

examine the books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax Returns of any
employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Administrator
believes is subject to, this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy
of any return made or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under
this chapter. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed
taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish, upon written request by
the Administrator, or his or her duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person presumed to
have knowledge of the facts to appear before him or her and may examine such

returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for
this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal
Income Tax Returns and the attendance of all persons before him or her, whether
as parties or witnesses, whenever he or she believes such persons have
knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal Income Tax
Returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination, by any employer or
person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with any provision of this chapter or with an
order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
191.99.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential except for official purposes or except in accordance with proper

Individuals.
   (A)   For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

192.02 (C)(16)).

and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section

year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.04 (C);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)   Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

192.12 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall

calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
       (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform

any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or

than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:

qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely

election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed

            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(l)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 192.04.

all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred
compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred
compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
       (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
          (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
          (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
          (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
          (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
          (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
       (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
       (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
  Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

         (a)   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)   “Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead
81 Income Tax Effective January 1, 2016 192.04
there are two or more municipal corporations in which the employee spent an
identical number of days that is greater than the number of days the employee
spent in any other municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of
the employee's qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this
section among those two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be
made using any fair and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an
equal allocation among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon
the time spent or sales made by the employee in each such municipal
corporation. A municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated
under this division shall be the employee's "principal place of work" with
respect to those qualifying wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.
         (e)   "Professional entertainer" means a person who performs services
in the professional performing arts for wages or other remuneration on a per-
event basis.
         (f)   "Public figure" means a person of prominence who performs
services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or similar
events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         (g)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the City
if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
192.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
192.04. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15; Ord. 2018-4. Passed 1-23-18.)
192.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
192.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
       (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the City income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)   The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
       (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
       (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
       (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the City . No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the City's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
       (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
       (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
       (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (G)(3), or (G)(4) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
            If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section,
the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
            Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
           (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within the
City.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations”. The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.   
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
       (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
       (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
          (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
       (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
       (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five- year
period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
192.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

192.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
    (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the City under this chapter.
   (B)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

192.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than a individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
192.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For

date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
192.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

192.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
192.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
       (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
       (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, that taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City income
tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
       (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
192.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that

inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
    (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-73.

      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
          (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
       (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
       (1)   Compromise a claim;
       (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

192.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
192.03;
      (7)   (a)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
       (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
       (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
192.04.
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   (B)   (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
192.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
192.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
192.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
192.18.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
192.99 for a violation of Section
192.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
    (D)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.21 BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
City at any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding
the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of the
City. This member may be an employee of the City, but may not be the Director
of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar
official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any
direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two years.
There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve if the member
is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the
Mayor of the City shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)
192.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
City, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the Tax
Administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an
income tax imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter. Such rules
shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this chapter.
Taxpayers are hereby required to comply not only with the requirements of this
chapter, but also to comply with the Rules and Regulations.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

tax herein provided for. Any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter
or any tax against or exception granted any individual or any of the several
groups of persons, or forms of income specified herein if found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, or part hereof,
not been included therein.

concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of taxes levied
hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so levied or
enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall continue
effective until all of said taxes levied hereunder in the aforesaid periods are
fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of said
taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully
terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
192.12 and Section
192.99.

as the City's Income Tax Rules and Regulations. In the event of a conflict with
any provision(s) of the City Income Tax Ordinance and the RITA Rules &
Regulations, the Ordinance will supersede. Until and if the contractual
relationship between the City and RITA ceases, Section
192.26 will supersede all other provisions within
Chapter 192 regarding promulgation of rules and regulations by the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 2015-73. Passed 11-10-15.)

may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.

contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
         B.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the offender
instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the duration

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
         B.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for
the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(1) of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
         B.   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

414.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   (b)   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall

effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
(ORC 4511.12)
414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently

signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

432.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right- of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one- way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
      (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the centerline of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the centerline in making a left
turn into or from an alley, private road or driveway.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   (e)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.25)
432.02 PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   (a)   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass

the same direction shall, except as provided in subsection (a)(3) hereof,
signal to the vehicle to be overtaken, shall pass to the left thereof at a safe
distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until
safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. When a motor vehicle overtakes and
passes a bicycle or electric bicycle, three feet or greater is considered a
safe passing distance.
      (2)   Except when overtaken and passing on the right is permitted, the
operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle at the latter’s audible signal, and he or she shall not
increase the speed of his or her vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.
      (3)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction on a divided highway as defined in Ohio R.C.
4511.35, a limited access highway as defined in Ohio R.C. 5511.02, or a highway

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.27)
432.04 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO RIGHT OF VEHICLE.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of
another vehicle only under the following conditions:
      (1)   When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled
by the overtaking vehicle.
   (b)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle only
under conditions permitting such movement in safety. The movement shall not be
made by driving off the roadway.
432.05 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT OF CENTERLINE.
   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless such
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made,
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for
traffic approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.
432.06 DRIVING UPON LEFT SIDE OF ROADWAY.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be driven upon the left side of the roadway under the
following conditions:
      (1)   When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve in the

create a hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct or tunnel;
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing.
   (b)   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a
roadway where traffic is lawfully directed to be driven to the left side, or
under the conditions described in Ohio R.C. 4511.25(A)(2) or a substantially
similar municipal ordinance.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.30)
432.07 HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section 331.06.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply when all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed of the
speed limit applicable to that location.
      (2)   The faster vehicle is capable of overtaking and passing the slower
vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
432.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
432.08 DRIVING IN MARKED LANES OR CONTINUOUS LINES OF TRAFFIC.
   (a)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked
lanes for traffic or wherever traffic is lawfully moving in two or more
substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules
apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.33)
432.09 FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY.
   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more
closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   (b)   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle,
when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district shall
maintain a sufficient space, whenever conditions permit, between such vehicle
and another vehicle ahead so an overtaking motor vehicle may enter and occupy
such space without danger. This paragraph does not prevent overtaking and
passing nor does it apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
   (c)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade, shall maintain a sufficient space
between such vehicles so an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy such space
without danger. This paragraph shall not apply to funeral processions.
432.10 TURNING AT INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle intending to turn at an intersection shall be
governed by the following rules:
      (1)   Approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close
as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.
      (2)   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the
roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that
portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such
vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as
to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane of
the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in that
lane.
      (4)   Markers, buttons or signs may be placed within or adjacent to
intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that
specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection,
and when such markers, buttons or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle
shall turn such vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required
by such markers, buttons or signs.
   (b)   The Department of Transportation and local authorities may cause
markers, buttons or signs to be placed within or adjacent to intersections, and
thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this
section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection, and when markers,
buttons or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle shall turn the vehicle
at an intersection other than as directed and required by the markers, buttons
or signs.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.36)
432.11 "U" TURNS RESTRICTED.
   (a)   Except as provided in Section

of any other vehicle approaching from either direction.
   (b)   The driver of an emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle, when
responding to an emergency call, may turn the vehicle so as to proceed in the
opposite direction. This subsection applies only when the emergency vehicle or
public safety vehicle is responding to an emergency call, is equipped with and
displaying at least one flashing, rotating or oscillating light visible under
normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of the
vehicle, and when the driver of the vehicle is giving an audible signal by
siren, exhaust whistle or bell. This subsection does not relieve the driver of
an emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle from the duty to drive with due
regard for the safety of all persons and property upon the highway.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under §
408.05.
(R.C. § 4511.37)
   (d)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, no vehicle shall be
turned so as to proceed in the opposite direction within an intersection, or
upon any street in a business district, or upon a freeway, expressway or
controlled-access highway, or where authorized signs are erected to prohibit
such movement, or at any other location unless such movement can be made with
reasonable safety to other users of the street and without interfering with the
safe operation of any traffic that may be affected by such movement.
432.12 STARTING AND BACKING VEHICLES.

submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician- intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.
R.C. § 4511.191(D))

of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of

a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under R.C.
Chapter 4506. Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
this division is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an

term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction
pursuant to § R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the

criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying
case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.

this section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in
a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under Ohio R.C. 5104.011, that
is required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those
subsections, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Ignition interlock device” means a device that connects a breath
analyzer to a motor vehicle’s ignition system, that is constantly available to
monitor the concentration by weight of alcohol in the breath of any person
attempting to start that motor vehicle by using its ignition system, and that
deters starting the motor vehicle by the use of its ignition system unless the
person attempting to so start the vehicle provides an appropriate breath sample
for the device and the device determines that the concentration by weight of
alcohol in the person’s breath is below a preset level.
      (2)   “Offender with restricted driving privileges” means an offender who
is subject to an order that was issued under Ohio R.C. 4507.16(F), as a
condition of the granting of occupational driving privileges or an offender

driving privileges, unless motor vehicle is equipped with a functioning
ignition interlock device that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.83(D).

period that he or she is required to operate only a motor vehicle equipped with
an ignition interlock device, shall request or permit any other person to
breathe into the device or start a motor vehicle equipped with the device for
the purpose of providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(2)B. below, no person shall
breathe into an ignition interlock device or start a motor vehicle equipped
with an ignition interlock device for the purpose of providing an operable
motor vehicle to an offender with restricted driving privileges.
         B.   Division (c)(2)A. above does not apply to an offender with
restricted driving privileges who breathes into an ignition interlock device or
starts a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device for the
purpose of providing the offender with an operable motor vehicle.
      (3)   No unauthorized person shall tamper with or circumvent the
operation of an ignition interlock device.

when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are

from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)

the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
606.10 FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of
unemployment compensation; Ohio works first; prevention, retention and

governmental agency of a license, permit, authorization, certificate,
registration, release or provider agreement.
      (6)   The statement is sworn or affirmed before a notary public or
another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to that person’s detriment.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

petition, complaint or other pleading, or an inventory, account or report.
      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (13)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery
sale.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under subsection (a)(6) hereof that the
oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner.
   (c)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the
offender within the period of the statute of limitations for falsification, it
is not necessary for the prosecution to prove which statement was false, but
only that one or the other was false.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsection (a)(1) to (8) or
(10) to (13) hereof is guilty of falsification, a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (a)(9) hereof is guilty of
falsification in a theft offense, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the
value of the property or services stolen is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
more, falsification in a theft offense is a felony and shall be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
   (e)   A person who violates this section is liable in a civil action to any
person harmed by the violation for injury, death, or loss to person or property
incurred as a result of the commission of the offense and for reasonable
attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred as a result of
prosecuting the civil action commenced under this section. A civil action under
this section is not the exclusive remedy of a person who incurs injury, death,

   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
606.22 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)

      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

liability insurance in the State of Ohio providing coverage for each
occurrence, subject to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of not less
than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) because of damage or bodily injury
to or death of a human being caused by the animal.
      (2)   If the owner or custodian of the dangerous animal files a notice of
appeal of the Director of Service's decision with a court of competent
jurisdiction, the order of the Animal Warden to remove the dangerous animal
from the City or to impose reasonable terms, conditions and restrictions which
the Animal Warden deems are necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare shall not be stayed pending the appeal.

animal wishes to reclaim and remove it from the City, the Animal Warden shall
release it, provided that the animal is taken to its new location outside the
City immediately and directly upon its release. No person to whom such animal
is released shall fail to remove the animal immediately and directly from the

   (a)   No person, who is the parent, guardian, custodian, person having

or a child with a mental or physical disability under 21 years of age, shall
create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a
duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,
protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian,
custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical
or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.
   (b)   No person shall do any of the following to a child under 18 years of
age or a child with a mental or physical disability under 21 years of age:
      (1)   Abuse the child.
      (2)   Torture or cruelly abuse the child.
      (3)   Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary
measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged
period, which punishment, discipline or restraint is excessive under the
circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the
child.

when there is a substantial risk that such conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child’s mental health or development.

allow the child to act, model, or in any other way participate in, or be
photographed for, the production, presentation, dissemination, or advertisement

know is obscene, is sexually oriented matter, or is nudity-oriented matter.
   (c)   (1)   No person shall operate a vehicle in violation of Section
434.01(a) of the Traffic Code when one or more children under eighteen years of
age are in the vehicle. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person
may be convicted at the same trial or proceeding of a violation of subsection
(c) hereof and a violation of Section
434.01(a) of the Traffic Code that constitutes the basis of the charge of the
violation of subsection (c) hereof. For purposes of Ohio R.C. 4511.191 to
4511.197 and all related provisions of law, a person arrested for a violation
of subsection (c) hereof shall be considered to be under arrest for operating a
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination

teacher, person pursuing bona fide studies for research, librarian, member of
the clergy, prosecutor, judge, or other person having a proper interest in the
material or performance.
      (2)   Mistake of age is not a defense to a charge under division (b)(5)
of this section.
      (3)   In a prosecution under division (b)(5) of this section, the trier
of fact may infer that an actor, model, or participant in the material or
performance involved is a juvenile if the material or performance, through its
title, text, visual representation, or otherwise, represents or depicts the
actor, model, or participant as a juvenile.
      (4)   As used in this division and division (b)(5) of this section:
         A.    "Material," "performance," "obscene," and "sexual activity" have
the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2907.01.

that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation,

and results in serious physical harm to the child involved, endangering
children is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

section and results in serious physical harm to the child involved, endangering
children is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   If the offender violates division (b)(2), (3), (4) or (5) of this
section, endangering children is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.
      (3)   If the offender violates division (c) of this section, the offender

section, endangering children in violation of division (c) of this section is a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
         D.    In addition to any term of imprisonment, fine, or other
sentence, penalty or sanction it imposes upon the offender pursuant to
divisions (e)(3)A., B. or C. of this section or pursuant to any other provision
of law, the court may also impose upon the offender one or both of the

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege of the offender for up to
90 days, in addition to any suspension or revocation of the offender's driver's

the violation of division (c) of this section, the offender also shall be
sentenced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.99, or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance, and also shall be subject to all other sanctions that are
required or authorized by any provision of law for that violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.19(A), or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (f)   (1)   If a person violates division (c) of this section and if, at the
time of the violation, there were two or more children under 18 years of age in

         (ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
R.C. § 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this
division (a) and, if the offender is being sentenced for a criminal offense as
defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall sentence the offender to make restitution
pursuant to this division (a) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its
discretion or as required by this division (a), imposes one or more financial
sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this
division (a) include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Restitution.
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (R.C. § 2929.24)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by division (G)
of Section 1547.99, division (B) of Section 4510.14, division (G) of Section
4511.19 of the Ohio Revised Code, or any other provision of the Ohio Revised
Code a court that imposes a sentence under this Code upon an offender for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion to determine the most efficient
way to achieve the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in Section
2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is precluded from
being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the penalty for an
offense or by any provision of Sections 2929.23 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised
Code, a court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may
impose on the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under Sections
2929.24 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code. The court shall not impose a
sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall determine whether the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense and, to the extent applicable,
shall proceed as follows:
         A.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older, permanently and totally disabled, or under eighteen years of age
at the time of the commission of the offense, regardless of whether the
offender knew the age of the victim or knew of the victim’s disability, and if
the offense is a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, the court shall
consider that fact in favor of imposing a jail term on the offender, but that
fact shall not control the decision of the court.
         B.   If the court determines that the victim was sixty-five years of
age or older or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission
of the offense, regardless of whether the offender knew the age of the victim
or knew of the victim’s disability, the court shall consider that fact in favor
of imposing a financial sanction of restitution on the offender under Section
2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code, but that fact shall not control the decision
of the court.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court shall
consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding th offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   The criminal history and character of the offender in general, in
addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and C. of this
section.
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(2)B. and
C. of this section.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the court
may consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 2929.21 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(a) or R.C. §§ 2929.25, 2929.26, and 2929.27. A court may impose the
longest jail term authorized under § 698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit
the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to
prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the
longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender from committing a future
criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Sections 2743.51 to 2743.72 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         (ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section
698.02 hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
   Type of   Maximum
   Misdemeanor    Fine
   First degree   $5000.00
   Second degree   4000.00
   Third degree   3000.00
   Fourth degree   2000.00
   Minor   1000.00
   Misdemeanor not
    specifically classified   2000.00
   Minor misdemeanor not
    specifically classified   1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this section.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be
pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section defining the
offense.
      (3)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, division (E) of
Section 2929.14, or division (D) or (E) of Section 2971.03 of the Ohio Revised
Code, a prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment shall be served
concurrently with any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment
imposed by a court of this state, another state, or the United States. Except
as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, a jail term or sentence of
imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or
sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal correctional
institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively, or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Section
2907.322, 2921.34, or 2923.131 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   When consecutive sentences are imposed for misdemeanor under this division,
the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, except
that the aggregate term to be served shall not exceed eighteen months.
      (2)   If a court of this state imposes a prison term upon the offender
for the commission of a felony and a court of another state or the United
States also has imposed a prison term upon the offender for the commission of a
felony, the court of this state may order that the offender serve the prison
term it imposes consecutively to any prison term imposed upon the offender by
the court of another state or the United States.
      (3)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Section 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code shall be served consecutively to a prison term that is imposed for
a felony violation of Section 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08, or 4511.19 of the Ohio
Revised Code or a felony violation of Section 2903.04 of the Ohio Revised Code
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively.
   When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms
are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Ohio Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty
to a violation of a municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to a
provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period of time
the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the municipal ordinance shall not exceed the period of suspension
that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the provision
of the Ohio Revised Code to which the municipal ordinance is substantially
similar.

701.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Admission charge," in addition to its usual and ordinary meaning,
means and includes a charge made for season tickets or subscriptions; a cover
charge or a charge made for use of seats and tables, reserved or otherwise, and
similar accommodations; a charge made for automobile parking where the amount
of the charge is determined according to the number of passengers in an
automobile; or a charge made for the right or privilege to enter into a place.
However, if such charge includes rental of property or services, it shall be
deemed to be an admission charge if so designated, unless the charge is for
rental or services, and persons who do not use such property or services are
admitted free. If a lesser charge is made to persons who do not desire to use
the property or services offered, the lesser charge shall constitute the
admission charge. The designation of the charge as a rental or service charge
shall not be construed to avoid the application of the tax if it is, in effect,
a charge for admission.
   (b)   "Director of Finance" means the Director of Finance of the City and/or
the authorized representative of the Director.
   (c)   "Place" means any enterprise permitted, conducted or operated by a
person for which there is an admission charge. Examples of places are theaters,
dance halls, night clubs, taverns, amphitheaters, museums, auditoriums,
stadiums, skating rinks, bowling alleys, athletic pavilions and fields, parks,

copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.

701.02 LEVY OF TAX.
   For the purpose of providing additional revenue to the City for use in
meeting its general operating expenses, there is hereby levied and imposed upon
every person who pays an admission charge to any place:
   (a)   A tax of three percent on the amounts paid for admission to any place,
including admission by season ticket or subscription, which tax shall apply to
every admission within the City for which a charge is made, notwithstanding
that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right of admission thereto is
made outside of the City;
   (b)   A tax of three percent on the excess of the amounts paid for tickets
or cards of admission to theaters, operas and other places of amusement, sold
at newsstands, hotels and places other than the ticket offices of such
theaters, operas and other places of amusement, over and above the amounts
representing the established price therefor at such ticket offices, such tax to
be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
701.04 by the person selling the ticket; and
   (c)   A tax of three percent on the amount paid for admission to any public
performance for profit at any roof garden, night club, cabaret or other similar
entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form of a service
charge, cover charge or other similar charge.
      (Ord. 1987-101. Passed 10-13-87.)
701.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any
admission all the proceeds of which inure:
      (1)   Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or community
service organizations, or charitable institutions, societies or organizations,
if no part of the net earnings thereof inures to the benefit of any private
stockholder or individual;
      (2)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval
forces of the United States, National Guard organizations, reserve officer
organizations, posts or organizations of war veterans or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State and if no part of their net
earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual;
      (3)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons who have served in the
military or naval forces of the United States and are in need;
      (4)   Exclusively to the benefit of members of any department fund of any
municipal corporation or the dependents or heirs of such members;
      (5)   Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation under the control of a recreation commission; or
      (6)   Exclusively for annual membership dues for a health or fitness
club.
   (b)   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from the admission
tax has been allowed, the treasurer of the institution, society or organization
for whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Director of Finance setting forth the amount of money actually received by such
treasurer together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such event.
Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from the admission tax for the benefit of such institution, society or
organization and if such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for
promoting and conducting such event in relation to the profits, if any, no such
exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
   (c)   The exemption from the tax provided in this section shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or organization that does not control the
sale of admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall
any exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated
for on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of
the flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.
(Ord. 1987-101. Passed 10-13-87.)
701.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment.
The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held
in trust by the person required to collect the same until paid to the Director
of Finance as herein provided. No person required to collect the tax imposed
under this chapter shall fail to collect the same or, having collected the
same, fail to remit the same to the Director in the manner prescribed by this
chapter, whether such failure is the result of his own act or the result of
acts or conditions beyond his control. In the case of such failure the person
shall nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax,
in addition to the penalty provided in Section
701.99. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day of
the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made
by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director,
but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from
liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Director unless the
check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person receiving
any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms and setting
forth such information as the Director may require, showing the amount of the
tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director with a remittance for such
amount, provided that the Director has the discretion to require verified
annual returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such
additional information as is deemed necessary to determine correctly the amount
of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition,
entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the
tax herein levied, and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of
which the Director shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and
remittance of the admission tax immediately upon its collection, at the
conclusion of the performance or exhibition, at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibition or at such other times as the Director determines.
No person shall fail to comply with any requirement of the Director as to
report and remittance of the tax as required. The books, records and accounts
of any person collecting the tax herein levied shall, as to admission charges
and tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject to examination and
audit by the Director. If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when it
is due there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of five
percent per month from the time the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 1976-23. Passed 2-24-76.)
701.05 CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Director of
Finance, make application to and procure from the Director a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be five dollars ($5.00), which
certificate shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the
same is issued. Such certificate of registration or duplicate original copies
thereof, to be issued by the Director without additional charge, shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of
admission are sold.
(Ord. 1976-23. Passed 2-24-76.)
701.06 CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENTS.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary place or transitory amusement,
entertainment or exhibition by a person who is not the owner, lessee or
custodian of the building, lot or place where the amusement is to be conducted,
the tax imposed by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in
Section
701.04 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the
Director of Finance of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability
for collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1976-23. Passed 2-24-76.)
701.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter for carrying out and
enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A
copy of such rules and regulations shall be published as ordinances of the City
are published before they shall become effective and copies shall be printed
and made available in the office of the Director. No person shall fail or
refuse to comply with any such rule or regulation.
(Ord. 1976-23. Passed 2-24-76.) .
701.08 APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Director of Finance under the provisions of
this chapter shall be made to Council within ten days after such ruling and
Council shall have authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling appeals
from, in conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 1976-23. Passed 2-24-76.)
701.09 DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS.
   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into the possession of
the Director of Finance or other agent or employee of the City, shall be held
confidential. No person shall make any disclosure thereof unless ordered by a
court of competent jurisdiction, except that the Director may furnish the
Bureau of Internal Revenue, Treasury Department of the United States, with
copies of returns filed.
   This section shall not prohibit the Director from providing Council with the
names of persons or businesses who or which have filed a return under this
chapter for any particular year when requested to do so by Council.
(Ord. 1986-144. Passed 12-23-86.)
701.10 VIOLATIONS.
   No person charged by this chapter with the duty of collecting or paying the
taxes imposed by this chapter shall purposely fail or refuse to charge and
collect or pay such taxes, or purposely fail to make a return to the Director
of Finance as required by this chapter, or purposely fail to permit the
Director to examine books and other records in or upon any premises where the
same are kept, to the extent necessary to verify any return made or to
ascertain and assess the tax imposed by this chapter if no return was made, or
purposely fail to maintain and keep for three years, or such lesser or greater
time as may be permitted or required by the Director, such records, ticket
stubs and other documents pertaining to the sale or other disposition of
admissions, as may be required by the Director.

The tax shall apply to every hotel within the City for which a charge is made,
notwithstanding that the reservation of the lodging is made outside the City.
(Ord. 1968-121. Passed 9-10-68.)
703.03 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   Every person receiving any payment upon which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
lodging payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or
having collected the same, fails to remit the same to the Director of Finance
in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his or her own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his or her
control, shall nevertheless be personally liable to the City for the amount of
such tax and shall, unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty
of a violation of this chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at
the time the lodging charge is paid by the transient guest seeking lodging in a
hotel or motel and shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the
tax to the Director of Finance in either twelve or thirteen annual installments
and remittances therefor on or before the final day of the period next
succeeding the end of the period in which the tax is collected or received.
Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless payment
or remittance is otherwise required by the Director of Finance, but payment by
check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for
payment and remittance of the tax to the Director of Finance unless the check
is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person receiving any
payment for lodgings from a transient guest shall make out a return upon such
forms and setting forth such information as the Director of Finance may
require, showing the amount of the tax upon lodgings for which he or she is
liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same
to the Director of Finance with a remittance for such amount, provided that the
Director of Finance may, in his or her discretion, require verified annual
returns from any person receiving lodging payments setting forth such
additional information as he or she may deem necessary to determine correctly
the amount of tax collected and payable, and failure to comply with any
requirement of the Director as to report and remittance of the tax as required
shall be a violation of this chapter.
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied
shall, as to lodging and tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject to
examination and audit by the Director of Finance. If the tax imposed by this
chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest
at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax became due until
paid.

valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued. Such
certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof, to be issued
by the Director of Finance without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.

and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied
and a copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in the City record
at least once before they shall become effective and copies shall be printed
and made available in the office of the Director of Finance. Failure or refusal
to comply with any such rules or regulations shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter.

section, the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation, State of
Ohio, relating to excise taxes in effect on March 11, 1968, except as the same

thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining sections
or parts of sections, and the application of such provision to any persons or

affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that this chapter would have been

be invalid.

731.07 ABANDONED STATIONS.

property values and to be detrimental to the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort or property or the general welfare of the community and
shall be abated. "Abandoned" and "closed" are defined as operating for less
than three consecutive months in any one-year period.
   Whenever the Director of Public Service finds any gasoline service station
to be abandoned within the meaning of this section, he shall give notice in the
same manner as service of summons in civil cases or by certified mail addressed
to the owner of record of the premises at his last known address or the address
to which tax bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to
abate such abandoned condition within thirty days either by placing the station
in operation in accordance with this chapter, adapting and using the building
for another permitted business use as approved by the Planning Commission, or
by razing the gasoline and oil filling station structure, removing the pumps,
storage tanks and signs and filling depressions to the grade level of the lot,
provided, however, that if the station is in operation at the time notice is
given and remains in operation for ninety consecutive days thereafter, or is
placed in operation within three months after notice is given and continues to
operate for ninety consecutive days, the provisions of this section shall not
apply, and provided, further, that Council may, by resolution, determine that
by reason of the effect of a national emergency which would curtail the
operation of motor vehicles, or by reason of a state of general economic
depression, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the notice
to abate such abandonment, the Director of Public Service shall advise the
Director of Law of all the facts and such Director of Law shall proceed to
exercise, on behalf of the City, any remedy which shall then be available to it
to secure an abatement of such abandonment, including any that pertains to the
abatement of a public nuisance, and to recover any damages or enforce any
penalties which may be recovered or imposed at the instance of the City.
   Inoperative service stations (being those which have remained closed for two
consecutive weeks), whether or not abandoned, shall be maintained in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter and the owner shall cut all grass and
remove all rubbish and weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles
upon such premises shall be prohibited and the owner shall place in the window
of such gasoline and oil filling station a sign of at least ten square feet in
area notifying the public of this fact, and the owner of the premises shall
install fencing approved by the Director of Public Service which will be

indicating the price shall be at least six inches in height and the outline

of shipment. The form shall include the date of shipment, the type and quantity
of radioactive materials involved, the method of transportation, the route, the
starting point, the destination and such other information as such Director may
reasonably require. Any information which cannot be supplied two weeks prior to
shipment or transportation shall be supplied promptly by the person responsible
for such shipment or transportation when such information becomes available to
him. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the disclosure of any
defense information or restricted data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of

involved is, in the opinion of the agency, permitted by Federal or State
regulations pertaining to the shipment or transportation of radioactive
materials and that the interest involved justifies the apparent risks resulting
from such shipment or transportation.
   (b)   Radioactive materials, which are permitted to be shipped or
transferred through the City pursuant to this chapter, shall be shipped or
transported through the City over such a route or at such a time of day as is
consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the public and the
convenience of the shipper or carrier, as the Safety Director of the City may

shall be identified to the City geologist or petroleum engineer who shall
ensure that such person or persons are adequately experienced and will take
adequate precautions to avoid any danger to any person or property. If any well
site, in the opinion of the City Engineer or the hydrologist, is sufficiently
close enough to potentially adversely affect any existing pond, stream, lake or
other body of surface water, the applicant shall construct diversionary ditches
and devise and construct an impounding system to contain any liquids that might
otherwise escape from the well site. Such ditches and impounding systems shall
be constructed in a manner approved by the City Engineer.

applicant shall notify the Director. The applicant shall advise the Director of
the length of time the well shall be capped and shall further notify the
Director when the well will again be made productive. The Director, upon
receiving notice of the applicant's intention to cap the well, shall notify the
City geologist or petroleum engineer who shall then inspect any well after it
is capped to ensure that the applicant has safely capped the well. If the well
is capped for more than one year, abandonment proceedings shall be commenced
and completed within one month thereafter unless an extension is requested by
the applicant and approved by the Planning Commission.
   (17)   The applicant shall not permit any hydrocarbons or brines to enter
the Sharon or Berea Sandstone formations during drilling or production of any
oil and gas well. If such contamination of either Sandstone occurs, the
applicant shall immediately notify the Director who shall than notify the City
hydrologist to determine if any temporary or permanent damage has occurred to
the potable water supply.
   (18)   During the drilling stage, no other improvement or additional use
shall be placed on the drilling unit. Following the initiation of production,
as approved by all City officials, such additional improvements and uses as may
conform to the Zoning Code may be initiated on the drilling unit subject to the
restrictions of all other applicable laws and regulations of the City and the
State. In recharge districts, no new structure shall be located within 2,000
feet of any well site area within the drilling unit or any land outside the
drilling unit contiguous thereto and owned by the applicant. Within a discharge
district, no new structure shall be located within 300 feet of any well site
area. No person shall plat or develop a minor or major subdivision on the
drilling unit while any well is still producing and has not been abandoned
without first obtaining the approval of the Planning Commission after a public
hearing and notice and in accordance with procedures set out for public
hearings in the Subdivision Regulations. No minor or major subdivision shall be
permitted to be developed by the Commission if such subdivision would endanger
the health, safety or welfare of the residents of such subdivision, any
structure to be developed thereon and any water well or central water system to
be constructed on the drilling unit. The Commission shall ensure that no
development is permitted, and that no common area in any subdivision is
permitted to be developed, in violation of the Zoning Code or within a distance
from any well site that would cause other detriment to the health, safety and
welfare of the residents or to the natural resources of the City. The
Commission shall ensure that no structures or common areas are permitted to be
developed in an area that may be unreasonably exposed to dangers associated
with production, transmission or abandonment of oil and gas wells. The well
site area shall include the oil and gas well, any storage or separation tanks,
compressor stations, and pit or contamination areas for the storage of brine
and other wastes.
   (19)   The applicant shall be prohibited from accumulating combustible
materials in the well site areas, and, upon order of the Fire Chief, shall
remove any combustible materials that, in the opinion of the Chief, may be
hazardous. Permanent no-smoking signs shall be posted at the entrance gate, and
on the oil storage tanks, and temporary signs shall be posted at the drilling
site until production commences. No person shall smoke any cigarette, cigar,
pipe or other form of tobacco, have any matches, or open flames or burn any
other combustible materials at the well site during drilling or when handling
or removing gas at the well site. The applicant shall ensure that when any
welding occurs on the premises, suitable welding screens are utilized to
protect any person from injury.
   (20)   All artificial lighting used during drilling or production of any gas
and oil well shall be designed, constructed and located in such a manner as to
prevent emission upon any property not within the drilling unit.
   (21)   The use of nitroglycerin as an explosive shall be prohibited during
any phase of drilling, fracturing, operation, production or abandonment of a
gas and oil well. The applicant and any contractor shall be permitted to use an
explosive other than nitroglycerin to perforate the casing and cement prior to
fracturing of a well. Explosives shall not be used to otherwise increase the
porosity and permeability of the subsurface, and fracturing shall be through
the process of hydro-fracturing, unless otherwise approved by the City
geologist or petroleum engineer.
   (22)   No person shall refine or otherwise process for extraction the
products of a gas and oil well except when necessary to make gas acceptable to
flow through gas transmission lines. If the latter becomes necessary, the
applicant shall notify the Building and Zoning Director prior to commencement
of such processing or production. Any burner unit installed in an oil storage
tank shall be properly vented and monitored to ensure no excess heating within
the tank while in use.
   (23)   If, during drilling, the site will be unattended at any time, and
during the completion phase of drilling, when the well site area is unattended,
the applicant shall cap the assembled sections of the well to avoid any hazard
or leakage of hydrocarbons, wastes or other elements.
   (24)   All pipe and related fittings must be equal to or better than the
American Petroleum Institute Code 5-L, Grade B, and shall consist of prime
material with standard coating. Any deviation from these standards shall be
approved by the City geologist or petroleum engineer prior to construction of
the same at the well site. Upon completion of construction of all tanks and
other apparatus to remain on the well site and the laying of pipelines, the
applicant shall return all disturbed public or private roads, driveways, walks
or approaches to their original condition before disturbance to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer. The applicant shall backfill to the existing
grade level in such a manner as to prevent erosion or siltation and shall
complete all of the same within fourteen days after completion of installation
of storage tanks and other apparatus and pipelines.
   (25)   A hydrostatic test of all pipelines from the well to the separator
and from the separator to transmission lines shall be performed by the
applicant prior to placing such line on any section thereof into operation. A
hydrostatic test, or such other test as may be approved by the City geologist
or petroleum engineer, shall consist of a pressure not less than twice the
expected maximum operating pressure and shall be recorded over a minimum period
of forty-eight hours. If any drop of pressure is noted within such forty-eight
hour period, the line shall not be made operational until the line is capable
of performing as set forth in this paragraph.
   (26)   All gas produced from wells shall be transported from the drill site
by means of underground pipelines connected directly with the producing well to
the separator or treating facilities by a completely closed system which shall
be not larger than that sufficient to contain and store 210 barrels of oil
(each barrel capable of holding forty-two U.S. gallons).
   (27)   All waste substances, such as drilling muds, brine or acids, produced
or used in connection with drilling operations or production, shall be retained
in watertight receptors from which they shall be hauled for disposal outside of
the City within ten days after the completion of drilling, and no production
shall commence until such removal has occurred.
   (28)   Truck routes in and out of the well site shall be approved by the
Planning Commission. The Commission shall require that the truck routes through
City streets be limited to roads that can accept the load limits and shall
consider routes that will minimize wear on public streets within the City and
that would prevent hazards and damage to other properties in the City.
   (29)   The applicant shall be responsible for maintaining the public roads
in a debris-free condition at all times, and the applicant shall cause the
public roads to be free of all debris, mud and other materials that accumulate
as a result of drilling, production, transmission, hauling or abandonment
proceedings.
   (30)   The applicant shall provide one off-street parking space for each
employee engaged in the drilling process and shall provide at least two
permanent off-street parking spaces at the site where production equipment will
be located. All trucks, machinery, drilling rigs and other equipment
temporarily stored at the site shall be kept within a temporary fenced-in area
around the well site when not in use. All materials extracted during drilling
and stored at the site shall be kept within such fenced-in area.
   (31)   In addition to the regulations set forth herein, the Planning
Commission may, after a public hearing, impose such other conditions,
requirements and limitations, and delegate authority to other City officials,
which the Commission may deem necessary for the protection of property and
person and in furtherance of the health, safety and welfare of the residents of
the City and surrounding communities.
(Ord. 1986-6. Passed 4-28-87.)
749.13 FENCING AND LANDSCAPING.
   All storage tanks and other equipment remaining at the well site after
drilling operations are complete shall be fenced with a locked gate within
thirty days. The Planning Commission shall determine if landscaping (i. e.
trees, bushes, fences, etc.) around equipment and tanks is required to provide
concealment for abutting properties and surrounding properties, and a
landscaping plan shall be submitted to the Commission for approval. The
landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. All dead and dying
landscaping shall be removed and replaced. All fences shall have a minimum
height of eight feet above grade with a barbed wire top. All fence posts shall
be set into concrete to a minimum depth of three feet below grade. All fence
mesh shall be flush with the grade, as practical.
(Ord. 1986-6. Passed 4-28-87.)
749.14 MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT.
   All equipment shall be painted and remain in a good state of appearance. No
person shall permit a gas or oil well or tank to become deteriorated, damaged
or in such disrepair as to cause leakage of gas or oil. Such leakage of gas or
oil shall constitute a nuisance and repairs shall be made forthwith.
(Ord. 1986-6. Passed 4-28-87.)
749.15 FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS.
   (a)   The permittee shall have a DANGER sign, as approved by the Fire

complaints, identifying the subscriber and describing the nature of the
complaints and when and what action was taken by the cable operator in response
thereto. Such records shall be kept for a period of three years at the cable
operator's local office, reflecting the operations to date, subject to
applicable laws regarding subscriber privacy, and shall be available for
inspection during regular business hours.
      (3)   The Mayor or a designee shall serve as the City Complaint Officer,
with primary responsibility for the continuing administration of complaint
procedures hereunder. Any subscriber, user, programmer or other interested
person who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television service,
equipment malfunctions, billings or any other matter, which remains unresolved
for thirty days after it has been brought to the cable operator's attention,
may file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon the filing
of such a complaint, said Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and
make an investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to
credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines after such
investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations of the
complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and the
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion. In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain
conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a
hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will
be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within thirty days thereafter, either
the cable operator or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing,
the decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Officer. Council's decision shall not preclude either
the cable operator or the complainant from pursuing the matter in a court of
competent jurisdiction before or after the decision.
      (4)   Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there exists

to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, own, operate,
maintain and reconstruct cable television systems within the City limits.
   (b)   The City Council finds that the development of cable television
systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents
of the City. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated
with cable television, the City Council further finds that the public
convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing, to
the extent permitted by State and Federal law, regulatory powers which should
be vested in the City or in such persons as the City shall designate.
   (c)   It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent amendments to provide
for and specify the means to attain the best possible cable television service
to the public, and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise and/or the cable system or any
of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the prior consent
of the Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and
shall be denied only upon a good faith finding by the City that the proposed
transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform
its obligations under the franchise agreement, and then only upon such
reasonable terms and conditions as the grantor may require. Any attempt to
sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or otherwise dispose of the franchise
and/or the cable system without the consent of the Council shall be null and
void. This provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the
normal course of business. No consent from the City shall be required for a
transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or
in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a
corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with the grantee.
   (b)   The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other
transfer of the franchise and/or the cable system requiring compliance with
this section:
      (1)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of the
grantee's assets;
      (2)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in the grantee by one or more
of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in the grantee;
      (3)   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by the grantee so as to create a new controlling
interest in the grantee; and
      (4)   The entry by the grantee into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of the grantee and/or the system to such extent as to
effectively relinquish corporate control of the system.
   The term "controlling interest" as used herein means majority equity
ownership of the grantee.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided below, or unless waived by the grantor as
provided under Section
753.34, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a franchise and/
or a cable system prior to the substantial completion of the initial design or
initial construction of said system by the grantee. In the case of a sale of
multiple systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently
transfer ownership of one or more such systems to one or more third parties,
such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above-
described holding period shall not apply to:
      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable
system which is not subject to Federal income tax liability;
      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency,
any State or political subdivision or the City; or
      (3)   Any sale, assignment or transfer to one or more purchasers,
assignees or transferees controlling, controlled by or under common control
with the seller, assignor or transferor or its affiliate.
   (d)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/
or cable system, the City shall have 120 days to act upon any request for
approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such
information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications Commission
regulations, the requirements of this chapter and such other reasonable
information as the City, in its sole discretion, may request. During the review
period, the grantor may advise the grantee that a public hearing is deemed
necessary to evaluate any potential adverse effect of the sale or transfer upon
the grantee's subscribers. In such event, the grantee shall receive written
notice of the hearing and of the opportunity to participate fully in it, as far
in advance as possible, but in no event less than fourteen days prior to the
start of the hearing. If the City fails to render a final decision on the
request within 120 days from receipt by the City of all required information,
such request shall be deemed granted, unless the requesting party and the City
agree to an extension of time. Such request to transfer may be conditioned upon
the performance of additional reasonable requirements imposed upon the grantee
by the grantor, and, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, the
payment of a nonrefundable transfer fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)   The grantee shall notify the grantor in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property
of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or
a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of
the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this section governing the
consent of the grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply.
   (f)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking the grantor's
consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee shall have the
responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes an application in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the grantor, which application shall
include the information required under State and Federal law as well as under
Section
753.13(b). An application, acceptable to the City, shall be submitted to the
grantor not less than ninety days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee
shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and
financial qualifications to operate and maintain the system and to comply with
all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If,
after considering the legal, technical and financial qualifications and the
character of the applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, the
grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, the grantor shall transfer and
assign the rights and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the grantor
to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied.
   (g)   The consent or approval of the grantor to transfer by the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor in or to
its public rights-of-way or easements, and any transfer shall by its own terms
be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement. A sale, transfer or assignment of the franchise may not be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the
franchise agreement.
   (h)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the. construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee
satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable
television system in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within thirty days of assuming such control, which plan will
insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during
the term that the financial institution exercises control over the system. The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period
exceeding one year, unless extended by the grantor in its discretion, and
during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to
transfer the franchise to another grantee.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.09 PURCHASE BY CITY.
   (a)   The grantor may, at any time, offer to purchase the grantee's cable
system for the same consideration and according to the same terms that it is
willing to accept from any person. The grantee shall have thirty days from
receipt of the offer from the grantor within which to accept or reject the
offer.
   (b)   In any case where the grantor elects to purchase and the grantee
agrees to sell the system, the purchase shall be closed within sixty days of
the date of the grantor's audit of a current profit and loss statement of the
grantee.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.10 GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE; MULTIPLE DWELLING UNITS (MDUs).
   (a)   The grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television
system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit, school, library and
Municipal building in the service area, subject to any line extension
requirements of the franchise agreement.
   (b)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any part of the service area, the grantee shall provide
cable service to any non-commercial subscriber requesting a standard
installation within that part of the service area within seven days from the
date of request if no further construction is required, or within thirty days
if construction is required, provided that the grantee is able to secure all
rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber on reasonable
terms and conditions within such thirty-day period. For purposes of this
section, a request shall be deemed made on the date of signing a service
agreement, receipt of funds by the grantee, receipt of a written request by the
grantee or receipt by the grantee of a verified verbal request.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement or by Federal
law, the grantee shall provide such service:
      (1)   With no line extension charge, except as specifically authorized in
the franchise agreement.
      (2)   At a non-discriminatory installation charge for a standard
installation, with additional charges for non-standard installations computed
according to a non-discriminatory methodology for such installations, as
adopted by the grantee.
      (3)   At non-discriminatory monthly rates for residential subscribers.
   The grantee may establish different and non-discriminatory rates and charges
of services for commercial subscribers, as well as different, non-
discriminatory monthly rates for classes of commercial subscribers, upon
written notice to the grantor.
   (d)   The grantee shall be required, in accordance with this chapter and
applicable law, to provide service to individual units of a multiple dwelling
unit or "MDU" with all services offered to other dwelling units within the

753.17 RATE REGULATION; SENIOR CITIZEN DISCOUNTS; PROMOTIONS; BROADCAST BASIC
SERVICE; GUARANTEED SERVICE CALLS.
   (a)   The City reserves the right to regulate rates for basic cable service

other promotions to other subscribers.
   (d)   Nothing herein shall prohibit the temporary reduction or waiving of
rates or charges in conjunction with valid promotional campaigns.

   (f)   The grantee shall guarantee that installations and service calls will
be performed during the time period agreed upon with the subscriber, or
subscriber remuneration will be provided as specified in the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.18 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   Following the issuance and acceptance of a franchise, and as
compensation for the benefits and privileges granted under the franchise, and
in consideration of permission to use the grantor’s streets and rights-of-way,
the grantee shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee based upon the grantee's
annual gross revenues in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (b)   The grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished with a statement
within 120 days of the close of the calendar year, certified by an officer of
the grantee or audited by a certified public accountant, reflecting and
attesting to the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all payments and
computations for the previous calendar year. At any time and upon thirty days
prior written notice, and no more than once per calendar year, the grantor
shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of the grantee's records,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and if such audit
indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or more, the grantee
shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or any franchise agreement or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
   (d)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is
not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, and the
grantee has failed to cure, the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an
interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the
prime lending rate plus one and one-half percent during the period for which
payment was due.
   (e)   In the event any payment is not received within thirty calendar days
from its due date, the grantee shall further be assessed an additional amount,
with regard to the payment, of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day. In the
event any payment is not received within seventy-five calendar days from its
due date, the grantee shall be assessed an additional amount, with regard to
the payment, of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. The grantee's liability
for such amount in such cases shall not be subject to, but shall be in addition
to, the remedies set forth in Section
753.29 for franchise violations and may be taken from the performance bond in
accordance with Section
753.24.
   (f)   Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule
indicated in the franchise agreement and shall be accompanied by a report in
summarized form of the grantee's gross receipts during the period and the
computation of the payment amount upon which revenues shall be listed by
category, including, but not limited to, subscription revenues (such as basic
and pay services), nonrecurring revenues (such as pay-per-view) and
nonsubscriber revenues.
   (g)   The grantor represents that it is its intention to be able to charge
up to the maximum amount of franchise fees allowed by law, which is presently
set at five percent. This maximum may be amended during the term of the
franchise by any higher maximum amount that may be set by FCC regulations or
the Cable Act, as the same may be amended from time to time. The grantor may
change the percentage to be set forth in the franchise agreement by ordinance
or resolution of the grantor's Council and upon written notice to the grantee,
as long as the same does not exceed the maximum amount the grantor is
authorized to collect as allowed by law at the time of the change and as long
as the grantor collects the same percentage from all other cable operators
operating a cable television system in the franchise area. The grantee shall
implement the change within sixty days of written notice of the same by the
grantor.
   (h)   No term or condition in this chapter or the franchise agreement shall
in any way modify or affect the grantee's obligation to pay franchise fees,
unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. Although the total sum of
franchise fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in this
chapter or in the franchise agreement may total more than the maximum allowable
percentage of the grantee's gross revenues in any twelve-month period, the
grantee agrees that the additional commitments are not franchise fees as
defined under any Federal law, nor are they to be offset or credited against
any franchise fee payments due to the grantor, nor do they represent an
increase in franchise fees to be itemized as such on the subscriber's bill.
   (i)   Payment of the franchise fee under this chapter or the franchise
agreement shall not exempt the grantee from the payment of any other license
fee, tax, levy, assessment or charge on the business, occupation, services,
property or income of the grantee which is or may hereafter be lawfully imposed
on all entities engaged in the same business as the grantee.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.19 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS; STREET AND OTHER PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Construction.
      (1)   Subject to applicable laws, regulations and ordinances of the
grantor and the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, the
grantee may perform all construction necessary for the operation of its cable
system. All construction and maintenance of any and all facilities within
streets incident to the grantee's cable system shall, regardless of who
performs the construction, be and remain the grantee's responsibility. The
grantee shall apply for, and obtain, all generally applicable permits necessary
for construction or installation of any facilities, and for excavating and
laying any facilities, within the streets. The grantee shall pay all applicable
fees upon the issuance of the requisite construction permits by the grantor to
the grantee.
      (2)   Prior to beginning any construction, the grantee shall provide the
grantor with a construction schedule for work in the streets. When the
grantee's construction of facilities in the streets is completed, the grantee
shall provide the grantor with a map showing the location of the installed
facility in the streets, as built, in detail, excluding proprietary
electronics. All as-builts shall be available for inspection.
      (3)   The grantee may make excavations in streets for any facility needed
for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. Prior to doing
such work, the grantee shall apply for, and obtain, generally applicable
permits from the grantor, and give appropriate notices to any other
franchisees, licensees or permittees of the grantor, or bureaus of the grantor,
or other units of government owning or maintaining pipes, wires, conduits or
other facilities which may be affected by the proposed excavation.
      (4)   In the event that emergency repairs are necessary, the grantee
shall immediately notify the grantor of the need for such repairs. The grantee
may initiate such emergency repairs and shall apply for appropriate permits
within forty-eight hours after discovery of the emergency. The grantee shall
comply with all applicable grantor regulations relating to such excavations or
construction, including the payment of permit or license fees.
   (b)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   Within forty-eight hours after any grantor franchisee, licensee or
permittee notifies the grantee of a proposed street excavation, the grantee
shall, at the grantee's expense:
         A.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground facilities
within the area of the proposed excavation;
         B.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities in
the area of the proposed excavation; or
         C.   Notify the excavator that the grantee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
      (2)   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the grantee's plant was cut for
whatever reason, then the grantor's franchisee, licensee or permittee shall be
required to notify the grantee and pay for the repair of the grantee's plant.
   (c)   Restoration of Streets.
      (1)   Whenever the grantee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the grantee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition. When any opening is made by the grantee in a hard surface pavement
in any street, such grantee shall promptly refill the opening and restore the
surface to a condition reasonably satisfactory to the grantor.
      (2)   If the grantee excavates the surface of any street, such grantee
shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface within the
area affected by the excavation in accordance with applicable regulations of
the City. The grantor may, after providing notice and an opportunity to correct
to the grantee, refill and/or repave any opening made by the grantee in the
street, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the grantee. The grantor may,
after providing notice and an opportunity to correct to the grantee, remove
and/or repair any work done by the grantee which, in the determination of the
grantor, is inadequate. The cost thereof, including the costs of inspection and
supervision, shall be paid by the grantee. All excavations made by the grantee
in the streets shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention of accidents.
All of the grantee's work under the franchise agreement and this chapter, and
this section in particular, shall be done in strict compliance with all rules,
regulations and ordinances of the grantor.
   (d)   Maintenance and Workmanship.
      (1)   The grantee's cable system shall be constructed and maintained in
such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes or any other property
of the grantor, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures
or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by, or under, the
grantor authority.
      (2)   The grantee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the grantee's signals so as to prevent injury to
the grantor's property or property belonging to any person. The grantee, at its
own expense, shall repair, renew, change and improve its facilities as listed
above in good repair and in a safe and presentable condition.
   (e)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon the grantee's acquisition of cable-
related facilities in any grantor street, or upon the addition or annexation to
the grantor of any area in which the grantee owns or operates any cable related
facility, the grantee shall, at the grantor's request, submit to the grantor a
statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise,
permit, license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent that the grantee has possession of such information.
Such facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of the franchise
agreement.
   (f)   Reservation of Grantor Streets Rights. Nothing in the franchise
agreement or this chapter, shall prevent the grantor or public utilities owned,
maintained and/or operated by public entities other than the grantor from
constructing sewers; grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any street;
laying down, repairing or removing water mains; or constructing or establishing
any other public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as
practicable, so as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the use and operation of
the grantee's cable system. However, if any of the grantee's system interferes
with the construction or repair of any street or public improvement, including
construction, repair or removal of a sewer or water main, such portion of the
grantee's system shall be removed or replaced in the manner the grantor shall
reasonably direct, and the grantor shall in no event be liable for any damage
to any portion of grantee's cable system. Any and all such removal or
replacement shall be at the expense of the grantee. Should the grantee fail to
remove, adjust or relocate its facilities by the date established by the
grantor's written notice to the grantee, the grantor may effect such removal,
adjustment or relocation, and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by
the grantee, including all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
grantor due to the grantee's delay.
   (g)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the grantee
is vacated by the grantor during the term of the franchise, then unless the
grantor specifically reserves to the grantee the right to continue its
installation in the vacated street, the grantee shall, without delay or expense
to the grantor, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities in such street,
restore, repair or reconstruct the street where removal has occurred, and
replace the street to the condition in which it was found. In the event of
failure, neglect or refusal of the grantee, after a time period to be
negotiated by the grantor and grantee, to restore, repair or reconstruct such
street, the grantor may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost
thereof may be collected by the grantor from the performance bond pursuant to
Section
753.24(c).
   (h)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever the grantee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the grantee shall submit for
the grantor's approval a complete description of the facility and the date on
which the grantee intends to discontinue using the facility. The grantee may
remove the facility or request that the grantor permit it to remain in place.
Notwithstanding the grantee's request that any such facility remain in place,
the grantor may require the grantee to remove the facility from above the
street or modify the facility to protect the public health, welfare, safety and
convenience, or otherwise serve the public interest. The grantor may require
the grantee to perform a combination of modification and removal of any such
above-ground facility. The grantee shall complete such removal or modification
in accordance with a schedule set by the grantor. Until such time as the
grantee removes or modifies the facility as directed by the grantor, or until
the rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility, the grantee
shall be responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility,
as well as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the
facility were in active use, and the grantee shall retain all liability for
such facility.
   (i)   Hazardous Substances.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable State and Federal
laws, statutes, regulations, the National Electrical Safety Code, and orders
concerning hazardous substances, relating to the grantee's cable system in the
streets.
      (2)   The grantee shall maintain and inspect its cable system located in
the streets. Upon reasonable notice to the grantee, the grantor may inspect the
grantee's facilities in the streets to determine if any release of hazardous
substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the grantee's cable
system. In removing or modifying the grantee's facilities as provided in the
franchise agreement or this chapter, the grantee shall also remove all residue
of hazardous substances related thereto.
      (3)   The grantee agrees to forever indemnify the grantor against any
claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, whether direct or indirect, incurred
by the grantor arising out of release of hazardous substances caused by the
grantee's cable system in the streets.
   (j)   Undergrounding of Cable. Existing facilities of the grantee's and
existing portions of the grantee's cable system shall be placed underground at
the grantee's expense when all other utilities in the same rights-of-way,
including cable operators, place their facilities underground or when required
of all utilities and persons by general ordinances of the grantor or applicable
State or Federal law.
   (k)   Construction Codes. The grantee shall strictly adhere to all building
and zoning codes currently or hereafter in effect. The grantee shall arrange
its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on both public and private property,
in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with the use of said
public or private property by any person. In the event of such interference,
the grantor may require the removal or relocation of the grantee's lines,
cables and other appurtenances from the property in question.
   (l)   Construction and Use of Poles.
      (1)   Whenever feasible, the construction, maintenance and use of the
grantee's cable system shall comply with the standards of materials in
engineering and all other provisions of a pole user agreement for use of poles,
entered into by and between other pole users and the grantee. In the event that
the grantee cannot obtain the necessary poles and allied facilities pursuant to
the provisions of such an agreement, and only in such event, then it shall be
lawful for the grantee to make all needed excavations in the streets for the
purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. All
poles of the grantee shall be erected between the curb and the sidewalk, unless
otherwise designated by the proper grantor authorities, and each pole shall be
set whenever practicable at an extension lot line. The grantor shall have the
right to require the grantee to change the location of any grantee-owned pole,
conduit, structure or other facility within the streets when, in the opinion of
the grantor, the public convenience requires such change, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the grantee.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall exempt the grantee from compliance with all
Charter and ordinance provisions relating to such excavations or construction,
or with any provision requiring payment of permit or license fees pertaining
thereto.
   (m)   System Design. The grantee's cable system shall comply with the design
and service requirements and schedules to be contained in the franchise
agreement, the exhibits attached to the franchise agreement and all applicable
laws and regulations. All of the grantee's construction and plans shall be
subject to the grantor's supervision and control, including, without
limitation, the location of facilities, the placement of poles and the
installation of underground facilities. The grantee shall submit construction
drawings and specifications for approval on all projects.
   (n)   Geographical Coverage. The grantee shall design and construct its
cable system in such manner as to have the capability to connect and provide
cable service to every single-family dwelling unit, multiple-family dwelling
unit, school, library and Municipal agency within the franchise area, provided
that any other cable provider should be required to do the same.
   (o)   System Upgrade Schedule.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with the requirements of the system
upgrade schedule to be contained in an exhibit of the franchise agreement.
      (2)   No less than thirty days prior to the start of construction in the
franchise area, the grantee shall meet all applicable design and construction
standards of the grantor and shall provide a detailed construction progress
schedule and area construction maps. In addition, the grantee shall update this
information upon request by the grantor on a quarterly basis, by submitting a
copy of its normal internal progress reports, showing specifically whether
schedules are being met and the reasons for any delay.
   (p)   Installation of New Cable System Underground. All new or upgrade cable
system facilities shall be installed underground where existing undergrounded
utility facilities exist, but may be installed on existing utility poles where
aerial facilities currently exist. In areas where no poles exist, the grantee
shall place its facilities underground, and the grantee shall move existing
facilities underground whenever all other utilities go underground.
   (q)   Prewiring. Any law of the grantor which requires prewiring of
subdivisions or other developments for electrical and telephone service shall
be construed to include wiring for cable systems.
   (r)   Undergrounding of Multiple-Dwelling Units. In cases of single-site
multiple- dwelling units, the grantee shall minimize the number of individual
aerial drop cables by installing multiple drop cables underground between the
pole and the dwelling unit where such installation is determined to be
technologically and economically feasible, in agreement with the owners and/or
an owner's association of the multiple-dwelling units. This section shall apply
only to newly constructed buildings or unwired existing buildings. The grantee
shall be required to install drop cables underground only if all other
utilities, including cable operators, are required to do the same at the time
of installation.
   (s)   Rights-of-Way Occupancy.
      (1)   With respect to aerial facilities, the grantee shall utilize
existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible and
economically feasible, and may not construct or install any new, different or
additional poles, conduits or other facilities on public property until the
written approval of the grantor is obtained.
      (2)   The grantee shall:
         A.   Locate and install all transmission lines, equipment and
structures so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners. However, the grantee shall retain the right to
determine, because of technical feasibility and technical reliability, where,
when, how and if equipment originally installed needs to be redesigned,
reconfigured or relocated;
         B.   Keep and maintain all transmission lines, equipment and
structures in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and
repair;
         C.   Employ professional care and install and maintain methods and
devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injuries or nuisances to the public;
         D.   Use suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices
as necessary for the safety of all members of the public;
         E.   Place any poles or other fixtures in any public right-of-way in
such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel of the right-of-way or
cause unsafe conditions of any sort; and
         F.   Comply with all local and State laws, rules and regulations
pertaining to traffic control.
      (3)   The grantee may not make paving cuts or curb cuts unless absolutely
necessary, and only after written permission and a street cut permit have been
obtained from the grantor, under such conditions as the grantor shall in its
reasonable discretion determine.
      (4)   The grantor may reasonably require conduit for underground cable in
areas specified by the grantor, said conduit to be provided at the grantee's
sole expense.
      (5)   Before beginning any excavation or other construction activity on a
public right-of-way or easement which crosses or abuts any private property,
the grantee shall clearly mark and delineate, with flags, stakes or non-
polluting water-soluble spray paint, the boundaries of that public right-of-way
or easement where it abuts or crosses the private property.
      (6)   In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley, easement,
public way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property, the
grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
grantor, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, easement, public
way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property to as good a
condition as it was before the work causing such disturbance was performed.
      (7)   The grantee shall locate, mark and map any of its installed cable
or the cable system for the grantor at no expense to the grantor. The cable
shall be installed so that it can be detected by the use of standard locating
devices.
   (t)   Completion of Work by Grantor. Upon the failure of the grantee to
commence, pursue or complete any work required by law or by the provisions of
the franchise agreement (other than completion of construction or rebuilding of
the cable system, which shall be governed by Section
753.29) or by any applicable permit, to be done in any public right-of-way or
public utilities easement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may, after notice to the grantee and
an opportunity to cure, cause the work to be done. The grantee shall pay to the
grantor the reasonable costs of the work in the itemized amount reported by the
grantor to the grantee, within thirty days after receipt of the itemized
report.
   (u)   Removal of Facilities. Upon receipt of written notice, the grantee, at
its own expense, shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove any of its property as necessary because of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, grade, separation or realignment or installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, transportation
facilities, tracks or any other type of structure or improvement.
   Nothing described in this subsection shall be considered a taking of the
property of the grantee, and the grantee is not entitled to additional
compensation because of these actions.
   The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the grantor, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit
the moving of any building or buildings. The grantee may require reasonable
advance payment for any such permittee prior to raising or lowering its wires.
   (v)   Stop Work.
      (1)   On notice from the grantor that any work is being prosecuted
contrary to the provisions of the franchise agreement or this chapter, or in an
unsafe or dangerous manner as determined by the grantor, or in violation of the
terms of any applicable permit, laws, regulations, ordinances or standards, the
work may immediately be stopped by the grantor if it involves a dangerous
condition or safety hazard; if not, the grantee shall be given a reasonable
time to cure.
      (2)   The stop-work order shall be:
         A.   In writing;
         B.   Given to the individual doing the work, or posted on the work
site; and
         C.   Sent to the grantee by overnight delivery at the address given in
the franchise agreement.
         Further, such stop-work order may:
         D.   Indicate the nature of the alleged violation or unsafe condition;
and
         E.   Establish conditions under which work may be resumed.
   (w)   Grantee's Contractors. The grantee's contractors shall be licensed and
bonded in accordance with the grantor's ordinances and regulations and the
requirements of all contractors working in the public rights-of-way. Any action
or omission of a contractor of the grantee which violates any provision of the
franchise agreement shall be considered an action or omission of the grantee
for the purposes of this chapter.
   (x)   Private Property. Except in the case of an emergency involving public
safety or service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the grantee
shall give reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to
entering upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to
be performed, provided that in the case of construction operations, such notice
shall be delivered or provided, when possible, prior to entry. If any damage is
caused by any grantee activity or omission, the grantee shall reimburse the
property owner the reasonable cost of the damage or replace or repair the
damaged property. For installation of pedestals or other major construction or
installation projects, property owners shall also be notified by mail at least
one week in advance. In the case of an emergency (as defined above), the
grantee shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal tenant in person
and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event personal contact is not made.
Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private
property or any other property where such right to access or entry is not
otherwise provided by law.
   (y)   Burial Standards.
      (1)   Depths. The grantee shall comply with the following burial depth
standards, unless local ordinances or the National Electrical Code standards
require a deeper minimum depth:
         A.   Cable drops from the pedestal shall be buried at a minimum depth
of eight inches.
         B.   Feeder lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         C.   Trunk lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         D.   Fiber optic cable shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen
to twenty-four inches.
      (2)   Timeliness. Temporary cable drops installed by the grantee to
residences shall be buried according to these standards within two calendar
weeks of initial installation. When freezing surface or other adverse weather
conditions prevent the grantee from achieving such timetable, the grantee shall
apprise the subscriber of the circumstances and the estimated time of burial,
and shall provide the subscriber, in writing, with the grantee's telephone
number and instructions as to how and when to call the grantee to request
burial of the line if the revised schedule is not met.
   (z)   National Standards. The grantor shall have the option of adopting any
national standards for the installation of optic fiber hereafter promulgated or
established.
   (aa)   Construction Standards.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable grantor construction
codes, including, without limitation, the Uniform Building Code, the Uniform
Fire Code, the Uniform Mechanical Code and the Electronic Industries
Association "Standard for Physical Location and Protection of Below-Ground
Fiber Optic Cable Plant," zoning ordinances and permit procedures. The grantor
may charge reasonable permit fees consistent with existing laws for upgrade
construction of cable plant. To move the upgrade construction process along,
the grantor agrees to process all applications, reviews, authorizations or
consents pertaining to permits, zoning issues, authorizations and consents in a
period not to exceed thirty days from written application or request to the
grantor. If the grantor fails to do so within said period, said request,
application, authorization or consent shall be deemed approved.
      (2)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all
applicable sections of Federal and State Occupational Safety and Health Acts,
and any amendments thereto, as well as all State and local codes and standards,
where applicable.
      (3)   All installation of electronic equipment shall be of a permanent
nature, durable and installed in accordance with the provisions of the National
Electrical Code, as amended, and all applicable State and local codes.
      (4)   Antenna supporting structures (towers) shall be designed for proper
loading as specified in the Electronics Industries Association's R.S. 222-
A specifications, as they may be amended from time to time. Antenna supporting
structures (towers) shall be painted, lighted, erected and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration and all other applicable state and local codes or regulations.
      (5)   Neither the grantee's plant and equipment, nor any work that the
grantee performs, shall endanger or interfere in any manner beyond reasonable
requirements, given the work the grantee is performing, with the rights of any
property owner, or hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (6)   The grantee shall at all times employ professional care and shall
install and maintain in use methods and devices to prevent failures and
accidents which risk damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   (bb)   New Residential Developments. In new residential developments in
which all the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the
following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of
underground easements:
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to
the terms and provisions of this chapter and any franchise agreement, may be
required) to provide cable service to that development. The developer may
establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve
the development.
      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared
basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the City any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled
to recover the cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that the
grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of the
date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed
to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall
have two working days to begin the installation of their cables and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         A.   It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         B.   It has received a written notification from each grantee that the
grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the
specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has received no reply
from a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which
case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating cable
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable, operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching or other burial
operation and associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition
which existed prior to such trenching or burial.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the City
reserves the right to reasonably require clustering of pedestals with other
utilities or franchisees.
   (cc)   Street Improvements. The grantor shall give grantees no less that
forty-five days advance notice (or notice as soon as possible in cases of
emergency) of street improvements or other activity which could affect the
cable system, including, but not limited to, street or public rights-of-way
excavation; construction repair; grading; traffic conditions; installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power or signal lines or tracks; or vacation or
improvement of public works.
      (1)   All such public works shall be done, insofar as possible, in such a
manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of the
poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the cable system.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person from liability arising out of
the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid interfering with cable system
facilities while performing the public works.
      (2)   If any equipment of the grantee shall interfere with public works,
then, upon receipt of the forty-five day notice, that part of the equipment of
the grantee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the grantee in
such manner as shall be directed by the grantor so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the grantor, and
the grantee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.
         (Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.20 TECHNICAL STANDARDS; TESTS.
   (a)   The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards, Federal Communications Commission technical standards and any
standards set forth in its franchise agreement.
   (b)   Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical
standards shall constitute a material franchise violation.
   (c)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all applicable
sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, as well
as all other applicable local, State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (d)   All installation of electronic equipment shall be installed in
accordance with the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code and the
National Electrical Code, as they may from time to time be amended.
   (e)   Antennae and their supporting structures (towers) shall be painted,
lighted, erected and maintained in accordance with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and all other applicable
local, State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (f)   All of the grantee's plant and equipment located within the franchise
area, including, but not limited to, the antenna site, the head-end and
distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wire,
coaxial cable, fixtures and appurtenances, shall be installed, located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained
and operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or
interfere with improvements that the City may deem appropriate to make or to
interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
   (g)   The grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures
and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the
public.
   (h)   The grantee shall, at the grantee's expense, perform the following
tests on its cable system:
      (1)   All tests required by the FCC;
      (2)   All other tests as otherwise specified in this chapter or the
franchise agreement; and
      (3)   All other tests reasonably necessary to determine compliance with
technical standards adopted by the FCC at any time during the term of the
franchise.
   The grantee shall maintain written records of all results of its cable
system tests, performed by or for the grantee. Such test results shall be made
available to the grantor upon request within two weeks.
   (i)   The grantee shall submit to the grantor, upon written request, within
sixty days after the activation of the new system, a detailed test plan
describing the methods and schedules for testing the cable system on an ongoing
basis to determine compliance with the provisions of the FCC technical
standards. The tests may be witnessed by representatives of the grantor, and
written test reports shall be available to the grantor upon written request.
The grantee shall provide the grantor with thirty days notice of the required
annual FCC proof of performance tests. In the event of any FCC test failures,
FCC procedures shall apply.
   (j)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the grantor
may require, where reasonable, additional tests, full or partial repeat tests,
different test procedures or tests involving a specified subscriber's terminal.
Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating any unresolved controversy or
noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular matter in
controversy. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such
special tests as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the grantee or the
subscriber. Failure to perform such properly requested additional tests within
thirty days shall constitute a material breach of the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.21 TRIMMING OF TREES.
   (a)   The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees, at its sole cost,
in accordance with all applicable utility, ordinance and easement restrictions,
upon and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the City,
so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the
wires and cables of the grantee. City representatives shall have authority to
supervise and approve all trimming of trees conducted by the grantee.
   (b)   Except in emergencies, the grantee may not prune trees at a point
below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written notice has
been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the street in or
over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this section, emergencies exist
when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from imminent danger of
immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or occupant shall have one
week from the receipt of the grantee's notice to arrange for an outside
contractor to prune the tree at his or her own expense. If the owner or
occupant fails to do so, the grantee may prune such tree at its own expense.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.22 PROVISION OF CABLE TO PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   The grantee shall provide one free standard installation and free monthly
expanded basic service, exclusive of premium, pay-per-view and a la carte
services, to the locations to be listed in an exhibit attached to the franchise
agreement, as well as to all newly constructed public facilities, during the
term of the franchise, plus two additional public facility locations selected
by the grantor. Such sites may also receive premium and pay-per-view services
at a cost not greater than that charged to residential subscribers for the same
service, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.23 INDEMNIFICATION OF CITY.
   (a)   The grantee, under any franchise operated pursuant to this chapter,
shall agree to indemnify, hold harmless, release and defend the City, its
officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, from and against any and
all lawsuits, claims, causes of action, actions, liability, demands, damages,
disability, losses, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
or liabilities of any nature, that may be asserted by any person, resulting or
in any manner arising from the action or inaction of the grantee, its
subcontractors, employees and agents, in constructing, operating, maintaining,
repairing or removing the system, in carrying on the grantee's business or
operations in the City, or in exercising or failing to exercise any right or
privilege granted by the franchise. This indemnity shall apply, without
limitation, to any action or cause of action for invasion of privacy,
defamation, antitrust, errors and omissions, theft, fire, violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent,
or any other right of any person, whether or not any act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or any franchise
agreement, but shall not include any claim or action arising out of the actions
or omissions of City officers, employees or agents or related to any City
programming or other access programming for which the grantee is not legally
responsible.
   (b)   The City shall promptly notify the grantee of any claims subject to
indemnification by the grantee and shall cooperate with all reasonable requests
by the grantee for information, documents, testimony or other assistance
appropriate to a resolution of such claims. The grantee shall have full
responsibility for and control of any action or undertaking directed at the
resolution of such claims.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.24 INSURANCE; CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION BOND; PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   The grantee shall provide insurance as specified in the franchise
agreement.
   (b)   With respect to the initial construction of the cable system, or any
significant project to upgrade or rebuild more than fifty percent of the cable
system, the grantee shall provide to the grantor a construction performance and
construction completion bond or a sufficient letter of credit (herein referred
to as the construction completion bond), with a surety and in such form as
reasonably approved by the grantor's Law Director, in an amount equal to ten
percent of the applicable estimated construction cost. Such amount, however,
shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). With respect to the
initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade or rebuild project,
when regular subscriber service is available to seventy-five percent of
occupied dwelling units, the amount of the bond shall be reduced by fifty
percent of the original amount. On the one-year anniversary of the initial
construction of the cable system or the upgrade or rebuild project, as the case
may be, the bond may be canceled.
   (c)   Within sixty days of the passage of the ordinance adopting the
franchise agreement, the grantee shall deposit with the grantor a surety bond
or a sufficient letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Law Director of the grantor
(hereinafter referred to as the performance bond). The performance bond shall
be available to insure the faithful performance by the grantee of provisions of
this chapter and the franchise agreement, other than with respect to
construction, upgrading or rebuilding projects covered herein, but including
the obligation to remove the above-ground portion of the cable system upon
revocation or termination of the franchise as set forth herein. The performance
bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) during the entire
term of the franchise agreement, regardless of withdrawals which may be made
under this section. In the event of a default by the grantee in any of its
obligations under the agreement, other than completion of construction, which
default is not cured within thirty days after notice by the grantor to the
grantee of such default (or such longer time as is necessary to cure, so long
as the grantee commences to cure within thirty days and diligently pursues
cure), the grantor may levy on the performance bond upon notifying the grantee
of the amount of such charge. The grantor may also levy upon the performance
bond for sums due for penalties under Sections
753.18(e) and
753.25(g). The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the performance
bond are in addition to all other rights of the grantor, at law or in equity.

all records relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to enable
the grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under local, State and
Federal law, this chapter and the franchise agreement. Such records include all
books, records, maps, plans, revenue statements, service complaint logs,
performance test results, records of requests for service and other like
materials of the grantee. The grantee shall have the right to be present at any
such examination.
   (d)   If any of the records described in this chapter or the franchise
agreement are proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by State,
Federal or local law, then, upon written request, the grantee shall have the
right to object to providing proprietary information except when necessary to
audit fees the grantee is required to pay the grantor hereunder. The grantor
agrees in good faith to attempt to resolve objections with the grantor. Such
information requested during an inspection shall be treated as confidential,
making it available for inspection purposes only to those persons who must have
access to perform their duties on behalf of the City, including, but not
limited to, the Division of Finance and the Law Department. To the extent that
any Federal requirement for privacy applies to the information to be submitted,
said law shall control.
   (e)   Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports
submitted by the grantee, or on behalf of or relating to the grantee, to the
Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
any other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction
with respect to any matters affecting the cable system authorized pursuant to
this chapter and any franchise, shall be made available to the grantor upon

relating to the operations of the grantee's cable system within the franchise
area. Grantee shall submit such documents to the grantor no later than thirty
days after the written request.
   (f)   One copy of all reports and records mentioned in this chapter or in

   (g)   The failure of the grantee to report or make information available
upon written request as specified and within the time limits stated in this
chapter or the franchise agreement shall, following notice and an opportunity
to cure, subject the grantee to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day.
The grantee's liability to the grantor for such amount in such cases shall not
be in lieu of, but in addition to, the remedies set forth in Section
753.99 for franchise violations. (Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.26 ANNUAL REPORTS.
   The grantee shall submit a written end of the year report to the grantor

year. Such report shall contain a summary of the previous year's activities in
the development of the cable system, including, but not limited to, services
begun or discontinued during the reporting year and improvements to the system.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.27 INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK; INTERCONNECTION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT NETWORKS.
   (a)   The grantee shall, at its cost, make available at an identified
location inside an exterior wall of the public facilities to be set forth in an
exhibit to the franchise agreement ("sites"), plus three additional facilities
designated by the grantor (which must be nonprofit institutions), two fibers,
in each case with not less than fifty feet of additional fiber extending inside
the facility ("institutional network"). Use of the fibers provided by the
grantee pursuant to this section will be limited to video and data
transmissions between and among the facilities described in this section and
any other facility attached to the institutional network under the terms of a
franchise between the grantee and the political subdivision in which such
facility is located. Any additional interior or exterior wiring or equipment
necessary to utilize the institutional network shall be at the cost of the
user. There shall be no cost to the grantor or the other designated sites for
the use and maintenance of the institutional network. In addition to the City,
the grantee may provide telecommunications services to residential and other
non-residential subscribers on such terms and at such rates as the grantee may
in its discretion determine.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if technically feasible, the grantee
shall interconnect the institutional network with other dedicated fiber,
limited access institutional networks provided by other cable operators for the
sole purpose of providing educational access programming between school
districts and emergency agencies consisting of video or data transmissions,
provided that such interconnections shall be limited to dedicated fiber,
limited access, institutional networks servicing the municipalities and school
districts to be listed in an exhibit to the franchise agreement and may
consider other such interconnections requested by the grantor, and provided,
further, that the grantee shall not be required to provide such an
interconnection to a network located in a municipality in which it does not
have a franchise. All costs associated with the construction of the
interconnections within the franchise area shall be the sole responsibility of
the grantee. There shall be no cost to the grantor or the other designated
sites for the use and maintenance of the institutional network. All other costs
shall be the sole responsibility of the requesting party or the other cable
operator.
   (c)   If the grantor or any of the sites has a presently existing network,
service on such network will not be unreasonably interrupted during the
building of the new system. (Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.28 EDUCATIONAL OR GOVERNMENT (E&G) ACCESS CHANNELS AND FACILITIES.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided by the franchise agreement, the grantee
shall, following completion of the system upgrade/rebuild, make available to
each of its subscribers who receive some or all of the services offered on the
system, reception of up to three educational and government (E&G) access
channels to be allocated among noncommercial, educational and government usage
as determined by the grantor. The channels designated for access shall be
provided by the grantee as a part of the basic cable service. The access
channels shall be made available by the grantee for use by the City and its
citizens in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the City or
any lawfully designated person, group, organization or agency authorized by the
City for that purpose.
   (b)   To the extent that any access channel is not being used for the
provision of non-commercial, educational or governmental access purposes, the
grantee shall be permitted to use such channel(s) for the provision of other
services, subject to any reasonable rules established by the City regarding
such use. The grantee's permitted use of any access channel made pursuant to
this section shall cease within ninety days of the grantee's receipt of notice
from the City that such channel will again be used for educational or
governmental access.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the above, the grantee may accommodate a request from
the City for additional access capacity made pursuant to Section
753.27(b) by combining more than one access use on a channel, provided that:
      (1)   It is technically and economically feasible for the grantee to do
so;
      (2)   The scheduling needs of all users of the channel can be reasonably
accommodated; and
      (3)   The access entity which requires use of the alternate channel must
be able to access the alternate channel from the site where it normally
originates playback of its programs and may not be required to transport tapes
to a remote site for playback.
   (d)   However, the grantee shall provide an additional channel for non-
commercial, educational or governmental broadcasts in the event that the three
E&G channels provided under this section are then fully utilized. In no event
shall the grantee be required to provide in excess of one additional access
channel, and only after the cable system offers at least 150 channels. As used
in this section, "fully utilized" means utilized for original, nonduplicative,
locally produced programming not less than eight hours per day, five days per
week, for a period of ten consecutive weeks. The additional E&G channel
provided under this section shall be reviewed annually by the grantee. Upon
such annual review, the additional E&G channel will continue to be made
available to the grantor to the extent that the E&G channels provided under
this agreement (including the additional PEG channel(s)) are at least seventy
percent fully utilized. To the extent that such capacity requirement is not
met, the additional E&G channel shall be terminated, subject to reactivation at
the request of the grantor upon demonstration by the grantor that the three
original and any other additional PEG channels provided under this section are
fully utilized, and to the annual review provided herein.
   (e)   The grantee shall provide free cable transmission facilities and free
modulation equipment to introduce programming onto these transmission
facilities by linking the below listed origination points with the head-end, or
through hubs to the head-end, for distribution to all subscribers generally and
for distribution to discrete audiences via scrambled signals and decoders at
the origination points for such channels.
   (f)   Costs of providing said facilities shall not be a credit against
payment of the franchise fee imposed under the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.29 FRANCHISE VIOLATION.
   (a)   If the grantor believes that the grantee has failed to perform any
obligation under the franchise agreement or this chapter or has failed to
perform in a timely manner, the grantor may make written demand on the grantee
that it remedy the alleged failure. The grantor may order the grantee to
correct or remedy the failure or breach within the time and in the manner and
on the terms and conditions that the grantor may reasonably establish. If the
alleged failure is denied or not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the
grantor, the grantor may follow any procedures set forth in the agreement.
   (b)   Penalties may be assessed by the grantor for purposes including, but
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure of the grantee to pay the grantor sums due under the terms
of the franchise.
      (2)   Reimbursement of costs borne by the grantor to correct franchise
violations not corrected by the grantee, after thirty days written notice.
      (3)   Monetary remedies, penalties or damages assessed against the
grantee due to default or breach of franchise requirements.
   (c)   Upon written notice and agreement of the grantor and the grantee, an
informal meeting may be held at any time to review any alleged failure.
   (d)   If the grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material
obligation required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following
notice from the grantor and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, the
grantor may act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following
procedures:
The grantor shall notify the grantee of any alleged material violation in
writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten days in
the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the
grantor under this chapter or the grantee's franchise and thirty days in all
other cases. If the grantee fails either to correct the violation within the
time prescribed, or to commence correction of the violation within the time
prescribed and thereafter diligently pursue correction of such violation, the
grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty days of a public
hearing to be held before the Council. Said notice shall specify the violations
alleged to have occurred. At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and
consider relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its decision. In
the event that the Council finds that a material violation exists and that the
grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner, or has not
diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the
grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the
Council may revoke the franchise or impose any other penalty permitted by the
franchise agreement and any other legal or equitable remedy available under the
franchise or applicable law. The grantee may appeal such decision of Council to
a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (e)   The grantor may assess against the grantee, after providing written
notice to the grantee and allowing thirty days or such other period of time as
is agreed upon by the grantee and the grantor to cure, monetary damages up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per calendar day or per incident for material
system upgrade or construction delays, and up to two hundred dollars ($200.00)
per calendar day or per incident for any other material breaches, provided that
all violations of a similar nature occurring at the same time shall be
considered as one incident. The grantor may have recourse to the performance
bond for payment of such damages, including the fifty dollar ($50.00) per day
penalty for failure to respond to the grantor's request for information due the
grantor within the time limits as specified in this chapter or the franchise
agreement pursuant to Section
753.25(g), and the one hundred dollars ($100.00) or five hundred dollars
($500.00) per day amounts for failure to timely pay the franchise fee pursuant
to Section
753.18(e), which shall not be subject to, but in addition to, the remedies set
forth in this section. The assessment of any monetary damages shall constitute
a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the
franchise or applicable law, including its right to recover from the grantee
any additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including attorney's and/or
consultant fees, that are incurred by the grantor by reason of the breach of
the franchise agreement that resulted in the assessment of such monetary
damages.
   (f)   In addition to revocation in accordance with other provisions of the
franchise agreement, the grantor may, after following the procedures set forth
in subsection (d) hereof, revoke the franchise agreement and rescind all rights
and privileges associated with the franchise agreement in the following
circumstances, each of which represents a material breach of the franchise
agreement:
      (1)   If the grantee fails to perform any of its material obligations
under the franchise agreement or under any ordinances, documents or other terms
and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the grantee;
      (2)   If there is a pattern of noncompliance with the grantor's consumer
service standards;
      (3)   If the grantee willfully and deliberately fails for more than
twenty-four hours to provide continuous and uninterrupted cable service for the
entire franchise area, not subject to force majeure, as set forth in Section
753.30;
      (4)   If the grantee intentionally practices any fraud or deceit upon the
grantor or any subscriber; or
      (5)   If the grantee intentionally becomes insolvent or if there is an
order for relief in favor of the grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.
   Written notice of intent to consider revocation under this subsection shall
be served on the grantee at least thirty days prior to the date of revocation.
The grantor shall hear any persons interested in the revocation and, within
ninety days after the hearing, shall determine whether to revoke the franchise
and declare that the franchise is revoked and the performance bond forfeited or
that the breach at issue is capable of being cured by the grantee. In the
latter case, the grantor shall direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial
action within the time, in the manner and under the terms and conditions that
the grantor determines are reasonable under the circumstances. The grantee may
appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 1997-19.
Passed 4-28-98.)
753.30 FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE'S INABILITY TO PERFORM.
   In the event that the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions
or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee's control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events
not within the control of the grantee shall include, without limitation, acts
of God, strikes, sabotage, riots, civil disturbances, restraints imposed by
order of a governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities,
explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes, landslides, and fires. In the event that any such delay in
performance or failure to perform affects only part of the grantee's capacity
to perform, the grantee shall perform to the maximum extent it is able to do so
and shall take all steps within its power to correct such cause(s). In
correcting such cause(s), the grantee shall take all reasonable steps to do so
in as expeditious a manner as possible. The grantee shall notify the grantor in
writing of the occurrence of an event covered by this section within five
business days of the date upon which the grantee learns of its occurrence.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.31 ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL OF FRANCHISE PROPERTY.
   (a)   In the event that the use of any property of the grantee within the
franchise area or a portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of
twelve months, the grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise
property.
   (b)   The grantor, upon such terms as the grantor may impose, may give the
grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or
equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the
franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities
and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and shall restore
any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and
equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and
places in as good a condition as they were prior to such removal without
materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility
wires, poles or attachments. The grantor shall have the right to inspect and
approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires,
attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance provisions of this chapter and any performance bond provided in the
franchise shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal
and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
section.
   (c)   Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the grantee, if
required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument,
satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership
of the franchise property abandoned.
   (d)   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or
upon its revocation or earlier expiration as provided for herein, in any such
case without renewal, extension or transfer, the grantor shall have the right
to require the grantee to remove, at its own expense, all above-ground portions
of the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the City
within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180 days. The
indemnification and insurance provisions and the performance bond shall remain
in full force and effect during the period of removal.
   (e)   If the grantee fails to complete any removal required by this section
or any other work required by law within the time limits set by the grantor
after the date of written notice and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the
grantor may cause the work to be done and:
      (1)   The grantee shall reimburse the grantor for the reasonable costs
incurred within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs; or
      (2)   The grantor may recover the costs through the performance bond
provided by the grantee.
   The grantor may also seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the
provisions of this section.
   (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter,
the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as
it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or public rights-
of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public
utility or other cable grantee.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.32 EXTENDED OPERATION AND CONTINUITY OF SERVICES.
   Upon either expiration without renewal or revocation of the franchise, the
grantor shall have discretion to permit and/or require the grantee to continue
to operate the cable television system for an extended period of time not to
exceed six months from the date of such expiration or revocation, unless
further extended by mutual agreement of the grantee and the grantor. The
grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service
and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.33 RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.
   (a)   A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the grantor,
cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or
trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership or
trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all the faults under the
franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such faults which is
satisfactory to the grantor; and
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.
   (b)   In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary or judicial sale of
the franchise property, or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve
notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale,
in which event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the
grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such
notice, unless:
      (1)   The grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as
and in the manner that this chapter provides; and
      (2)   Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.
         (Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.34 RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.
   (a)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
chapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required
to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   (b)   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by Federal or State regulation, if the grantor
determines that it is in the public interest to do so and that the enforcement
of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the
subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of
any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision
subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of
the franchise unless the statement so recites.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.35 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (a)   The grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender or
sexual preference. The grantee shall comply at all times with all other
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations relating to
nondiscrimination.
   (b)   The grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local regulations.
   (c)   Neither the grantee nor any other person shall, without the
subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping of any cable line, signal
input device or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine
maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service and polling with
audience-participating or audience-viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (d)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's
right of privacy, as defined in the Cable Act, or other personal rights,
through the use of the system, as such rights are delineated or defined by
applicable law. The grantee shall not, without a lawful court order or other
applicable valid legal authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way
equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any
subscriber or general citizen.
   (e)   The grantee shall not sell or otherwise make available to unaffiliated
third parties (including the grantor) lists of the names and addresses of
subscribers, any list which identifies, by name, subscriber viewing habits, or
any personalized data pertaining to a subscriber's use of any of the
franchisee's services, without the express written consent of the subscriber to
which the personalized data pertains. For the purposes of this subsection,
"personalized data" shall mean the name and address of an individual subscriber
directly associated with data obtained on his or her use of specific services
provided by or through the grantee. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent, as a normal incident of commercial enterprise, the sale or
availability of nonpersonalized or aggregated data which are not personalized
data, as defined herein.
   (f)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter or other piece of equipment
owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the subscriber's
premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any
required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
the subscriber's property shall be presumed. Where a property owner or his or
her predecessor has granted an easement, including a public utility easement or
a servitude, to another, and the servitude by its terms contemplates a use such
as the grantee's intended use, the grantee shall not be required to obtain the
written permission of the owner for the installation of cable television
equipment.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.36 TIME LIMITS STRICTLY CONSTRUED.
   Whenever the franchise agreement sets forth a time for any material act to
be performed by the grantee, such time shall be deemed to be of the essence,
and any failure of the grantee to perform within the allowed time may be
considered sufficient grounds for the grantor to invoke any relevant penalty
provision of the franchise agreement or this chapter in accordance with the
provisions of Section
753.18(e), 753.25(g) or 753.29, as applicable.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.37 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The grantor shall be vested, to the extent permitted by law, with the
power and right to regulate reasonably the exercise of the privileges permitted
by the franchise agreement in the public interest, or to delegate that power
and right, or any part thereof, to any agent, City officer or employee or
established board, authority or commission, provided, however, that the
establishment of any such board, commission or authority, or the delegation of
such authority to any City employee or agent, shall not relieve the grantor,
acting through its City Council, of its ultimate authority and responsibility
as grantor hereunder, and provided, further, that all final determinations
required hereunder to be made by the grantor shall be made by the City Council
as provided by law.
   (b)   The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply,
promptly and completely, with any provision of the franchise by any failure of
the grantor to promptly enforce compliance with the franchise.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98;)
753.38 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and a
franchise agreement entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this chapter
shall control, except as may be specifically otherwise provided in the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.39 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter, or any franchise agreement executed
subject to it, is held by any court, or by any Federal, State or county agency
of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or
State law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such
court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the
requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be
considered a separate, distinct and independent part of this chapter, and such
holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other
provisions hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect for the
term of any franchise agreement or renewal or renewals thereof. In the event of
such determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, the grantor or the
grantee shall have the option to amend the parts of the franchise agreement
related to the affected sections. In the event that such law, rule or
regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed,
so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall
thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on
the grantor and the grantee, provided that the grantor shall give the grantee
sixty days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said
provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for the
grantee to comply with such provision. (Ord. 1997-19. Passed 4-28-98.)
753.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for
each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.

be issued only after a cash deposit has been posted with the Director,
satisfactory to the Director as to amount and in all other respects, and
conditioned upon the prompt and satisfactory refilling of all excavations and
restoration and cleaning up of all surfaces used or disturbed. The Director may
also require liability insurance or a bond in such amount and with such surety
as he shall deem necessary, conditioned to safeguard the Municipality from any
liability for injuries or damages which might occur from the opening,
excavation or work. Upon completion of all the work the applicant shall post a

excess materials therefrom within the time specified in the permit, or where
not specified therein, within a reasonable time after commencement of the work,

the difference between the deposit and the reasonable charges of the
Municipality for restoration services performed by it. If the amount of the
services performed by the Municipality should exceed the amount of the deposit,

public trees as may be necessary to insure public safety or to preserve or
enhance the symmetry and beauty of public sites. The Department of Public

shall intentionally damage, cut or carve, whether above or below ground, or
transplant or remove, any public tree; attach any rope, wire, nails,
advertising poster or other contrivance to any public tree; allow any gaseous
liquid or solid substance which is harmful to trees to come in contact with any
public tree; or set a fire, or permit any fire to burn, when such fire or the
heat therefrom will injure any portion of any public tree. No person shall pour
salt water or a chemical or chemicals upon any street in such a way as to

growing thereon, except by written approval of the Director of Public Service
or the Forester.
(Ord. 1996-25. Passed 4-23-96.)

   (a)   All public trees located near any excavation or construction of any
building, structure or street work shall be guarded with a good substantial
fence, frame or box not less than four feet high, placed at the dripline. All
laborers and all building materials, dirt or other debris shall be kept outside
this barrier. The Department of Public Service may permit a variance in cases
where the barrier would impede the flow of traffic on a public street, private
street or driveway and where the dripline overhangs a building or permanent
structure.
   (b)   No person shall excavate any ditches or trenches within the dripline
of a public tree, or lay any drive within fifteen feet of a public tree,
without first obtaining the written approval of the Director of Public Service
or the Forester.
(Ord. 1996-25. Passed 4-23-96.)
904.18 PRUNING OF PUBLIC TREES BY PUBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES.
   Public utility companies shall notify the Director of Public Service prior

standards. If accepted arboricultural standards are not followed, the Director
of Public Service will immediately file a formal complaint with the Public
Utilities Commission.

904.19 WAIVING OF CHAPTER REQUIREMENTS DURING EMERGENCIES.
   In the case of officially declared emergencies, such as windstorms, ice
storms, or other disasters, the requirements of this chapter may be waived so

of Public Service.
(Ord. 1996-25. Passed 4-23-96.)
904.20 MOVING OF BUILDINGS AND OBJECTS.

   No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with Department of
Public Service personnel while such personnel are engaged in executing or
enforcing this chapter on public or private property, provided, however, that
nothing herein shall be construed as an attempt to prohibit the pursuit of any
remedy, legal or equitable, in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
protection of property rights by the owner of any property within the
Municipality.
(Ord. 1996-25. Passed 4-23-96.)
904.22 LICENSING OF TREE SERVICES; REQUIREMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.

         (Ord. 2006-70. Passed 11-14-06.)
905.05 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities. All Facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Whenever possible according to acceptable engineering standards and
consistent with Federal and State Law regarding safety and other matters,
facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible underground duct or
conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within such Facility.
      (2)   A Service Provider other than a public utility operating under a
tariff issued by the State of Ohio and regulated by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio with permission to install Overhead Facilities shall install
its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles only, and then
only if Surplus Space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a Service
Provider with permission to occupy the same Public Right-of- Way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities, must also
locate its Facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein other than a
public utility operating under a tariff issued by the State of Ohio and
regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio which may require above
ground facilities for operational reasons, no Facilities shall be located above
ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express written permission of the
Mayor.
      (5)   The City reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the City’s goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way.
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and the City reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other Service Providers would likely
construct Facilities in the future, the City may require the Service Provider
to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with Excess Capacity in the
Public Right-of-Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by another Service Provider. The Service Provider
may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional
conduit space as reimbursement. This requirement shall not apply where no
practical operational, engineering or safety standard would support the need
for excess capacity.
   (c)   City Owned Conduit.  If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Service Provider’s proposed Facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible for the Service Provider’s Facilities to Occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the City, the Service Provider shall be required to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the City in order to reduce the necessity to
Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Service Provider shall pay to the City a
fee for such Occupancy in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Ohio
R.C. 4939.05. The City and the Service Provider may agree to amortize the fee
through annual payments to the City.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within one hundred twenty(l20)
days, or more for larger projects, following written notice from the City, and
receipt of final design plans and a construction schedule from the City, and a
signed contract agreement between the Public Utility and the City if
reimbursement is due from the City, a Service Provider shall submit design
plans and a proposed construction schedule to the City to temporarily or
permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any Facilities in
the Public Right- of-Way whenever the City shall have determined that such
removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any City or other public improvement in or upon the Public
Right-of- Way.
      (2)   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the Public Right-of-Way.
      (3)   With regard to the expense of such removal or relocation, the
standard for reimbursement to the service provider for such expense shall be in
accordance with State Law and regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any Service Provider or other Person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or
shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City.
After the thirty (30) days have expired, the City may remove the Facilities or
appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way at the other party’s expense. A
System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider’s consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way of the
City, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and in accordance with State or Federal Law or regulations;
      (4)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (5)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the City’s
consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction Permit;
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section

1111.10 to be dedicated or deeded to the City for public park or recreational
uses, the requirements of Section
1111.10 shall not be applicable to such subdivision and there shall be no
requirement that land must be dedicated or deeded to the City for public park
or recreational uses as a condition precedent to the approval of a subdivision
by the Commission.
(Ord. 1973-74. Passed 10-23-73.)
1111.10 MANDATORY DEDICATION OF AREA FOR PARK AND RECREATION USES.
In the interests of public safety, health and welfare, to provide proper open
spaces for circulation of light and air and to avoid future congestion of
population detrimental to the public safety, health and welfare, no subdivision
plat shall be approved by the City Planning Commission, except as provided in
this section and Sections
1111.09 and
1111.11 unless, in addition to all other lawful requirements, after deducting
the area of such subdivision to be dedicated or deeded for public street,
sidewalk or utility purposes, seven percent of the balance of the area of such
subdivision is dedicated or deeded to the City for public park or recreational
uses. However, the area to be so dedicated or deeded to the City for public
park or recreational uses must be reasonably suitable, in the judgment of the
Commission, for use as a public park or recreational area. In determining such
reasonable suitability, the Commission shall consider such factors as the
topography of the area to be so dedicated or deeded, the major physical
characteristics of such area, the location thereof in relation to the remaining
area of the subdivision, the shape of the area to be so dedicated or deeded and
other similar considerations as in the judgment of the Commission are relative
to a determination of whether or not the area to be so dedicated or deeded can
reasonably be used for public park or recreational purposes.
(Ord. 1973-74. Passed 10-23-73.)
1111.11 EXCEPTIONS; CONSIDERATIONS.
Notwithstanding the requirement of Section
1111.10, the City Planning Commission shall have authority to determine that it
would not be adverse to the interests of public safety, health and welfare to
provide proper open spaces for circulation of light and air and the avoidance
of future congestion of population detrimental to the public safety, health and
welfare, to approve a subdivision plan wherein less than the minimum area
required by Section
1111.10 is dedicated or deeded to the City for public park or recreational uses
when it is further determined by the Commission, after such public notice and
hearing, that it would be unreasonable to require the minimum area as set forth
in Section
1111.10 to be so dedicated or deeded and that practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardship would result from such requirement. In making such
determination, the Commission shall consider such factors as the following:
   (a)   The aggregate area of the subdivision after deducting the area to be
dedicated or deeded for public street, sidewalk or utility purposes;
   (b)   The topography of the subdivision;
   (c)   The major physical characteristics of the land within the area of the
subdivision;
   (d)   The aggregate area of the subdivision, after deducting the area to be
dedicated or deeded for public street, sidewalk or utility purposes, which can
reasonably be developed for uses authorized under the Zoning Code;
   (e)   The uses which may be made of the proposed subdivision under the
Zoning Code and the density of population which reasonably would result from
such permitted uses;
   (f)   The proximity of existing public park or recreational areas with
consideration given to whether or not such existing public park or recreational
areas would reasonably satisfy the need for public park and recreational areas
within the proposed subdivision;
   (g)   Proposed deed restrictions and setback lines;
   (h)   Other exceptional conditions as in the judgment of the Commission are
relative to a reasonable determination of the area of land to be dedicated to
the City for public park and recreationaluses.
(Ord. 1973-74. Passed 10-23-73.)
1111.12 ALTERNATE REQUIREMENT IN THE CASE OF SMALL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Recognizing that in certain cases, subdivisions may be of such a minimum
area that it would be unreasonable under any circumstances to require any land
therein to be dedicated or deeded to the City for public park or recreational
areas, neither Section
1111.10 or
1111.11 shall apply. In such cases, in lieu of setting aside lands for park and
recreation purposes, the developer shall deposit with the City moneys in an
amount equal to five hundred dollars ($500.00) per lot of such subdivision.
Such moneys shall be deposited in a special account for land development.
maintenance and land acquisition for park and recreation purposes.
(Ord. 1978-118. Passed 2-13-79.)
1111.13 GRADING AND SEEDING LANDS ALLOCATED FOR PUBLIC USE.
   In those cases where land is allocated to public use as provided in Section
1111.09 or is to be dedicated or deeded to the City for public park or
recreational uses pursuant to Section
1111.10, the owner of the proposed subdivision, prior to approval of the
subdivision plan, shall grade such area and plant it with grass seed of such
quality and character, and in such amount, as is reasonably suitable for park
or recreational uses, or in lieu thereof, he may furnish a 100 percent
performance bond in an amount to be determined by the City Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1973-74. Passed 10-23-73.)
1111.14 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Performance Standards and Compliance.
      (EDITOR'S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 2008-20, all of Section 1111.14,
except subsection (a)(3) thereof was repealed.)
      (3)   If the City, due to extraordinary circumstances, and upon approval
of Council, requires a developer to substantially increase the requirements of
retention set forth in paragraph (a)(l) hereof, the City may enter into an
agreement through the Mayor with the developer under the following conditions:
         A.   If the increased requirement is due to projected run-off from
other properties tributary to the proposed retention facility, which properties
will benefit directly therefrom, a protective ordinance stipulating the amount
of benefit to such properties, based on a prorated amount determined on an area
basis, will be adopted, so that when such areas are developed, compensation can
be made to the developer of the enlarged facility.
         B.   Approval of any development plan which has been assigned a
benefit to an expanded retention facility shall be subject to the agreement by
the developer to compensate the developer of the expanded retention facility in
an amount equal to the computed amount developed in paragraph (a)(3) A. hereof.
         C.   The developer of such expanded retention facility shall either:
            1.   Give the City clear title to this retention basin, reserving
to himself or herself the right to use this area for zoning or recreation
purposes; or
            2.   Grant the City an easement over this retention basis and such
access facilities that may be necessary to provide for its use by the
designated benefitting properties.

Passed 2-27-90; Ord. 1990-146. Passed 10-9-90; Ord. 1994-9. Passed 3-22-94.)
1111.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of this chapter, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and each day
during which such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

1309.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Basic Building Code, as adopted in Section
1309.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units. (OAC 4101:2-1-05)

(Ord. 1994-3. Passed 2-22-94; Ord. 2001-3. Passed 1-9-01.)
1323.03 METHOD OF ESTABLISHING GRADE.
   Yard grades are to be established throughout the Municipality by the
Engineer. The Engineer will be paid for his or her services at the rate of
three hundred eight dollars ($308.00) per yard grade and at the rate of eighty
dollars ($80.00) for reinspection per yard grade required because of
nonconformity by the owner and/or contractor.
   In establishing the yard grade the Engineer shall take the following factors
into consideration:
   (a)   The overall area grading plan;
   (b)   The grade of the streets on which the lot or the land exists; in the
event that the street is not then in existence, the grade of the street as
proposed;
   (c)   The existing grade and/or contour of the lot and/or contour of
adjacent properties;
   (d)   The setback and location of the proposed building or structure on the
lot;
   (e)   Any other physical factors usually considered in conformity with good
engineering and construction practices.
   The Engineer shall indicate the yard grade as determined by him or her by
means of suitably marked stakes set near the property sideline at locations to
be determined by the Engineer. The Engineer shall in addition, indicate the
yard grade or other reference mark on some nearby fixed object such as a
telephone pole or fireplug. The Engineer shall also pick and approve the
elevation of the first floor joist plate of the proposed building or structure,
in accordance with the plans submitted by the owner and/or contractor. Such
elevation shall not be in excess of 24 above the highest point of the yard
grade at the building as established by the Engineer except in the case of
split level designed houses, in which event such elevation shall not be in
excess of 48 inches above the highest point of the yard grade.
(Ord. 1994-3. Passed 2-22-94; Ord. 2001-3. Passed 1-9-01.)
1323.04 GRADE REQUIRED FOR BUILDING PERMIT.
   (a)   The yard grade and elevation of the first floor joist plate as
determined by the Engineer shall become a part and condition of the building
permit issued by the Building and Zoning Director for the proposed building or
structure, and the building or structure shall conform and be constructed in
accordance with these conditions. The owner and/or contractor shall not
continue with the construction of the building until an inspection is made by
the Engineer of the footer forms prior to pouring of the footer, of the
completed foundation, of the first floor joist plate and of the final grade. If
upon each inspection by the Engineer it is found that such construction
conforms to the approval granted, then permission will be given to proceed. If,
however, the owner and/or contractor has varied from the established grade and
plate elevation, then the owner and/or contractor must pay an additional permit
fee of one hundred ninety dollars ($190.00). He or she must then make the
necessary corrections to conform to the established grade and plate elevation
before any further work will be permitted.
(Ord. 1994-3. Passed 2-22-94; Ord. 2001-3. Passed 1-9-01.)
   (b)   The Engineer shall also inspect the yard grade after completion of
landscaping and shall verify that it conforms to the established grade. In the
event that the Engineer determines upon final inspection after landscaping that
the owner and/or contractor has varied from the established grade, the owner
and/or contractor shall make the necessary corrections to conform to the
established grade.

or where the structural barrier is mounted on the top of the pool structure and
the means of access is a ladder or steps, then the ladder or steps shall be
surrounded by a structural barrier or shall be capable of being secured, locked
or removed to prevent access.
   (c)   Where a wall of a dwelling serves as part of the structural barrier,
all doors with direct access to the pool through that wall shall be equipped
with an alarm which produces an audible warning when the door and its screen,
if present, are opened. The alarm shall sound continuously for a minimum of
thirty seconds immediately after the door is opened and be capable of being
heard throughout the house during normal household activities. The alarm shall
automatically reset under all conditions. The alarm shall be equipped with a
manual means, such as a touchpad or switch, to temporarily deactivate the alarm
for a single opening. Such deactivation shall last for not more than fifteen
sounds. The deactivation switch(es) shall be located at least 54 inches (1372
mm) above the threshold of the door.

therefor shall be deducted from the required deposit. Charges are to include
labor, material, equipment and time, to and from the job site. Time is to be
computed from the departure from the service garage to the job site and back

thousand dollars ($1,000), the depositor shall immediately make an additional
deposit so that the full amount of the required original deposit is maintained.

additional deposit, the Director of Public Service or the Building Inspector
shall stop all further grading, excavating or construction work on the property
until such additional deposit is made.

Zoning Code.
   The ten dollar ($10.00) and/or twenty-five dollar ($25.00) permit fee shall
be payable and deducted from the deposit provided for in Section
1335.01 at the time the permit is issued and represents the costs to the City
of making inspections while the work progresses.

1349.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Middleburg Heights has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted. (Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-
10.)
1349.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its pmposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood-waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.04 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Middleburg Heights as identified in Section
1349.05, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by City
of Middleburg Heights.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.05 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:

by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 15700 Bagley Road, Middleburg Heights,
Ohio.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.06 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.07 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.08 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Middleburg Heights, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)
1349.09 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-9-10.)

any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).   
      Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community
depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).

Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation.
      The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway:
      A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.
      A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure:
      Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.
      An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State
of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
      A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
         A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends
the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific
property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
         A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and
floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a
LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded
from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
         A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project
complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain
management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor.
      The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.
      A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes an mobile homes as
defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park.
      As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured
home park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes
used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes,
and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
      The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal Government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal Government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction.
      Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after
the initial effective date of the City of Middleburg Heights Flood Insurance
Rate Map, August 17, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (27)   Person.
      Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.

      A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.
      A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.
      A person registered as a professional engineer under Ohio Chapter 4733 of
the Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.
      A person registered as a professional surveyor under Ohio Chapter 4733 of
the Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area.
      Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH,
AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are

including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.
      The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.

restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.
      Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance.
      A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent with
the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.
      The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with these regulations. (Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed 11-

and other data
showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1349.24, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail. (Ord. 2010-63. Passed 9-28-10; Ord. 2010-80. Passed
11-9-10.)
1349.22 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.

a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of “bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Middleburg Heights specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1349.20(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1349.24(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 14 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Middleburg
Heights.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. fu considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1349.24(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1363.01 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   It is hereby determined that the system of streams and wetlands within
Middleburg Heights contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of its
residents. The purpose of this Riparian and Wetland Setback Ordinance is to
assist in the preservation of water quality within the streams of Middleburg
Heights and to help protect residents of the City from property loss or damage
because of flooding or other impacts of the stream. This ordinance will further
the following objectives:
   (a)   Protect the receiving stream's physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics and to maintain stream functions.
   (b)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of
floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
   (c)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of streams and wetlands to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream and
wetland banks.
   (d)   Reduce pollutants in streams and wetlands by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter streams and
wetlands.
   (e)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
   (f)   Benefit Middleburg Heights economically by minimizing encroachment on
stream channels and reducing the need for costly maintenance and repairs to
roads, embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and
storm water management practices that are the result of inadequate storm water
control due to the loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
   (g)   Protect and maintain the native vegetation of riparian and wetland
areas by implementing specifications for the establishment, protection and
maintenance of vegetation along streams and wetlands within Middleburg Heights
jurisdiction.
      (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.02 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

ordinance shall not relieve the owner from the responsibility for conditions or
damages that may result from a failure to comply, and shall not result in the
City of Middleburg Heights, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting from a failure to comply with
applicable requirements. (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)

that:
      (1)   It will not reduce wetland functions or functional performance;
      (2)   The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing
physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils,
or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and
would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
      (3)   The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no
less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and
      (4)   The buffer width is not reduced to less than 75% of the standard

         (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.09 PROCEDURE FOR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if
applicable). A photocopy of the applicable section of each map will be attached
to the permit application.
      (2)   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the City or the applicant to believe that an unmapped wetland exists
on or within 120 feet of the project site the applicant will retain a Qualified
Wetland Professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or
wetland buffer areas. If after such evaluation, no wetland or wetland buffer
areas are found, the applicant shall submit a letter from the Qualified Wetland
Professional with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying his or
her negative findings.
   (b)   New residential or commercial or other type development and projects
involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change: Upon filing a
request for approval of a preliminary plat or building permit for new
residential, commercial or other type of development that involves changes in
any parcel boundaries or changes in and use, the applicant or his or her
designated representative shall retain a Qualified Wetland Professional to
survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If no wetlands are found,
the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit a letter
with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying that a Qualified
Wetland Professional has surveyed the site and found do wetlands. The City may
waive the requirement to perform a survey if the applicant demonstrates to the
City's satisfaction that no wetlands are within 120 feet of the project site.
   (c)   If wetlands are found during either of the reviews set forth above,
the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   A Qualified Wetland Professional, acceptable to the City of
Middleburg Heights Engineer, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA Category
2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed
development site using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method
for wetland evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation.
Acceptance of this determination shall be subject to approval by the City of
Middleburg Heights Engineer
      (2)   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel split plans,
land development plans, and/or permit applications submitted to the City of
Middleburg Heights.
         A.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
City of Middleburg Heights, using delineation protocols accepted by the US Army
Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this
regulation. If conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two
agencies, the delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of
wetland shall apply.
         B.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and bounds,
or higher level, survey subject to approval by the City of Middleburg Heights.
      (3)   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate wetland setbacks on the
development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed, and such
delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
      (4)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City prior to
delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
   (d)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision/property/parcel
split, commercial development or other land development or improvement,
riparian and wetland setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records
for the City of Middleburg Heights and shall be maintained as open space
thereafter through a permanent conservation easement. A third party, not the
landowner or permittee or the City of Middleburg Heights, which is allowed by
state law, shall be given the conservation easement. If no third party will
accept the conservation easement, the City of Middleburg Heights shall accept
it and protect it in perpetuity.
(Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.10 MITIGATION FOR IMPACTS TO RIPARIAN AREAS AND WETLAND SETBACK AREA.
   (a)   If an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that intrusion within the delineated Riparian Setback boundary is
necessary to accomplish the purposes of a project, then the applicant must
provide mitigation for that impact. The applicant shall develop a plan for
mitigation and submit it to the City Engineer for review and approval. For a
plan to be approvable it must meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   Mitigation for an impact will be required based on the location of
the intrusion. The closer the intrusion to the stream, the more mitigation that
will be required. The Riparian Setback area for the stream corridor calculated
in accordance with the method specified in Section
1363.07(a) shall be divided into two zones. Zone 1 extends from 0 to 25 feet
from the stream edge; Zone 2 extends from 25 feet to the outer edge of the
setback corridor. Intrusion into these zones will require the following
mitigation within the same Watershed Assessment (Unit 14-digit) HUC scale:
         A.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than four
times the total area disturbed in the stream and within Zone 1 of the site
being developed shall be mitigated within Zone 1 of the mitigation location. At
least a fourth of the mitigation area shall be mitigation in the form of stream
restoration in accordance with guidelines developed by the City of Middleburg
Heights. The remaining mitigation can be in the form of restoration or
protection.
         B.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than three
times the area disturbed within Zone 2 of the site being developed shall be
mitigated within Zone 1 and/or 2 of the mitigation location.
      (2)   All mitigation shall, at a minimum include conserved or restored
setback zone, and should be designed to maximize the ecological function of the
mitigation. Including mitigation at the stream edge along with associated
setback areas is one way to maximize ecological function. The applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the mitigation
provided will have equivalent or greater ecological value than the riparian
area impacted by the project. Mitigation shall be protected in same manner as
existing Riparian Setback areas under this ordinance.
   (b)   If an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that intrusion within the delineated wetland setback is necessary to
accomplish the purposes of a project, then the applicant must provide
mitigation for that impact. The applicant shall develop a plan for mitigation
and submit it to the City Engineer for review and approval. For a plan to be
approvable it must meet the following minimum requirements.
      (1)   Mitigation for an impact will be required based on the location of
the intrusion, the closer the intrusion to the wetland, the more mitigation
that will be required. The Wetland Setback area for a wetland which is
calculated in accordance with the method specified in Section
1363.08(a) of this ordinance shall be divided into two zones. Zone 1 extends
from 0 to 25 feet from the wetland edge and Zone 2 extends from 25 feet to the
outer edge of the setback area. Intrusion into these zones will require the
following mitigation within the same Watershed Assessment Unit (14-digit) HUC
scale:
         A.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than four
times the total area disturbed within Zone 1 of the site being developed.
         B.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than two
times the area disturbed within Zone 2 of the site being developed.
      (2)   The mitigation may include buffer zone or wetland restoration or
enhancement. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that the mitigation provided will have equivalent or greater
ecological value than the riparian area impacted by the project. Mitigation
shall be protected in same manner as existing Wetland Setback areas under this
ordinance.
         (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.11 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   By-Right Uses Without A Permit: The following uses are permitted by
right within the Riparian and Wetland Setbacks without prior approval, provided
they are not prohibited by any other applicable law. Open space uses that are
passive in character shall be permitted in Riparian Setbacks, including, but
not limited to, those listed in these regulations. No use permitted under these
regulations shall be construed as allowing public trespass on privately held
lands.
      (1)   Recreational Activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, state, and local laws, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, picnicking,
and similar uses. Structures associated with recreational activity, including
limited boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas are permitted.
      (2)   Removal of Damaged or Diseased Trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed. Because of the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than 6 inches in diameter shall be anchored to the shore or removed
from the 100 year floodplain.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or Reforestation. Riparian and wetland setbacks
may be revegetated with non-invasive plant species.
      (4)   Maintenance of lawns, gardens and landscaping. Lawns, gardens and
landscaping that existed at the time this ordinance was passed may be
maintained as long as they are not increased in size.
      (5)   Removal of deposited flood debris. The accumulation of flood debris
within a channel can exacerbate potential flooding problems. The City reserves
the right to, at any time, enter a stream area to remove deposited flood
debris. Care shall be taken to ensure that the disturbance to the riparian
setback is minimized during these events.
      (6)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities. Storm
water facilities may be allowed within the Riparian Setback and Wetland Setback
if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
   (b)   By-Right Uses With A Permit. The following uses are permitted within
the Riparian and Wetland Setbacks with prior approval of the design by the City
of Middleburg Heights Engineer, provided they are not prohibited by any other
applicable law:
      (1)   Selective harvesting of timber. Selective harvesting of timber may
be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a Qualified Forester and accepted by the City of Middleburg Heights
Engineer.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a one
thousand dollar ($1,000) performance guarantee with the City of Middleburg
Heights. This performance guarantee shall be in the form of a Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Certified Check or Cash, and it shall be held until completion
of the timber-harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than 6 inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into sections no longer
than 6 feet or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Harvested trees or felled
logs and branches that are part of a designed and approved Stream bank
Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to remain in a
designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. "Adequately stocked" shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B-Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the forest City of
Middleburg Heights to be harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
high water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees and fire
wood from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            5.   Specify the erosion control Best Management Practices that
will be employed during and after the proposed harvest. These erosion control
practices shall be in conformance with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Forestry's BMPs for Erosion Control on Logging Jobs in
Ohio.
            6.   Provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers and the associated permit
requirements.
      (2)   Stream bank stabilization and erosion control measures. Stream bank
stabilization and erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical. The stream bank
stabilization and erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of a Storm Water Control Plan by the City of Middleburg Heights
      (3)   Crossings. Crossings of streams and through Riparian Setbacks by
publicly and privately owned roads, drives, sewer and/or water lines and public
and private utility transmission lines shall only be allowed upon approval of a
Crossing Plan by the City of Middleburg Heights Engineer. Such crossings shall
minimize disturbance in riparian setbacks stream substrate and shall mitigate
any necessary disturbances. Soil erosive materials will not be used in making
stream crossings. Such crossings must also comply with applicable state and
federal law, including U.S. Army Corps of Engineer and/or Ohio EPA permits, if
such permits are required.
      (4)   Construction of fencing. Construction of fencing shall be allowed
with the condition that reasonable efforts be taken to minimize the destruction
of existing vegetation, provided that the fence does not impede stream or flood
flow, and the disturbed area is replanted to the natural or preexisting
conditions before the addition of the fence, as approved by the City of
Middleburg Heights Engineer.
      (5)   Dredging. Dredging may be allowed to be performed for the potential
purpose of flood control. In order for the City to approve of dredging of an
open channel, a hydrologic/hydraulic engineering study must first be performed
and approved by the City Engineer; and that this study indicates that the
dredging of a particular watercourse will help minimize future flooding
problems. In addition, the dredging activity must be accordance with all
applicable state and federal law.
         (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)

   (a)   A non-conforming use within a Riparian and/or Wetland Setback which is
in existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the use
shall not be changed or enlarged unless it is permitted under these
regulations. For example, the existing building footprint or roofline may not
be expanded or enlarged in such a way that would move the structure closer to
the stream or wetland.
   (b)   If damaged, destroyed or discontinued, a non-conforming structure or
use may be repaired or restored within two years from the date of damage/
destruction/discontinuation or the adoption of these regulations, whichever is

ordinary repairs to a residence or residential accessory building that are not
in conflict with other provisions in this regulation.
   (c)   In the case of a non-conforming structure within a riparian or wetland
setback, the City of Middleburg Heights will allow a ten (10) foot maintenance
access zone measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend
further into the setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is
minimized and vegetation is restored to the pre-existing state, as near as
practical, upon completion. If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as
part of any such maintenance activity, a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers or the Ohio EPA, as appropriate, must be submitted prior to the onset
of the soil disturbing activity.
   (d)   In the case of a non-conforming residential structure, the City of
Middleburg Heights Engineer may allow minor upgrades to the structure that
extend further into the riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious decks/
patios, provided the modifications do not extend more than ten (10) feet
further toward the stream or wetland than the original foundation of the
structure existing at the time of passage of this regulation, and further
provided that the modification will not impair the function of the riparian
zone nor destabilize any slope nor stream bank, as determined by the City of
Middleburg Heights Engineer. Expansions larger than ten (10) feet must be
obtained through the variance process.
   (e)   In the case of existing dedicated City roadways within the riparian
setback, the City of Middleburg Heights reserves the right to enter into the
riparian setback to perform typical activities associated with the operation
and maintenance of roadways. These activities include, but are not limited to,
salt application during freezing temperatures, road and shoulder stabilization,
repair and/or replacement of existing guardrail, the construction of new
guardrail based upon safety concerns, and the widening of pavement or bike
paths, based upon traffic studies. The City shall ensure that disturbance to
existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is restored to the
preeexisting state, as near as practical, upon completion.
   (f)   In the case of existing hydraulic structures, such as storm conduits
and culverts, within the riparian setback, the City of Middleburg Heights
reserves the right to enter into the riparian setback to perform typical
activities associated with the operation and maintenance of these structures.

maintenance and repair of structures, and the replacement of structures.
Additionally, if supported by a proper engineering study, the City reserves the
right to increase the size of any hydraulic structure within the riparian
setback, or add to the structure to improve the hydraulic function of the
structure, such as adding a headwall to a culvert. The City shall ensure that
disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is restored to
the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon completion.
   (g)   In the case of existing utilities within the riparian setback, the
City of Middleburg Heights reserves the right to grant permission to utility
companies to enter into the riparian setback to perform typical activities
associated with the inspection, maintenance, replacement, of any and all
existing utilities within the riparian setback. The utility company shall
ensure that disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is
restored to the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon completion.
(Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.14 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The City of Middleburg Heights through the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals may grant a variance from this regulation as provided herein.
In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty
such as to justify the granting of a variance, the City of Middleburg Heights
shall consider the potential harm or reduction in stream and/or wetland area
functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use. The City of
Middleburg Heights shall also consider in determining whether to grant a
variance whether the severity of the burden imposed by this regulation upon an
individual's property rights would constitute a taking without just
compensation under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United
States Constitution.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the City of Middleburg Heights
shall consider the following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where gravel or porous
pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and similar products) would be practicable and
feasible.
   (c)   In making a variance determination, the City of Middleburg Heights may
consider the following:
      (1)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the City of Middleburg Heights's flood damage prevention regulations may be
used as guidance when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the City of Middleburg Heights.
      (6)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (7)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.
      (8)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (9)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
      (10)   In the case of a lot made unbuildable or to which no economically
viable use exists as a result of this regulation, consider the minimum variance
needed to make it buildable or restore economic viability for an appropriately
sized and compatibly designed structure, while following the guidance provided
in this section.
      (11)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flood or
erosion damage to either the applicant's property or to other properties.
      (12)   Culverting of streams should be avoided.
      (13)   Whether the variance will result in the need for artificial slope
or bank stabilization measures that could interfere with the function of the
riparian zone.
         (Ord. 2008-19. Passed 2-26-08.)
1363.15 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or his or her designated representative disputes the
boundary of a Riparian or Wetland Setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant of his or her designated representative shall submit
documentation to the City of Middleburg Heights which describes the boundary,
the applicant's proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed boundary
change.
   (b)   The City of Middleburg Heights shall evaluate this documentation and
shall make a written determination within a reasonable period of time, not to
exceed sixty (60) days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant. If

1367.10 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Erosion Control Practices: The Storm Water Control Plan must make use
of erosion controls that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils
unless an exception is approved by the City of Middleburg Heights in accordance
with Section
1367.16. A description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed
areas after grading or construction shall be included in the Storm Water
Control Plan. The Storm Water Control Plan must provide specifications for
stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide guidance as to
which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of the year. Such
practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, matting,
sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations, use of construction entrances and use of alternative ground cover.
      (1)   Stabilization - Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
the tables below:
Table 1: Temporary Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Temporary Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any disturbed areas within 50 feet of a Within two days of the most recent
stream and not at final grade           disturbance if the area will remain

Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent
year or more                            disturbance
Any areas within 50 feet of a stream    Within two days of reaching final grade
and at final grade
Any other areas at final grade          Within seven days of reaching final
                                        grade within that area
 
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels- Person(s)
implementing the Storm Water Management Plan shall undertake special measures
to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent erosive flows. Measures may
include seeding, dormant seeding (as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development), mulching, erosion control matting, sodding,
riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering techniques or rock check
dams.
   (b)   Runoff Control Practices. The Storm Water Control Plan shall
incorporate measures that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as
to prevent erosion. Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope
drains, diversions to direct flow away from exposed soils and protective
grading practices. These practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed
areas and steep slopes where practicable.
   (c)   Sediment Control Practices. The Storm Water Control Plan shall include
a description of structural practices that shall store runoff, allowing
sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or otherwise
limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used to control
erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14
days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt
fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels
which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond and storm inlet protection. All
sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be
considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not
considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
   (d)   Structural Practices:  The Storm Water Control Plan must contain
detail drawings for all structural practices. The structural practices shall
also meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up Slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond. For common drainage locations that serve an area with 10 or more
acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond
must be provided until final stabilization of the site. The applicant may
request approval from the City of Middleburg Heights to use alternative
controls if it can demonstrate the alternative controls are equivalent in
effectiveness to a sediment settling pond and Ohio EPA approved the alternative
control. For drainage locations serving less than 10 acres, smaller sediment
basins and/or sediment traps should be used.
   The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic yards
of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining the
total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is not co-mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling pond must be
less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one
unit of width (> 2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the
sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour. Other sediment barriers designed to control sheet flow runoff
may be used if approved by the City of Middleburg Heights and allowed by Ohio
EPA. The relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a
particular slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Stormwater diversion
practices shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep
slopes. Such devices, which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm
water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
Table 3
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of silt fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    >2% but <20%
0.125                                   >20% but <50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection. Other erosion and sediment control practices
shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water entering active storm drain
systems, unless the storm drain system drains to a sediment settling pond.
      (5)   Stream protection. If construction activities disturb areas
adjacent to streams, structural practices shall be designed and implemented on
site to protect all adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff. No
structural sediment controls (e.g., tile installation of a silt fence or a
sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a stream. For all
construction activities immediately adjacent to surface waters of the State,
the applicant must comply with applicable setback requirements.
      (6)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
      (7)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid (other than sediment) or
liquid waste, including building materials, shall be discharged in storm water
runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent
the discharge of non-sediment pollutant to the drainage system of the site or
surface waters of the State. Under no circumstances shall concrete trucks wash
out directly into a drainage channel, storm sewer or surface waters of the
State. No exposure of storm water to waste materials is recommended.
   (8)   Off-Site traffic. Off-site vehicle tracking of sediments and dust
generation shall be minimized.
      (9)   Compliance with other requirements. The Storm Water Control Plan
shall be consistent with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary
sewer, or septic system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste
disposal by open burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of
contaminated soils located within the development area.
      (10)   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no turbid
discharges to surface water or wetlands resulting from dewatering activities.
If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a sediment-
settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device, prior to
being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment may be
removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter bag or
comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain sediment or
other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. However,
care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it does not
become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other pollutant
sources.
         (Ord. 2008-18. Passed 2-26-08.)
1367.11 POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Storm Water Control Plan will also contain the following information
depending on the size of the development sites as well as any additional
information, required by the City of Middleburg Heights engineer.
   (a)   General Requirements:  All Storm Water Control Plans must contain the
following information pertaining to post-construction water quality control:
      (1)   A description of the post-construction BMP(s) that will be
installed during the construction for the site and the rationale for their
selection. The rationale must address the anticipated impacts on the channel
and floodplain morphology, hydrology, and water quality.
      (2)   Detail drawings must be provided for all post-construction BMP(s).
   (b)   Development Sites Smaller than Five Acres: A development site that
will disturb one (1) or more, but less than five (5) acres of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
      (1)   A description of measures that will be installed during the
construction process to control pollutants in storm water discharges that will
occur after construction operations have been completed.
      (2)   Structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree
attainable.
      (3)   The Storm Water Control Plan shall include an explanation of the
technical basis used to select the practices to control pollution where flows
exceed predevelopment levels.
      (4)   Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow
velocity from the structure to water course so that the natural physical and
biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected (e.g., no
significant changes in the Hydrological regime of the receiving water).
   (c)   Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger: A development site that disturbs
five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5) acres, but is
a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will disturb five
(5) or more acres of land shall identify:
      (1)   Post Construction Water Quality Storage: The Post-Construction BMP
(s) chosen must be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the
stream channels, stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
      (2)   Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
      (3)   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of
the two following methods:
         A.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local municipal
permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-
term hourly precipitation records or
         B.   Using the following equation:
   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet C =
runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (see Table 1) P =
0.75 inch precipitation depth
         A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
      (4)   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
      (5)   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA and the City
Engineer.
      (6)   BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below.
Table 2: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction
Treatment Control Practices
 
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration                                24-48 hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 hours
Retention Basins (Wet Basins)*              24 hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 hours
 
   *Provide both a permanent pool and water quality volume above the permanent
pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQv 
      (7)   The owner may request approval from the City of Middleburg Heights
Engineer to use alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the
alternative structural post-construction BMPs have been approved by Ohio EPA
pursuant to the currently effective Ohio EPA NPDES Construction Activity
General Permit or an individual NPDES Permit issued by Ohio EPA.
      (8)   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post- Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan.
      (9)   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
(Ord. 2008-18. Passed 2-26-08.)
1367.12 STORM WATER QUANTITY CONTROL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.
   In addition to the information contained in the SWP3, the applicant shall
submit supplemental information regarding post development runoff as part of
the Storm Water Control Plan. The Storm Water Control Plan shall describe how
the proposed storm water management practices are designed to meet the
following requirements for storm water quantity for each watershed in the
development:
   (a)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all more
frequent storms occurring under post-developmentl conditions shall not exceed
the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the
same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
   (b)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
   (c)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area shall
be determined as follows:
      (1)   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the City
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a l-year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the development drainage area before and after development. These
calculations shall meet the following standards:
         A.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used for
full build out as proposed.
         B.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing watershed
to the development area.
         C.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect the
average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current land
use.
         D.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description.
      (2)   From the volume determined in Section 1367.l2(c) (1) determine the
percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the percentage
select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:

1367.13 INSPECTIONS AND MAINTENANCE.
   All temporary and permanent control practices developed in accordance with
an approved Storm Water Control Plan shall be maintained and repaired in
accordance with the approved Inspection and Maintenance Agreement and as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function. All sediment
control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until all slope
areas they control are permanently stabilized. Any portion of the permanent
water quality management systems, including on-site and off-site treatment/
storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will be continuously
maintained into perpetuity. All maintenance plans must meet the following
standards and those responsible for implementation of the maintenance plan must

structural Post- Construction BMP practices are disposed of in accordance with
local, state and federal guidelines.
   (b)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the owner of the site to both
the City of Middleburg Heights Engineer and the post-construction operator of
the BMP (including homeowner associations) upon completion of construction
activities and prior to the City of Middleburg Heights Engineer giving final
approval for the completed construction.
   (c)   Single-Family Residential Developments: A Homeowners' Association or
other entity acceptable to the City Engineer shall be created and placed in
title of the affected lands and shall be continuously responsible for post-
construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless such
maintenance and inspections become officially accepted by the City of
Middleburg Heights.
   (d)   Multi-Family, Commercial and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless such
maintenance and inspections become officially accepted by the City of
Middleburg Heights.
   (e)   Maintenance Design: Low maintenance requirements are a priority in the
design and construction of all facilities. Multi-use facilities incorporating
assets such as aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of
the drainage facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment
control, water quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-
site structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be
inspected and maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in
the plans and the requirements of this chapter. Inspections and maintenance
will be incorporated periodically throughout the year to ensure that the
facilities are properly operational.
   (f)   Permit Related Inspections: All controls on the site shall be
inspected in accordance with the applicable individual NPDES Construction
Activity Permit or Ohio EPA's NPDES Construction Activity Permit #OHC000002.

least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period until no longer required
under the applicable Ohio EPA storm water control permit.
   (g)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Building Department for review by the City Engineer or their designee by May
1st of each and every year after the Best Management Practice (BMP) has been
completed. The City Engineer retains the authority to require that the annual
inspection report be a written and stamped report from a professional engineer
or other individual possessing a valid state license that authorizes them to
design the type of BMP inspected.
   (h)   Structures that Require a Permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
   (i)   Repair and Maintenance: If an inspection reveals that a control
practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a sediment
settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three days of the
inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within 10
days of the inspection.
   (j)   Authority of the City to Perform Corrective Actions: The City of
Middleburg Heights is authorized to enter upon the property and to perform the
inspections or any necessary corrective actions if the landowner(s), person, or
organization responsible for maintenance does not make the required inspection
or correction within the specified time period in the maintenance plan or
within a reasonable amount of time where no time period has been specified. The
City of Middleburg Heights shall be reimbursed by the landowner(s), person, or
organization responsible for maintenance for all expenses related to inspection
or correction incurred by the City within ten (10) days of receipt of invoice
from the City.
   (k)   Modification of the Selected Control Practice: If an inspection
reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended function and that
another, more appropriate control practice is required, the Storm Water Control
Plan must be amended by the person or entity responsible for maintenance and
the new control practice must be installed after receiving approval from the
City Engineer. If an inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the person or entity responsible for installation must request approval
from the City Engineer to no longer implement the planned control practice.
   (l)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
City of Middleburg Heights Building Department by May 1st of each year into
perpetuity. These reports will document if restricted plantings, fences and
structures are on the easement and will identify the location of the noted
easement restriction violations. (Ord. 2008-18. Passed 2-26-08.)
1367.14 EASEMENTS.
   Future access to all permanent vegetative and/or mechanical post-
construction water quality conservation practices (BMPs) and other areas, as
required by the City of Middleburg Heights Engineer, shall be secured by means
of easements.
   (a)   Easements shall be approved by the City Engineer and shall be recorded
with the Cuyahoga County Auditor and on all property deeds.

maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance agreement for the site.
   (d)   Easements to structural storm water management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspection and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the City of
Middleburg Heights. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a
maintenance easement may be removed by the City of Middleburg Heights at the
property owner’s expense.
      (Ord. 2008-18. Passed 2-26-08.)
1367.15 FEES.

1367.16 PERFORMANCE BOND OR SECURITY.
   Unless the requirement is waived by the City Engineer, if a Storm Water
Management Plan is required by this regulation, soil-disturbing activities
shall not be permitted until a performance bond or security has been deposited
with the City of Middleburg Heights. The performance security or bond shall be
posted for the City of Middleburg Heights to perform the obligations otherwise
to be performed by the owner of the development area as stated in this

      (Ord. 2008-18. Passed 2-26-08.)
1367.17 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   Where the City of Middleburg Heights Engineer determines that site
constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to
improve the management of storm water runoff as established in this chapter,
practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality
and/or a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping
with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be
required to meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical
alternatives shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed
development project. Practical alternatives must be approved by the City
Engineer and can include, but are not limited to:
   (a)   Fees paid in an amount specified by the City of Middleburg Heights
Engineer. The City of Middleburg Heights shall apply these fees to storm water
management practices that improve the existing water quality.

1121.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE ZONING CODE.
   (a)   The purpose of this Zoning Code and the intent of Council in its
adoption is to promote and protect to the fullest extent permissible under the
provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, and as modified by the City Charter, the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort and prosperity and the general
welfare of the City, by regulating the use of buildings, other structures and
land, for residences, public facilities, businesses, services, industries or
other purposes; by regulating and restricting the bulk, height, design, percent
of lot coverage and location of buildings; and by regulating and limiting
population density; and, for the aforesaid purposes, to divide the land within
the City into districts of a certain number and dimensions and to provide
procedures for the administration and the amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   This Zoning Code is intended to achieve, among others, the following
objectives:
      (1)   To protect the character and values of residential uses,
institutional and public uses, business, commercial and manufacturing uses, and
to ensure the orderly and beneficial development of such uses.
      (2)   To provide adequate open spaces for light, air and outdoor uses.
      (3)   To prevent overcrowding of the land.
      (4)   To prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and other
vegetation.
      (5)   To prevent excessive concentration of population and, on the other
hand, to prevent sparse and uncoordinated development.
      (6)   To regulate and control the location and spacing of buildings on a
lot and in relation to the surrounding property.
      (7)   To regulate the location of buildings and intensity of uses in
relation to streets according to plans so as to cause the least interference
with, and be damaged least by, traffic movements, and hence result in lessened
street congestion and improved public safety.
      (8)   To establish zoning patterns that will ensure economical extensions
for sewers, water supply, waste disposal and other public utilities, as well as
the development of recreation and other public facilities and schools.
      (9)   To provide the regulatory framework necessary to implement the
development and re-development goals set forth in the City Comprehensive Master
Plan.
      (10)   To accomplish the specific intents and goals set forth in the
respective chapters of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1121.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS OF THE ZONING CODE.
   (a)   Zoning Code Authority. The authority for the preparation, adoption,
and implementation of this Zoning Code is derived from Ohio Revised Code
Chapters 711 and 713, which permits the adoption of uniform rules and
regulations governing the zoning and subdivision of land, and by the Charter of
the City of Middleburg Heights.
   (b)   Reference to the Ohio Revised Code. Whenever any provision of this
Zoning Code refers to or cites a section of the Ohio Revised Code (as amended),
and that section is later amended or superseded, this Code shall be deemed
amended to refer to said amended section or the section that most nearly
corresponds to the superseded section.
   (c)   This Zoning Code enumerates only those uses which are permitted in the
various zoning districts. If a particular use is not included in the list of
permitted uses for a particular zoning district, it shall be interpreted as not
permitted.
   (d)   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare.
   (e)   If the provisions of this Zoning Code require a greater width or size
of yards or other open spaces, a lower height of a building or structure, fewer
stores, a greater percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied or a more
restricted use of land, or impose higher standards than are required in any
other ordinance, regulation, private deed restriction or private covenant, the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall govern, but if the requirements of the
other ordinance, regulation, deed restriction or private covenant are more
restrictive, then those requirements shall govern.
   (f)   Conflicts Between Zoning Code Text. If any requirement or regulatory
provision of this Zoning Code is found to be inconsistent with any other, the
more restrictive or greater requirement shall be deemed, in each case, to be
applicable.
   (g)   The title and chapter headings in this Zoning Code have been inserted
for convenience in reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope
of, or otherwise affect, any provision of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)

applicant requests an administrative waiver by the Building Commissioner from
the standards of this Code.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner may grant administrative waivers for any
area or dimensional regulation that does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
applicable minimum or maximum regulation unless specifically prohibited in this
Code. Area and dimensional regulations include, but are not limited to, minimum
front, side, and rear yard setbacks; maximum height of structures, etc.

request that exceeds ten percent (10%) or other variations from this Code that

   (d)   Administrative Waiver Review Procedure. The review procedure for an
administrative waiver shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.
         A.   An applicant shall submit a request for an administrative waiver
on an application form provided by the Building Commissioner.
         B.   An application for an administrative waiver may be submitted
simultaneously with a Development Plan review or other required application
required under this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Step 2 - Building Commissioner review and decision.
         A.   For applications not filed simultaneously with another zoning
application, the Building Commissioner shall review the administrative waiver
application within thirty days after the application (Step 1) is determined to
be complete.
         B.   For applications that are filed simultaneously with another
zoning application, the Building Commissioner shall review the administrative
waiver application and make a decision within the timeframe established for the
related Development Plan review or other zoning application review.
         C.   In reviewing the application, the Building Commissioner shall, at
a minimum, consider the standard of review criteria set forth in this Section.
         D.   In making a decision on the administrative waiver, the Building
Commissioner may approve or deny the application and shall provide written
documentation of the decision to the applicant.
         E.   Planning Commission Referral. The Building Commissioner may refer
the administrative waiver to the Planning Commission, for any reason, to
request assistance in determining the reasonableness of an administrative
waiver request. When the application is referred to the Planning Commission,
the final decision to approve or deny the administrative waiver application
shall be the responsibility of the Planning Commission and shall be processed
as a regular agenda item.
   (e)   Standards of Review for Administrative Waivers. Any Building
Commissioner and Planning Commission decision on an administrative waiver
request shall be based on consideration of the following criteria serving as
the standard of review:
      (1)   The waiver will allow the proposed development to reflect the
predominant development character of the surrounding area, similar uses and
properties (e.g., similar setbacks, similar sign areas, etc.).
      (2)   Special circumstances exist that make the precise compliance with
the subject standards impractical or unreasonable.
      (3)   The waiver request is minor in nature.
      (4)   The waiver request does not substantially deviate from prior
issuances of BZA variances or the development character of the surrounding
properties; and
      (5)   The waiver request does not deviate from the overall purpose of
this Zoning Code, any applicable planning documents or the intent and objective
of the original regulation.
   (f)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a building
permit within one year of the date the administrative waiver was approved or
the approval shall expire.
      (2)   Upon expiration of an administrative waiver approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
administrative waiver may be reviewed.
   (g)   Effect of an administrative waiver approval.
      (1)   The issuance of an administrative waiver shall authorize only the
particular modification approved in the application.
      (2)   An administrative waiver, including conditions, shall run with the
land and shall not be affected by change in property ownership.
      (3)   Development activity authorized by an administrative waiver shall
not be carried out until the Applicant has secured all other approvals required
by this Zoning Code or any other applicable provisions of the City.
      (4)   An administrative waiver shall not ensure subsequent approval for
other applications for development approval unless the relevant portions of
this Code or other applicable provisions are met.
   (h)   Amendment of an Administrative Waiver after a Decision. An
administrative waiver may be amended, extended or modified only in accordance
with the procedures and standards established for its original approval.
   (i)   Reapplication.
      (1)   No application for an administrative waiver, which has been denied
wholly or in part by the Building Commissioner, shall be resubmitted within one
year of such denial, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof,
which the Building Commissioner deems sufficient to justify reconsideration.
      (2)   A substantial modification of a request for an administrative
waiver may be submitted as a new application, however, without regard to the
one year limitation.
      (3)   Before ruling on the new application, the Building Commissioner
shall first determine if the modification of the request is substantial.
   (j)   Appeals. If an application for an administrative waiver is denied, the
applicant may appeal the decision by following the administrative appeals
procedure set forth in Section 1127.08.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)

receives a request for approval of a Development Plan, a conditional use
permit, a determination of a similar use, or an application for a subdivision,
the Commissioner shall, within ten days, cause a sign to be posted upon the
site which is the subject matter of such request, indicating upon such sign
that Planning Commission action has been requested in connection with such
site, and further indicating the time and dates of the regular meetings of the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)

development related approval as provided in this Zoning Code for the purpose of
exclusive use, in common, by abutting or other owners or occupants of the land.
   (b)   Required common land elements may include, but not be limited to: a
street, recreation area, or any other active or passive open area or other

across the street from, such parcel or parcels to the addresses of such owners
appearing on the County Auditor’s current tax list or the County Treasurer’s
mailing list.

hearing shall be mailed by the Clerk of Council, by first class mail, at least
fifteen days before the date of the public hearing, to the owners of property
within and contiguous to and directly across the street from such parcel or
parcels, to the addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor’s
current tax list or the Treasurer’s mailing list, and to such other persons who
or which may be specified by Council. The failure of delivery of such notice
shall not invalidate any such ordinance, measure or regulation.
      (4)   On-site posting required. Within ten days prior to the required
public hearing before Council held as a result of a request for a zoning
district change upon application of a property owner or as a result of a PMU

filed with the Building Commissioner upon the forms provided by the City, and
shall be accompanied by the following requirements necessary to convey the
reason(s) for the requested area variance:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s).
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority.
      (3)   Description of property or portion thereof.

   (d)   Public Hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing as set forth in Section
1127.03  to consider each area variance application.
   (e)   Area Variance Standards of Review. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
review each application for an area variance to determine if it complies with
the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and Comprehensive Master Plan based
on sufficient evidence demonstrating that the literal enforcement of this Code
will result in a practical difficulty. A practical difficulty exists whenever a
zoning standard unreasonably deprives a landowner of a permitted use of their
property. All of the factors set forth in this section do not need to be
satisfied; rather, they shall be weighed together in the analysis as part of a
balancing test. The factors to be considered and weighed in determining whether
a property owner seeking an area variance has encountered practical
difficulties in the use of their property include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions.
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the area
variance.
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures.
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the area variance.
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, and trash pickup.
      (6)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions.
      (7)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner.
      (8)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than an area variance.
      (9)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting an area variance.
   (f)   Request for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to adequately review and evaluate the request for an area variance.
   (g)   Area Variance Conditions. In authorizing an area variance, the Board
of Zoning Appeals may apply such conditions regarding the location, character
and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in
the interest of furthering the purposes of this Zoning Code, furthering the
public interest and in support of the Comprehensive Master Plan. In authorizing
an area variance with attached conditions, the Board may require such evidence
or statements, as it may deem necessary, that the conditions attached are and
shall be complied with. Specifically, the Board may attach one or more of the
following conditions to an area variance:
      (1)   Paving.
      (2)   Landscaping and/or other screening fence or wall.
      (3)   Amount and location of off-street parking, loading and signs.
      (4)   Direction and intensity of outdoor illumination.
      (5)   Cleaning and painting.
      (6)   Performance standards intended to control or eliminate or reduce
smoke, dust, radiation, gas, noise or odor.
      (7)   Hours of operation.
      (8)   Outdoor storage.
      (9)   Other conditions as may be deemed appropriate and necessary by the
Board to adequately satisfy the applicable standards of review.
   (h)   Final Approval of Area Variances by City Council. Any action by the
Board of Zoning Appeals in granting an area variance concerning the height of a
building or structure, or concerning the minimum lot area per dwelling unit,
shall not become effective until such decision has been referred to City
Council and has been approved by City Council after considering the standards
of review set forth in this section.
   (i)   Withdrawal or Change of an Area Variance. An area variance, once
granted, shall not be withdrawn or changed unless there is a substantial change
of circumstances, or, if after the expiration of one year, no substantial
construction is undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions under
which such area variance was granted. In such circumstances, the Building
Commissioner shall provide the applicant with written notice of the
noncompliance. Upon failure to fully comply with the area variance requirements
within thirty days of receiving the notice, the area variance shall be deemed
null and void and all regulations governing the parcel and land use(s) in
question shall revert to those in effect before the area variance was granted.
   (j)   Violation of Area Variance Conditions. If the area variance is
approved with conditions, the Board shall include the list of specific variance
conditions upon which the variance was granted within the documented minutes of
the public hearing meeting. Violations of such conditions shall be enforced in
the following manner:
      (1)   Upon a finding that one or more area variance conditions have not
been satisfied, the Building Commissioner shall notify the applicant of the
violation in writing by certified mail.
      (2)   The applicant shall have thirty days from the receipt of the notice
of violation to fully satisfy the area variance condition(s).
      (3)   Failure to satisfy the condition(s) within the thirty day period
shall result in the revocation of the area variance approval.
   (k)   Approval Time Limit. Approved area variances that are not fully acted
upon within twelve months shall be considered null and void.
   (l)   Final Decision. If an area variance application has been denied by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, the applicant shall have the right to appeal the
decision under the administrative appeals process as set forth in Chapters 2505
and 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. After the applicant has exhausted all
available appeals rights, the denial shall be considered a final decision and
no application on the same matter may be accepted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.

all districts are as shown on the officially adopted Zoning Map which
accompanies original Ordinance 1982-170, passed March 22, 1983. No buildings or
premises shall be erected or used except in conformity with the regulations
prescribed for the use districts in which such buildings or premises are

   The boundaries of the zoning districts are shown on the Official Zoning Map
which is hereby adopted and made a part of this Zoning Code. The Zoning Map and
all notations, references and such Zoning Map and all notations, references and
other information shown thereon were fully set forth and described in this
Zoning Code. The Zoning Map designation and the regulations which accompany the
Map are also declared to be a part of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1129.03 ZONING MAP INTERPRETATION.
   If uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   The district boundaries are the centerlines of streets or alleys,
unless otherwise shown, and where the districts designated on the Zoning Map
are bounded approximately by street or alley centerlines, such centerlines
shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts.
   (b)   If the zoning district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and the
property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines. If the districts
designated on the Zoning Map are bounded approximately by lot lines, such lot
lines shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts, unless the
boundaries are otherwise indicated on the Zoning Map.
   (c)   In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the Zoning
Map shall be determined by dimensions or the use of the scale appearing on the
Zoning Map.
   (d)   If the above rules do not clarify the subject zoning district
boundary, the Planning Commission shall have the authority to review and
interpret the disputed boundary. The person contesting the location of the
zoning district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
their case to the Commission and to submit technical evidence.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1129.04 ZONING OF VACATED PROPERTY.
   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action
of Council, the zoning of the district adjoining each side of such street,
alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of
such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall henceforth be subject
to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1129.05 ZONING OF ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   All territory which may be annexed to the City shall continue in its
existing zoning classification until amended in accordance with the procedures
outlined in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1129.06 GENERAL LAND USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   A building or parcel of land may be used, and the use of a building
and parcel of land may be changed or extended, and an existing building may be
altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or maintained, only for the
uses specifically identified or referred to as permitted or required in the
district in which the building or parcel of land is located and for no other
use. The identification of land uses within a zoning district shall not be
construed as a ranking of the most desirable to the least desirable uses.
   (b)   Permitted Uses. Main buildings and land uses identified in the Land
Use Matrix Chart as set forth in Section
1129.07 , shall be permitted by right as the principal building, use or
activity of a parcel only in a zoning district in which it is specifically
permitted.
   (c)   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses are certain types of land uses so
classified in this Zoning Code because of their uncommon or unique
characteristics, large land area requirements or for other reasons. They are
uses which cannot be permitted by right but which are permitted in specific
zoning districts in which they are appropriate and compatible with certain
conditions and regulations applied. The uses which may be considered for
conditional approval in specific zoning districts are identified in the Land
Use Matrix Chart as set forth in Section
1129.07 . The procedures and standards for evaluating and approving conditional
uses are set forth in
Chapter 1143 .
   (d)   Accessory Buildings and Uses. Accessory buildings and land uses, as
identified in the Land Use Matrix Chart set forth in Section
1129.07 , shall be permitted as subordinate buildings or subordinate land uses
if they are clearly incident to, and located on the same parcel as the main
buildings or uses, and if they are located in zoning districts in which they
are specifically permitted. The use, change, extension, alteration, conversion,
enlargement, reconstruction, relocation or maintenance of accessory buildings
and land shall be subject to all area, yard, height, off-street parking and all
other regulations set forth or referred to for the zoning district in which
such accessory buildings or parcels of land are located, and to all other
applicable regulations of this Zoning Code. The procedures and standards for
evaluating and approving accessory uses are set forth in
Chapter 1141 .

1131.08 SUPPLEMENTAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY
ZONING DISTRICTS.
   In R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning districts, buildings and land shall be used,
and buildings shall be erected, altered, moved and maintained, only in
accordance with the lot area, yard and building height regulations set forth in
this chapter.
   (a)   Each single and two-family dwelling and townhouse cluster dwelling
unit shall abut upon a dedicated street for the required minimum lot width,
except on curved streets. On curved streets, the width at the front line may be
less than the minimum lot width, provided that the lot width at the front
building line meets the required lot width of the particular district and
provided, further, that:
      (1)   The distance from the building line to any point on the rear lot
line is not less than ninety feet; and
      (2)   The arc distance of the front lot line of a cul-de-sac lot is not
less than sixty feet.
      (3)   Corner lots in a R1-A zoning district shall have a minimum lot
width of ninety feet and one-hundred-twenty-five feet; respectively.
   (b)   Required Yards to be Maintained. In R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning
districts, no required yard surrounding an existing building shall be separated
in ownership from the portion of the lot upon which the building is located,
and no part shall be considered as providing a required yard for any other
existing building on the same or on an adjacent lot.
      (1)   No yard shall be reduced to less than the required dimensions for
the district in which it is located by enlarging an existing building, nor
shall a yard which is less than the required dimensions be further reduced in
any manner.
      (2)   Every required yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground
upward, except for accessory buildings as set forth in
Chapter 1141 and projections into yards as set forth in Section
1131.08(f).
   (c)   Front Yards of Partially Built Residential Street Blocks.
      (1)   In R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning districts, if fifty percent (50%) or
more of the aggregate street frontage between two successive intersecting
streets is occupied by buildings of the type and use permitted in the district
before the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, with a
front yard setback of less than that required by this Zoning Code, the minimum
front yard setback for new buildings shall be the average setback distance of
existing buildings located within 200 feet on either side of the lot seeking
the determination.
      (2)   However, the depth of the front yard setback shall be not less than
one-half of the minimum distance required in the respective zoning district.
   (d)   Side Yards of Insufficient Width. In R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning
districts, if side yards are narrower than the required minimum side yard
setback for the district in which the building and lot are located and such lot
was owned separately from all other tracts of land on the effective date of
this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, and is still so owned, the building
may be maintained or altered, but may not be enlarged in width unless the
minimum side yard setback distance established for the respective zoning
district can be maintained.
   (e)   Front Yard Setback on Corner Lots. The depth of the front yard setback
on a corner lot in any residential zoning district, shall not be less than the
required minimum front yard setback distance as established for the respective
zoning district.
   (f)   Projections Into Yards. As used in this chapter, “projection” means
that part or feature of a building which extends or projects outside of the
enclosing walls. It is intended that certain features may project into the
yards required in R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning districts, but such features shall
be regulated so as not to substantially interfere with the reception of sun,
light, air and the use of adjacent lots. Building features may project into a
front, side, or rear yard of a dwelling measured from the established yard
line, as follows:
      (1)   Architectural features. An architectural feature, including a belt
course, balcony, cornice, gutter or chimney, may project into a front and side
yard for a distance of two feet, provided that no part is less than three feet
from any side lot line.
      (2)   Entrance features. An entrance feature, including an open platform,
landing, step, terrace or any other feature not extending above the first floor
level of a building, may extend six feet into a front yard and three feet into
a side yard.
      (3)   Enclosed shelters. An enclosed shelter, including an enclosed entry
or porch, shall not project into any required yard area.
      (4)   Unenclosed shelters. An unenclosed shelter, including an entrance
hood or open, but roofed porch, may project six feet (6') into a front yard and
three feet into a side yard.
      (5)   Decks. An unenclosed and uncovered platform such as a deck or open
porch shall be located as follows:
         A.   R1-A and R2-F zoning districts. A minimum setback of twenty-five
feet from the rear lot line shall be maintained.
         B.   R1-C zoning district. A minimum setback of eighteen feet from the
rear lot line shall be maintained.
         C.   R2-F cluster zoning district. A minimum setback of eighteen feet
from the rear lot line shall be maintained.
      (6)   Mechanical equipment. Mechanical equipment serving a residential
dwelling may be located in either the rear yard or side yard area unless stated
otherwise in this Code. Such equipment may encroach into the minimum side yard
setback so long as the equipment maintains a minimum setback of eight feet from
the side property line.
         A.   Generators. A generator may only be permitted in a rear yard
area.
         B.   Air conditioner equipment. Air conditioner equipment may be
permitted in a side yard subject to review and approval by the Building
Commissioner. Any approved side yard placement shall require an approved method
for screening the equipment.
   (g)   Required Residential Lot Area to be Maintained. A parcel of land may
be subdivided into two or more parcels in R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning districts,
provided that all lots resulting from such subdivision conform to all the lot
area and width regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (1)   No lot of record which conformed to the provisions of this Zoning
Code and which was owned separately from adjoining lots on the effective date
of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, which affected its conformity,
shall be reduced in any manner which would make it nonconforming.
      (2)   No lot area, or any part thereof, required for a dwelling or any
other use shall be considered as providing any part of the required lot area
for another dwelling or use.
   (h)   Number of Structures Permitted on a Single Lot.
      (1)   In the R1-A, R1-C and R2-F zoning districts, there shall be not
more than one single-family dwelling or one two-family dwelling permitted on a
lot.
      (2)   There may be one detached garage, one enclosed accessory building,
and one unenclosed accessory building, such as a gazebo, on the same zoning lot
with a main building, provided that such accessory buildings and detached
garage are constructed subsequent to the main building.
      (3)   No single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling shall be located
to the rear of any building on the same lot or on another lot which does not
have the required frontage on a dedicated street. However, townhouse cluster
dwellings and apartment buildings may be arranged in groups and each building
need not directly front on a dedicated street.
   (i)   Minimum Livable Square Footage for a Dwelling.
      (1)   The calculation of minimum livable floor area for permitted
dwellings within the R1-A, R1-C or R2-F zoning districts shall be exclusive of
any garages, cornices, eaves, gutters, porches, balconies, terraces, outside
enclosures or basements.
      (2)   Basement areas meeting the ingress and egress requirements of the
Building Code shall not be included in the calculation of livable square
footage of a dwelling under this chapter.
   (j)   Ownership and Maintenance for Common Area Elements and Private
Infrastructure. The applicant shall provide documents detailing the proposed
ownership and maintenance structure of all common area and private
infrastructure within a development. These documents shall be provided as part
of the final subdivision development plan submission to the Planning Commission
and must be approved by City Council.
   (k)   Duplication of Dwelling Materials, Color and Style. Substantial
duplication of existing or planned exterior characteristics within a new
development shall be prohibited. Those existing or planned exterior
characteristics shall include, but not be limited to exterior materials,
material colors and styles of a home for another adjacent lot shall not be
permitted.

the use of or conditions on the property or surrounding properties, or other
circumstance outside the control of the owner/lessee, including easements and
rights-of-way;
      (2)   The design waiver, if approved, will not negatively impact the
context of the immediately surrounding neighborhood or broader area as a whole;
      (3)   The design waiver, if approved, will generally meet the spirit and
intent of this Zoning Code, the Middleburg Heights Master Plan and other
adopted City plans and policies.
      (4)   The design waiver is not being requested solely to reduce
applicant’s cost or as a matter of general convenience;
      (5)   The design waiver, if approved, will ensure that the design waiver
request is of equal or greater quality with respect to overall design,
material, and other similar development and construction features than without
the waiver;
      (6)   The requested design waiver is better addressed through this waiver
process rather than a zoning text amendment to the requirements of this
chapter; and
      (7)   The design waiver does not have the effect of authorizing any use
that is not otherwise permitted in the applicable zoning district.
   (d)   Board Decision.
      (1)   The Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
design waiver request. A written record of the Board decision will be provided.

      (6)   The screening of mechanical equipment will be reviewed on a case-
by-case basis based upon the following determinations:
         A.   Site location relative to adjacent properties and public rights-
of-way.
         B.   Topography of the subject site relative to adjacent properties
and public rights-of-way.
         C.   Whether the subject screening creates visual inconsistencies with
surrounding areas.
         D.   Whether the screening substantially meets the overall intent of
these SF architectural guidelines.

1137.01 ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE.
   The three zoning districts established in this chapter are intended to
provide a range of commercial, office and planned mixed use districts to
provide basic goods, services, employment opportunities and integrated
multifamily residential land uses. These regulations are also intended to
protect adjacent residential neighborhoods by regulating the types and spacing
of land uses, particularly at the common boundaries, which could create safety
hazards, noise, odors, inefficient traffic patterns, or other objectionable
influences or outcomes.
   (a)   General Goals and Purpose. The following goals apply to all three
zoning districts under this chapter:
      (1)   To ensure compatible relationships between land use activities.
      (2)   To insure the compatible orientation of one building to another in
regard to building bulk, architecture and open space.
      (3)   To provide for visually pleasing and functional treatment of open
areas.
      (4)   To provide for an efficient and safe circulation system for
pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles.
      (5)   To provide adequate and flexible parking space for immediate and
future needs.
      (6)   To ensure that signs are adequate, but properly controlled to
prevent them from detracting from the appearance of the development.
   (b)   Zoning District Specific Goals and Purpose.
      (1)   General Business (GB). The general business district provides areas
for a variety of business establishments engaged in retail sales, services,
office, medical, recreation and other related permitted land uses serving both
a local and regional market.
      (2)   Office (O). The office district provides areas suitable for office
developments, medical facilities, and other related land uses.
      (3)   Planned Mixed Use (PMU). The planned mixed use district provides a
flexible development framework that encourages the mixture of permitted land
uses in a comprehensively planned manner, including integrated multifamily
residential dwellings. The resulting development should provide design, layout
and amenities to a higher degree than the other business, commercial and
multifamily zoning districts. The following are specific goals for this zoning
district:
         A.   The planned mixed use district provides flexibility of design in
the placement and use of buildings and open spaces, circulation facilities and
off-street parking areas, and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site
characterized by special features of geography, topography, size or shape.
         B.   The planned mixed use district is intended to provide flexibility
in the application of certain design and development standards and requirements
of this Zoning Code in order to achieve the overall goals and purpose of the
district.
         C.   Because of the special characteristics of the planned mixed use
district, special provisions governing the development of land for this purpose
are required. Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions
of this chapter and other chapters of this Zoning Code, the requirements of
this chapter shall control.
         D.   Planned Mixed Use District Waivers. Consideration to provide
waivers for qualifying planned mixed use projects is provided for in this
chapter and may be considered by City Council to provide greater flexibility in
the design of developments in order to carry out the goals and intent of this
planned zoning district.
         E.   The applicant may request a concurrent preliminary plat and final
plat subdivision review and consideration during the PMU review process as set
forth in Section
1137.08 of this Zoning Code.

conditions and activities of the site and maintains the design standards set
forth in this chapter.
   (b)   Site Layout. Industrial buildings and other uses permitted in this
district should be designed and sited to create an attractive impression from
public corridors, and provide generously planted landscape setbacks to soften
the visual impact of buildings and frame the streets.
      (1)   Orient building fronts and entries towards streets, parking lots
and public spaces. Front office areas should be in the most visible locations,
as they add human scale to an industrial building.

1145.01   Nonconforming use purpose.
1145.02   Nonconforming use of buildings and land.
1145.03   Nonconforming buildings or structures.
1145.04   Nonconforming lots.
1145.05   Nonconforming parking facilities.
1145.06   Nonconforming signs.
1145.07   Maintenance and repair of structures.

   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this Zoning
Code’s enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one
or more of the regulations contained in this Code.
   (b)   Nonconforming use status is considered to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the zoning district in which it exists. Therefore,
nonconforming uses, buildings, lots, and structures are subject to regulations
limiting their use, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution.
Such nonconforming status shall be continued only in conformance with this
chapter.
   (c)   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1145.02 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS AND LAND.
   A nonconforming use may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful and
does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration or Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a Nonconforming
Use.
      (1)   No building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall be
altered, improved or reconstructed except when the cumulative cost of the
alteration, improvement or reconstruction does not exceed sixty percent (60%)
of the building’s replacement value.
      (2)   As an exception to Section
1145.02(a)(1), if a dwelling containing a legal nonconforming single family or
two-family land use located in an R1-A, R1-C, R2-F, GB or O zoning district is
damaged or destroyed by any cause, those portions so destroyed or damaged may
be restored to the original footprint and floor area of the dwelling subject to
the conditions set forth in Section
1145.03(c).
   (b)   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming
use of land shall not be physically enlarged, increased, extended, or relocated
to a part of the lot that was not occupied by the use at the time it became
nonconforming. No additional structures shall be constructed in connection with
such nonconforming use.
   (c)   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Structures. A
nonconforming use of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts
of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment to this Zoning Code. However, no such use shall
be extended to occupy any land outside such building not previously occupied by
such nonconforming use, and no such building shall be enlarged or expanded to
increase the nonconforming use.
   (d)   Change or Substitution of Use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be
changed or substituted to another nonconforming use unless the Planning
Commission, upon filing of a written request, finds that the use proposed is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Planning Commission may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this Zoning Code Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a
less intensive use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more
intensive nonconforming use.
      (2)   Sale or transfer of nonconforming use, building, structure or lot.
The sale or transfer of a legal nonconforming use, building, structure, or lot
shall not affect the determination of the change of use status.
   (e)   Abandonment or Discontinuance of Use.
      (1)   The abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming use of a
building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot for a continuous period of
180 days, or longer shall constitute voluntary abandonment or discontinuance of
such use and thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the applicable
use regulations of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Failure to bring the building, lot or part thereof into compliance
with the current Code regulations shall constitute a violation of this Zoning
Code.
   (f)   No new building or structure not conforming to the applicable
requirements of this Zoning Code shall be created in connection with a
nonconforming use of land.
(Ord. 2022-24.  Passed 5-24-22; Ord. 2023-6. Passed 6-27-23.)

legal nonconforming single-family or two-family dwelling located in an R1-A,
R1-C or R2-F zoning district is damaged or destroyed by any cause, those
portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and
floor area of the dwelling subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The dwelling shall be rebuilt as the same category of dwelling type
(i.e. a single-family dwelling may not be rebuilt as a multifamily dwelling).
      (2)   The dwelling shall not exceed the original dwelling’s total livable
and non-livable square footage area nor exceed the original structure height.
      (3)   Any restoration or reconstruction that exceeds the original
footprint and/or floor area of the original dwelling shall be constructed in a
manner that conforms to the current regulations of the zoning district in which
the structure is located.

setbacks.
      (5)   When a dwelling qualifies for reconstruction or restoration under
this section, a building permit shall be obtained for that purpose and such
reconstruction or restoration shall be diligently completed without delay.

date of damage or destruction revokes the right to the legal nonconforming use
status and the premises shall conform thereafter to all applicable Zoning Code
regulations.

nonconforming building or structure located in any zoning district not covered
under Section 1145.03(c) is damaged or destroyed by any cause, those portions
so destroyed or damaged may be restored or reconstructed to the original
footprint and floor area of the building or structure provided the cumulative
replacement costs do not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the replacement cost of
the building or structure at the time of such damage or destruction. Any
restoration or reconstruction that exceeds the original building or structure
footprint and/or floor area shall be constructed in a manner that conforms to
the applicable regulations of this Zoning Code. All restoration and
reconstruction shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A building permit authorizing such restoration or reconstruction
shall be obtained.
      (2)   Such restoration or reconstruction shall not cause a new
nonconformity, nor shall it increase the degree of nonconformity or
noncompliance existing prior to such damage or destruction.
      (3)   Failure to fully reconstruct or restore within one year from the
date of damage or destruction revokes the right to the legal nonconforming use
status and the premises shall conform thereafter to all applicable Zoning Code
regulations.

1149.11 PARKING SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following parking space requirements
provided in the Parking Space Use Table below shall apply. In the event a land
use is not listed in the Table, the following procedure for determining the
appropriate land use designation shall occur:
   (a)   The Building Commissioner shall refer to the land uses listed in
Parking Space Use Table to assist in determining a suitable land use category
that is substantially similar to the use under consideration based upon size of
use or structure, intensity of use and general type of land use.
   (b)   If the Building Commissioner determines that the land use under
consideration is not substantially similar to any of the land uses provided for
in this Table, the Building Commissioner shall then establish a minimum parking
space requirement for the unidentified land use. This minimum parking space
requirement shall be documented with supporting data or other Zoning Code
samples setting forth a reasonable minimum parking space requirement based upon
the land use under consideration and further based on those industry accepted
parking plan elements including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Estimated number of vehicle trips per day; and
      (2)   Estimated number of occupants for both all structures or open areas
located upon the parcel under consideration based upon maximum building

requirements for the site resulting from any altered or new land use(s), may
require the conversion of all or part of the land banked area to off-street
parking spaces in a manner consistent with the approved development plan.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1149.19 INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES.
   In the interpretation of this chapter, the following rules shall be in
effect:
   (a)   In calculating parking requirements, fractional numbers shall be
increased to the next whole number. For example, 13.01 shall mean fourteen.
   (b)   “Floor area” means the outside dimensions of the building, including
all projections such as stairways and porches, multiplied by the number of
floors. The resulting number is the square footage of the building used for
determining the number of off-street parking spaces required.

1153.11 SIGN MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Sign Measurement Standards. The area of the sign is determined
by the dimensions of the background structure, unifying background area, or by
the maximum dimensions of the display area if posted on a common background.
The following standards shall be used to determine the area and height
measurements for all signs erected or posted within the City:
      (1)   The area of a sign shall be computed by means of the smallest
rectangle area that will encompass the exterior display limits of a sign, but
not including the supporting frame or bracing as described in the illustrations
accompanying this section.
      (2)   The area of a sign composed of characters or words attached
directly to a building wall or roof surface shall be the smallest rectangle
which encloses the entire group of characters or words.
      (3)   The area of a sign with more than one face shall be computed by the
dimension of the largest single sign face. Any “V” shaped sign shall have its
area computed by adding each individual sign face to determine the total sign
area.
      (4)   In the case of irregularly shaped three dimensional signs, the area
of the display surface shall be measured on the plane of the largest vertical
cross section.
      (5)   The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical
distance between the highest point of the sign to the ground elevation at the
base of the sign. If mounding was used at the sign base, the ground elevation
shall be determined as the average ground elevation of the developed site at
the sign base prior to mounding.

amount permitted by other codes of the State, County or City.
      (4)   Odors. No use shall cause or allow the emission of odorous air
contaminants from any source sufficient to result in detectable odors as to
produce a public nuisance or hazard beyond any lot line on which the use
occurs.

   (d)   Enforcement Actions. In enforcing performance standards on existing
uses, the Building Commissioner may issue a written notice of violation to an
alleged violator.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner shall, before issuing such notice, make
technical determinations of any probable violation when such determinations can
be made using equipment and trained personnel normally available to the City or
obtainable without extraordinary expense.
      (2)   In certain cases, however, technical complexity or extraordinary
expense may make it fiscally unreasonable for the City to maintain personnel or

violation. In such cases, a notice of violation may be issued when the Building
Commissioner has other reason to believe there is probable violation.
      (3)   The Building Commissioner shall give notice of violation by any

correct the alleged violation within this time limit shall constitute admission
of a performance standards violation.
         C.   The notice shall further state that, if technical determinations
have not already been made, upon request of the alleged violator such
determinations will be made.
         D.   If a violation is found as a result of such determinations, the
cost incurred to seek a technical determination will be assessed against the
properties or parties responsible in addition to any other penalties provided
for. If no violation is found, the City shall be responsible for the costs
incurred in seeking a technical determination under this section.

1157.11 DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Jurisdiction Over Building Permits Requesting Demolition of a Building
or Structure. A building permit for the demolition of a building may be issued
by the Building Commissioner upon application by the owner of the property and
approval by the Planning Commission.

      (2)   If the Building Commissioner determines that such demolition is
proposed to be conducted in such manner as to avoid detrimental or blighting
influences upon the neighborhood and to avoid interfering with or impairing the
use and enjoyment of the neighboring premises.
   (d)   Demolition of Multi-Family and Non-Residential Structures. This
division applies to all structures except for single-family, two-family and
accessory structures.
      (1)   If the applicant’s proposed use is a permitted principal use or
accessory use to a permitted principal use within the zoning district, the
Planning Commission may simultaneously consider the development plans of the
applicant to determine preliminary or final approval in accordance with the
development plan provision of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   If the applicant’s proposed use of the zoning lot is a conditional
use or an accessory use to a conditional use within the zoning district,
Planning Commission shall simultaneously determine whether such use complies
with the purpose and intent and basic planning objectives of this Zoning Code,
complies with the planning objectives for the zoning district and the standards
expressed in the Conditional Use Chapter, and complies with(or is deemed to
comply by reason of satisfying the planning objectives of) all substantive
requirements of this Zoning Code applicable to such use.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission determines that the proposed demolition
is to be conducted in such manner as to avoid detrimental or blighting
influences upon the neighborhood and to avoid interfering with or impairing the
use and enjoyment of the neighboring premises, it shall approve the application
for a building permit for the demolition, notwithstanding its findings
regarding the proposed use or development plan.
      (4)   Prior to action being taken by the Planning Commission on an
application for a building permit for the demolition of a building, the
Planning Commission shall cause written notice of the initial meeting at which
such application shall be considered by the Commission to be mailed, by first
class mail, at least ten days before the date of such meeting, to the owners of
property within 200 feet from the borders of such parcel or parcels on which
the application for demolition of a building has been made to the addresses of
such owners appearing on the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s current tax list or the
Treasurer’s mailing list and to such other list or lists that may be specified
by the Commission. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate
any action by the Commission.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1157.12 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. In enacting this chapter, the Middleburg Heights
City Council makes the following statement of intent and findings:
         (1)   Sexually oriented business establishments require special
supervision from the public safety agencies of the City in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees
of the businesses as well as the citizens of the City.
         (2)   This Council finds that sexually oriented business
establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of this City that demands reasonable regulation of sexually
oriented business establishments by this City in the specified manner, and
expanded authority for reasonable regulation of sexually oriented business
establishments by local governments, in order to protect the health and well-
being of the citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by this City are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually
oriented business establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to
ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as
places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
business establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious
effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding
residential areas adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the
overnight hours, and downgrade property values.
      (6)   This Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects
by regulating sexually oriented business establishments in the specified
manner. By minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, this Council seeks
to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the
citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of urban blight.
      (7)   This Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of this City and that expanded regulation of sexually
oriented business establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of this Council in enacting this act to
suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of sexually oriented business establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of this Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and this Council recognizes that state and
federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and
encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes
against any such illegal activities in this state.
       (10)   It is the intent of this Council in enacting this chapter to
regulate in the specified manner sexually oriented business establishments in
order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the
citizens of this City and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the
deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented business establishments
within this City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it
is not the intent of this Council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny,
or authorize the restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize
the denial of, access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment
and adult materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this Council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution or exhibition of obscene material.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General
Assembly as findings under Section 3 of House Bill 23, this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented business establishments lend themselves to
ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by
the operators of the establishments.
      (2)   Certain employees of sexually oriented business establishments, as
defined in this section as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher
incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented business establishments, especially those that provide
private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
sex shows. The “couch dances” or “lap dances” that frequently occur in sexually
oriented business establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers
constitute or may constitute the offense of “engaging in prostitution” under
R.C. § 2907.25.
      (4)   Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented business establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those sexually oriented business
establishments.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection(HIV- AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented business
establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there
are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to
self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
      (8)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including,
but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential
spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (9)   Illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity, including lewd
conduct, masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually
oriented businesses, including those businesses which provide private or semi-
private rooms, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live
performances.
      (10)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which this City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial governmental interest in preventing secondary
effects, which is this City’s rationale for this chapter, exists independent of
any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, this City’s interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may located in this City. The City
finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this Zoning Code are
reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
      (11)   Sexually oriented business establishments have operational
characteristics that require or subject them to reasonable government
regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (12)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City.
   (c)   Location Standards.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated
a sexually oriented business in Middleburg Heights unless the sexually oriented
business is located at least 1,320 feet from another sexually oriented
business.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated
a sexually oriented business in Middleburg Heights, unless the sexually
oriented business is located at least 1,000 feet from the following “sensitive
uses”:
         A.   One thousand feet from the closest boundary of any residential
zoning district or parcel containing a residential land use.
         B.   One thousand feet from any child day-care center, hospital,
hotel, public or private parks and outdoor recreation, religious institution,
public use facility, residential care facility, public or private educational
institution or senior independent living community uses in or adjacent to the
City, whether or not such use is conforming or nonconforming, in or adjacent to
the City.
         C.   One thousand feet from all parcels containing a business that is
licensed to serve alcohol and is not primarily engaged in the sale and service
of food at the premises.
      (3)   Measurement standards.
         A.   The measure of distance shall be from the outermost wall of the
structure or proposed structure of the sexually oriented business that is
nearest to the applicable sensitive use or other sexually oriented business
establishment as set forth in this Section, to the property line of the
applicable sensitive use or other sexually oriented business establishment,
along the shortest possible straight line course, without regard to intervening
structures or topography considerations.
         B.   Where a sexually oriented business is located within a multi-
tenant structure, the measurement shall be to or from the closest part of the
tenant space occupied by the sexually oriented business.
(Ord. 2022-24. Passed 5-24-22.)
1157.13 MINOR YARD AMENITY STANDARDS.

      (1)   The Building Commissioner shall make the determination whether a
structure or piece of equipment qualifies as a “minor yard amenity.”

approved by the Building Commissioner and may be subject to screening or
special setback requirements determined on a case-by-case basis.
      (3)   A basketball pole and hoop system shall be permitted in the front
yard area without approval from the Building Commissioner.
   (c)   The use of any minor structure or equipment shall be terminated and
any such structure or equipment shall be removed or any deficiency therein
corrected, and any permit therefore shall be revoked, if the Building
Commissioner at any time determines that any use does not conform to the
requirements of this chapter or other substantive requirements of this Zoning
Code.

   (a)   The Telecommunications Act of l996 affirmed the City of Middleburg
Heights authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities. The Council of the City of Middleburg
Heights finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose a unique
hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of the City of
Middleburg Heights and its inhabitants. The Council of the City of Middleburg
Heights also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service
technology can be an economic development asset to the City and of significant
benefit to the City and its residents.
   (b)   The City recognizes a specific sub-category of telecommunication
provider called microcell wireless internet service provider, hereinafter
referred to as MWISP, providing hi-speed broadband internet connections using
radio waves sent from a ground-based distribution point directly to fixed
residential and business locations. All other wireless telecommunications
facilities are hereinafter referred to as WTF. In order to insure that the
placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications and
MWISP facilities are consistent with the City’s land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities
application and permit process.
   (c)   The intent of this chapter is to minimize the negative impact of
wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process
for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated comprehensive
review of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health,
safety and welfare of the City of Middleburg Heights.
