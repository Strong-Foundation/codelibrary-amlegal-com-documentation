CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
Editor’s note: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the state.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

earlier. Each requesting news medium shall be informed of such period of
effectiveness at the time it files its request. Such request may be modified or
extended only by filing a completely new request with the Fiscal Officer. A

municipal body that is the subject of such request and the Fiscal Officer.

notification, or both, as the Fiscal Officer determines, to the news media that

this section, of the time, place and purposes of each special meeting, at least
24 hours prior to the time of such special meeting.

Fiscal Officer.

§ 220.01 MEMBERSHIP; ELECTION; TERMS OF OFFICE.
   The legislative power of the municipality shall be vested in, and exercised
by, a Council, composed of six members, who shall be elected by the electors of
the municipality at large, for terms of four years.
(ORC 731.09)
§ 220.02 PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE.
   (a)   At the first meeting in January of each year, the Council shall
immediately proceed to elect a President Pro Tempore from its own number, who
shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his or her election.
The Council may provide employees for the municipality as it determines, and
employees may be removed at any regular meeting by a majority of the members
elected to the Council.
   (b)   When the Mayor is absent from the municipality, or is unable, for any
cause, to perform his or her duties, the President Pro Tempore shall be the
acting Mayor, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the
Mayor.
(ORC 731.10)
§ 220.03 VACANCY WHEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE BECOMES MAYOR.
   When the President Pro Tempore of the Council becomes the Mayor, the vacancy
thus created shall be filled as provided in §
220.06, and the Council shall elect another President Pro Tempore from its own
number, who shall have the same rights, powers, and duties as his or her
predecessor.
(ORC 731.11)
§ 220.04 QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS.
   (a)   Each member of the Council shall have resided in the municipality for
at least one year immediately preceding the member’s election, and shall be an
elector of the municipality. No member of the Council shall hold any other
public office, be interested in any contract with the municipality, or hold
employment with the municipality, except that the member may be a notary
public, a member of the state militia, or a volunteer firefighter of the
village; provided that such member shall not receive any compensation for his
or her services as a volunteer firefighter of the village in addition to his or
her regular compensation as a member of the Council. Any member who ceases to
possess any of these qualifications, or who moves from the municipality, shall
forfeit his or her office.
   (b)   The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this
section is to recognize that the municipality has a substantial and compelling
interest in encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of
member of the Council by ensuring that a candidate for the office has every
opportunity to become knowledgeable with and concerned about the problems and
needs of the area the candidate seeks to represent. In enacting this
requirement, the municipality finds that the one-year period is reasonably
related to this purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person’s right to travel,
to vote, and to be a candidate for public office.
(ORC 731.12)
§ 220.05 COMPENSATION AND BONDS OF VILLAGE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
   The Council shall fix the compensation and bonds of all officers, clerks,
and employees of the municipality, except as otherwise provided by law. The
Council shall, in the case of elective officers, fix their compensation for the
ensuing term of office at a meeting held not later than five days prior to the
last day fixed by law for filing as a candidate for such office. All bonds
shall be made with sureties subject to the approval of the Mayor. The
compensation so fixed shall not be increased or diminished during the term for
which any officer is elected or appointed. This section does not prohibit the
payment of any increased costs of continuing to provide the identical benefits
provided to an officer at the commencement of his or her term of office.
(ORC 731.13)
§ 220.06 VACANCIES.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, when the
office of a member of the Council becomes vacant, the vacancy shall be filled
by election by the Council for the unexpired term. If the Council fails within
30 days to fill the vacancy, the Mayor shall fill it by appointment, except
that subject to division (b) of this section, when the vacancy occurs because
of the operation of Ohio R.C. 733.25, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the successor shall hold office only for the period the President
Pro Tempore of the Council holds the office of Mayor.
   (b)   When a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the Council of a
village with a population of less than 2,000 because of the operation of Ohio
R.C. 733.25, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, at the time the
President Pro Tempore becomes Mayor, the President Pro Tempore shall decide
whether he or she wishes to serve the remainder of his or her unexpired term as
a member of the Council when the Mayor’s successor is elected and qualified in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 733.25, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance. If the President Pro Tempore decides to serve the remainder of his
or her unexpired term as a member of the Council, the vacancy on the Council
shall not be filled and the President Pro Tempore shall resume serving his or
her unexpired term on the Council as soon as the Mayor’s successor is elected
and qualified. If the President Pro Tempore decides not to resume serving the
remainder of his or her unexpired term as a member of the Council as soon as
the Mayor’s successor is elected and qualified, then the vacancy in the office
of the member of the Council shall be filled in accordance with this section.
(ORC 731.43(A))
§ 220.07 JUDGE OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS; QUORUM AND SPECIAL
MEETINGS.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualification of its
members. A majority of all the members elected shall be a quorum, but a less
number may adjourn from day to day and compel attendance of absent members in a
manner and under penalties as are prescribed by ordinance. The Council shall
provide rules for the manner of calling special meetings.
(ORC 731.44)
§ 220.08 RULES; JOURNAL; EXPULSION OF MEMBERS.
   The Council shall determine its own rules, and keep a journal of its
proceedings. It may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct or
violation of its rules, and declare his or her seat vacant for absence without
valid excuse, where the absence has continued for two months. No expulsion
shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the members
elected, and until the delinquent member has been notified of the charge
against him or her, and has had an opportunity to be heard.
(ORC 731.45)
§ 220.09 MEETINGS.
   The Council shall not be required to hold more than one regular meeting in
each week. The meetings may be held at a time and place as is prescribed by
ordinance, and shall, at all times, be open to the public. The Mayor, or any
three members of the Council, may call special meetings upon at least 12 hours’
notice to each member, served personally or left at his or her usual place of
residence.
(ORC 731.46)

§ 220.11 FAILURE TO TAKE OATH OR GIVE BOND.
   The Council may declare vacant the office of any person elected or appointed
to the office who, within ten days after he or she has been notified of his or
her appointment or election, or obligation to give a new or additional bond,
fails to take the required official oath or to give any bond required of him or
her.
(ORC 731.49)
§ 220.12 NOTICE WHEN NEW BOND REQUIRED.
   (a)   When the Council declares by resolution that an officer shall give a
new bond, written notice shall be served by the Fiscal Officer upon the officer
designated, and a copy of the notice, with a statement of the time and place of
service, shall be recorded in the proceedings of the Council.
   (b)   If the officer fails to give such new bond, with sureties, to the
satisfaction of the Mayor, within ten days after such service, the Council
shall declare the office vacant, and the vacancy shall be filled in the manner
provided in Title VII of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)   When a new bond is accepted or the Council declares the office vacant,
the sureties of the original bond shall cease to be liable for the acts of such
officer done thereafter, but shall continue to be liable for his or her acts
then already done.
(ORC 731.50)
§ 220.13 CARE, SUPERVISION AND MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
   Council shall provide by resolution or ordinance for the care, supervision,
and management of all public parks, baths, libraries, market houses,

owned, maintained or established by the municipality. When Council determines
to plat any of the streets, it shall provide for the platting thereof.

have no effect upon those members of the Council of the Village of Commercial
Point during the term for which such member was elected or appointed and this
section will not be effective upon each individual Council member until such
time as he or she is re-elected. This section, however, shall be effective
immediately upon passage and approval for those members of the Council of the
Village of Commercial Point elected or appointed after such date of approval.
   (f)   Members of Council may waive all or a portion of the salary set forth
in divisions (c) and (d) above.

by it. Such revision and codification may be made under appropriate titles,

cost. If Council amends or deletes any provision of such code, the publication

thereafter amends such code, Council may adopt such amendment or change by
incorporation by reference in an amending ordinance by the same procedure as
required for the adoption of the original code, without the necessity of
setting forth in full in the amending ordinance the provisions of the original
ordinance or code.
   (d)   Ordinances or codes adopted by the municipality under this section
shall be deemed to be a full and complete compliance with §§

the electors voting upon the measure in the municipality shall be subject to
the veto of the Mayor.

Governor at the most recent general election for the office of Governor in the
municipality, is filed with the Fiscal Officer within 30 days after any
ordinance or other measure is filed with the Mayor or passed by Council, or, if
the Mayor has vetoed the ordinance or any measure and returned it to Council,
such petition may be filed within 30 days after Council has passed the
ordinance or measure over his or her veto, ordering that such ordinance or
measure be submitted to the electors of the municipality for their approval or
rejection, such Fiscal Officer shall, after ten days, and not later than 4:00
p.m. of the seventy-fifth day before the day of election, transmit a certified

account of the insufficiency of the petitions by which such submission of the

§ 226.04 BIDS AND PROCEEDINGS.
   Each bid on any contract under §
222.02 or §
222.04 shall contain the full name of every person interested in such bid. If
the bid is for the construction, demolition, alteration, repair, or
reconstruction of an improvement, it shall meet the requirements of Ohio R.C.
153.54. If the bid is for any other contract authorized by §
222.02 or §
222.04, it shall be accompanied by a sufficient bond or certified check,
cashiers check, or money order on a solvent bank or savings and loan
association that, if the bid is accepted, a contract will be entered into and
the performance of it properly secured. If the bid for work embraces both labor
and materials, it shall be separately stated, with the price thereof. The
Council or Administrator, in the event an Administrator has been appointed as
provided by Ohio R.C. 735.271, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, may reject any and all bids. The contract shall be between the
municipality and the bidder, and the municipality shall pay such contract price
in cash. When a bonus is offered for completion of a contract prior to a
specified date, the Council or Administrator, in the event an Administrator has
been appointed as provided in Ohio R.C. 735.271, or a substantially equivalent

§ 226.05 AWARD TO LOWEST RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE BIDDER.
   (a)   (1)   If the municipality is required by law or by an ordinance or
resolution adopted under division (c) of this section to award a contract to
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, a bidder on the contract shall be
considered responsive if the bidder’s proposal responds to bid specifications
in all material respects and contains no irregularities or deviations from the
specifications which would affect the amount of the bid or otherwise give the
bidder a competitive advantage. The factors that the municipality shall
consider in determining whether a bidder on the contract is responsible include
the experience of the bidder, the bidder’s financial condition, conduct and
performance on previous contracts, facilities, management skills, and ability
to execute the contract properly.
      (2)   For purposes of this division, the provision of a bid guaranty in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 153.54(A)(1) and (B) issued by a surety licensed to
do business in this state is evidence of financial responsibility, but the
municipality may request additional financial information for review from an
apparent low bidder after it opens all submitted bids. The municipality shall
keep additional financial information it receives pursuant to a request under
this division confidential, except under proper order of a court. The
additional financial information is not a public record under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
      (3)   An apparent low bidder found not to be responsive and responsible
shall be notified by the municipality of that finding and the reasons for it.
The notification shall be given in writing and either by certified mail or, if
the municipality has record of an internet identifier of record associated with
the bidder, by ordinary mail and by that internet identifier of record.
   (b)   Where the municipality has adopted an ordinance or resolution under
division (c) of this section and determines to award a contract to a bidder
other than the apparent low bidder or bidders for the construction,
reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, repair, painting or
decoration of a
public improvement, it shall meet with the apparent low bidder or bidders upon
a filing of a timely written protest. The protest must be received within five
days of the notification required in division (a) of this section. No final
award shall be made until the municipality either affirms or reverses its
earlier determination. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Ohio Revised
Code, the procedure described in this division is not subject to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119.
   (c)   The municipality may, by ordinance or resolution, adopt a policy of
requiring each competitively bid contract it awards to be awarded to the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder in accordance with this section.
   (d)   As used in this section, “internet identifier of record” means an
electronic mail address, or any other designation used for self-identification
or routing in internet communication or posting, provided for the purpose of
receiving communication.

§ 226.06 ALTERATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS OF CONTRACTS.
   When it becomes necessary in the opinion of the Council or Administrator, in
the event an Administrator has been appointed as provided in Ohio R.C. 735.271,
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, in the prosecution of any
work under contract, to make alterations or modifications in such contract,
such alterations or modifications shall be made only by the Council by
resolution or by the Administrator in writing, in the event an Administrator
had been appointed as provided in Ohio R.C. 735.271, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, but such resolution or written modification
shall be of no effect until the price to be paid for the work and material, or
both, under the altered or modified contract has been agreed upon in writing
and signed by the contractor, and by the Mayor or Administrator in the event an
Administrator has been appointed as provided in Ohio R.C. 735.271, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, on behalf of the municipality. No
contractor shall recover anything for work or material because of any
alteration or modification unless such contract is made as provided in this
section, nor shall the contractor recover for such work or material, or either,
more than the agreed price. The law relating to requiring bids and the awarding
of contracts for public buildings, so far as they apply, shall remain in
effect. A duplicate copy of each contract shall be filed in the office of the
Fiscal Officer.

this chapter.
   (b)   Contents. A parking ticket issued for a violation of any provision
subject to the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau shall contain
provisions that:
      (1)   Advise the person to whom the ticket is issued that he or she must
answer in relation to the parking violation charged in the ticket;
      (2)   Advise the person to whom the ticket is issued that if he or she
fails to answer in a timely manner, additional penalties shall apply;
      (3)   Specify the allowable answers that may be made to the parking
violation charged, as provided in §
244.04;
      (4)   Advise the person that he or she will be afforded a hearing if he
or she denies in his or her answer that he or she committed the parking
violation;
      (5)   Specify the entity to which, the time within which, and the

following methods:

record on the parking ticket, in the space provided for identification of the
offender, the name of the operator and shall then personally serve the ticket

the owner and operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation.

who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the

accordance with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased

of the vehicle involved in the parking violation, if different, are jointly
liable for the parking violation and any fine or penalty arising out of the
parking violation. Any owner of a vehicle who pays any fine or penalty imposed
for a parking violation pursuant to this chapter may recover the amount paid
from the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
violation.

violation subject to the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau is
served shall be arrested as a result of the commission of the parking
violation.

section or any true copy of the same shall be considered a record kept in the
ordinary course of business of the Village of Commercial Point and the Police

the explanation does not meet any of the conditions outlined in division (d) of
this section and does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the
parking violation, the person shall be instructed to pay the full amount of the
fine arising out of the parking violation.
   (c)   Timely Payment. If the person has admitted he or she committed a
parking violation and the person's fine is reduced in accordance with division
(b)(1) of this section and the person has not previously paid the fine, or if
the person owes the full amount of the fine in accordance with division (b)(2)
of this section, the determination sent to the person shall instruct him or her

to a hearing held pursuant to §

may be reduced in accordance with the fees for failure to display required
placard, plates or parking card set forth in the village Parking Fee Schedule
found in §
244.99; or
      (5)   Any other extraordinary circumstance that mitigates the fact that

with a parking ticket charging the commission of a parking violation subject to
the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau, or who receives notice of
the violation pursuant to §
244.05, who answers by denying he or she committed the parking violation shall
be granted a hearing to determine if the person committed the parking
violation.
   (b)   Hearing. The Parking Violations Bureau shall set a date for the
hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the date, time, and place of the
hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking

hearing examiner considers appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of
evidence shall not be strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall
be under oath.
   (c)   Burden of Proof; Evidence.
      (1)   At the hearing, the village has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being
conducted committed the parking violation. The village shall submit the
original parking ticket that was personally or constructively served on the
person or a true copy of the ticket, and information from the Ohio Bureau of
Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the vehicle. The ticket and
information in proper form is prima facie evidence that the registered owner of
the vehicle was the person who committed the parking violation.
      (2)   The village may present additional evidence and testimony at the
hearing. The village does not have to be represented at the hearing by an
attorney.
      (3)   The person for whom the hearing is being conducted may present any
relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing. The person does not have to
attend the hearing if he or she submits documentary evidence to the hearing
examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
   (d)   Presence of Officer. If the person, in his or her answer, denied that
he or she committed the parking violation and requested the presence at the
hearing of the officer who issued the parking ticket, the officer shall be
required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner determines that the
officer's presence is not required. If the officer’s presence at the hearing
has been requested and the officer is unable to attend the hearing on the day

continuance.
   (e)   Decisions.
      (1)   If the person for whom the hearing is being conducted appears at
the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in accordance with division (c)(3) of
this section, the hearing examiner shall consider all evidence and testimony
presented and shall determine whether the village has established, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the parking violation.
If the hearing examiner determines that the person committed the parking
violation, an order indicating the determination as a judgment against the
person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional
penalties and/or hearing costs shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.
      (2)   If the person for whom the hearing is being conducted fails to
appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit evidence in accordance with
division (c)(3) of this section, the hearing examiner shall, if he or she
determines for any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the parking violation,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties and/or hearing costs. A default
judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)   If a person who is sent a notification of violation pursuant to §
244.05 of the Commercial Point Codified Ordinances does not timely answer, as
provided in §
244.05(c), the hearing examiner shall, if he or she determines from any
evidence and testimony presented by the village, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the person committed the parking violation, enter a default
judgment against the person and require the person to pay the appropriate fine
and any additional penalties and/or hearing costs. A default judgment entered
under this division shall be entered in the records of the Parking Violations
Bureau.
      (4)   If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in divisions (e)
(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section committed the parking violation, the
hearing examiner shall enter judgment against the village and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. No
additional penalties or hearing costs shall be entered against the person if
the hearing examiner finds the person did not commit the parking violation.
   (f)   Default Judgments. A default judgment entered under this section may
be vacated by the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following
apply:
      (1)   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one year of the date of entry
of the judgment;
      (2)   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking violation
out of which the judgment arose; and
      (3)   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's failure
to attend the hearing or answer the notification of the violation.
   (g)   Hearing Costs. When authorized under division (e) of this section, the
hearing examiner may include in the judgment entered against any person the
costs associated with the requested hearing, as set forth in the fee schedule
found in §

§ 244.08 JUDGMENTS.
   (a)   Payment of Judgments. Payment of any judgment or default judgment
entered against a person pursuant to this chapter shall be made to the Parking
Violations Bureau Clerk or his or her designee within ten days of entry. All
money paid in satisfaction of a judgment or default judgment shall be disbursed
by the Clerk to the Village's General Fund, and the Clerk shall enter the fact
of payment of the money and its disbursement in the records of the Bureau. If
payment is not made within the required ten days, the Parking Violations Bureau
may assess an additional penalty, as set forth in the fee schedule found in §
244.99. The judgment or default judgment may then be filed with the Clerk of
the Circleville Municipal Court, and when so filed, shall have the same force
and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered in the Court.
   (b)   Judgments Filed with the Circleville Municipal Court. Judgments and
default judgments filed with a court pursuant to this division shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 4521.08(C). When a judgment or default
judgment is filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other
measures may be taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection
of an unpaid money judgment in a civil action rendered in the Court. The
Circleville Municipal Court may assess costs against the judgment debtor, in an
amount not exceeding $10 for each parking violation, to be paid upon
satisfaction of the judgment.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is
entered pursuant to §
244.07, and the village if a judgment is entered against it pursuant to §
244.07, may appeal the judgment or default judgment to the Circleville
Municipal Court if the judgment or default judgment was entered by the Bureau,
or to the Pickaway County Juvenile Court if the judgment or default judgment
was entered by the Juvenile Court, by filing notices of appeal with the Parking
Violations Bureau or the Juvenile Court, and the Circleville Municipal Court or
the Clerk of the Juvenile Court within 15 days of the date of entry of the
judgment and by the payment of such reasonable costs as the Circleville
Municipal Court or the Pickaway County Juvenile Court requires. Upon the filing
of an appeal, the applicable court shall schedule a hearing date and notify the
parties of the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be held
by the applicable court in accordance with the rules of the court. Service of a
notice of appeal under this division by a person does not stay enforcement and
collection of the judgment or default judgment from which appeal is taken by
the person unless the person who files the appeal posts bond with the Parking
Violations Bureau, or the Pickaway County Juvenile Court in the full amount of
the judgment, plus court costs, at or before the service of the notice of
appeal. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of
the Circleville Municipal Court or the Pickaway County Juvenile Court is final,
and no other appeal of the judgment of the Parking Violations Bureau, or the
Juvenile Court, whichever is applicable, and no appeal of the judgment of the
Circleville Municipal Court or the Juvenile Court, may be taken.
   (d)   Time for Filing Judgment. A judgment or default judgment entered
pursuant to §
244.07 may be filed with the Circleville Municipal Court under division (b) of
this section at any time within three years after the date of issuance of the
parking ticket charging the parking violation out of which the judgment arose.

with the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in a parking
ticket for the parking violation or any fine, penalty, or processing fee
arising out of the parking violation under this chapter if either of the
following apply:
      (1)   The owner answers the charge of the parking violation under §§
244.04 or
244.05, the answer denies that the owner committed the violation and requests a
hearing concerning the violation, the owner additionally asserts and provides
reasonable evidence at that time to prove that the vehicle, at the time of the
commission of the parking violation, was being used by the operator without the
owner's express or implied consent, and the Parking Violations Bureau or the
Pickaway County Juvenile Court determines that the vehicle was being used
without the owner's express or implied consent at that time. If the Bureau or
the Juvenile Court does not so determine, it shall conduct the hearing
concerning the parking violation according to §
244.07.
      (2)   The owner answers the charge of the parking violation under §§
244.04 or
244.05, the answer denies that the owner committed the parking violation, the
owner additionally submits evidence at that time that proves that, at the time
of the alleged commission of the parking violation, the owner was engaged in
the business of renting or leasing vehicles under written rental or lease
agreements, and the owner additionally submits evidence that proves that, at
the time of the alleged commission of the parking violation, the vehicle in
question was in the care, custody, or control of a person other than the owner
pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement. If the owner does not so
prove, the Parking Violations Bureau or the Pickaway County Juvenile Court
shall conduct a hearing relating to the parking violation according to §
244.07.
      (3)   The owner, at a hearing concerning the parking violation conducted
in accordance with §
244.07, proves that the vehicle, at the time of the parking violation, was

proves the facts described in division (a)(2) of this section.
   (b)   Rentals.
      (1)   An owner of a vehicle who is engaged in the business of renting or
leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements, but who does not
satisfy the additional requirements of division (a)(2) of this section is not
liable for any penalties or processing fees arising out of a parking violation
involving the vehicle if at the time of the commission of the parking
violation, the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person other
than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement, and if the
owner answers the charge of the parking violation by denying that the owner
committed the parking violation or by paying the fine arising out of the
parking violation within 30 days after actual receipt of the parking ticket
charging the violation or, if the owner did not receive the parking ticket,
within 30 days after receipt of the notification of violation.
      (2)   Proof that the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a
person other than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement at
the time of the alleged parking violation shall be established by sending a
true copy of the rental or lease agreement or an affidavit to that effect to
the Parking Violations Bureau or the Pickaway County Juvenile Court, as
applicable, within 30 days after the date of receipt by the owner of the
parking ticket charging the violation or, if the owner did not receive the
parking ticket, within 30 days after receipt of the notification of violation.
The submission of a true copy of a written rental or lease agreement or
affidavit shall be prima facie evidence that a vehicle was in the care,
custody, or control of a person other than the owner. The affidavit authorized
by this section shall be accompanied by a postage-paid, self-addressed
envelope, shall be in a form the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall
prescribe, and shall include space for the Parking Violations Bureau or the
Juvenile Court to indicate receipt of the affidavit. Within 30 days of receipt
of the affidavit, the Bureau or Court, as applicable, shall return a receipted
copy of the affidavit to the rental or lease company. In addition, any
information required by division (a)(2) of this section may be provided on
magnetic tape, or another computer or electronic or digital readable media in a
format acceptable to the Parking Violations Bureau or Juvenile Court.

a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for

§ 414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent the installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate the street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or

§ 414.03 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.

are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane- use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

   (d)   Evidence; tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. § 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical

vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.

this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance

ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.

   (h)   Penalty for driving under the influence.
      (1)   Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through (a)
(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for
either offense under R.C. Chapter 2929, except as otherwise authorized or
required by divisions (h)(1)A. through (h)(1)E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the
penalties and sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(a)(i) to (G)(1)(a)
(iv).
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this

convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) of this
section, or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of division (a) of this
section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

this section or other equivalent offenses or an offender who, within 20 years
of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or
more violations of that nature, or an offender who previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a specification of the type described in R.C.
§ 2941.1413, is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state
law.
         E.   An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) that was a felony, regardless of
when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. §
4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under R.C. §
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (G)(1)(b)(ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (G)(1)(c)(ii) and if,
within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by R.C.
§ 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender’s driver’s or occupational driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to
grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(5).

assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in
addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02(f) or
R.C. § 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

or plasma, or urine.
         C.   The test or tests indicated that the offender had a prohibited
concentration of a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in the offender’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine at the
time of the offense.

the same meaning as in R.C. § 2929.01.
   (i)   Penalty for operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption.
Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited
driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any jail term
imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is guilty

offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02
(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.
   (j)   Treatment programs.

Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.
   (l)   Exception; direction of health professional. Division (a)(1)J. of this
section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the amount specified in that division, if both of
the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   Applicability to R.C. § 2923.16(D). The prohibited concentrations of a
controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in division (a)(1)J.
of this section.
      (3)   Field sobriety test.
         A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on
the offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(7).

has been suspended pursuant to R.C. § 2151.354, 2151.87, 2935.27, 3123.58,
4301.99, 4510.032, 4510.22, or 4510.33, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(3)B. of this
section, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be
sentenced pursuant to §

698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
698.02(d) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.
(R.C. § 4510.111)
   (c)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. § 4510.037 and

and highways is guilty of driving under a 12-point suspension, a misdemeanor of
the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to a minimum term of
three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days of jail time
imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)
§ 436.09 OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person
has a valid driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4507 or a commercial
driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
698.02(d) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 30 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         B.   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000;

the jail terms provided in R.C. § 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence
the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The ten-day
mandatory jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to division (c) of this
section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90 consecutive
days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of house arrest
with electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year;
         B.   Notwithstanding the fines provided for in R.C. Chapter 2929, a

      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under O.V.I. suspension is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         A.   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days. Notwithstanding the
jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence the

offense is registered in the offender’s name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender’s vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so imposed
shall be distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section
unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

   (e)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the Mayor of a Mayor’s

from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the court grants
limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this section, the
privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the offender must
display restricted license plates, issued under R.C. § 4503.231, on the vehicle
driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from holding
a commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver’s
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person whose

      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the
database under division (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and
included in the database under division (c)(5) of this section is not a public
record subject to inspection or copying under R.C. § 149.43.
   (d)   Officers not permitted to stop cars to determine violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually
inspect any automobile being operated on any street or highway for the sole
purpose of determining whether the violation has been or is being committed.
   (e)   Use of fines for educational program. All fines collected for
violations of division (b) of this section shall be forwarded to the State
Treasurer for deposit in the funds as set forth in R.C. § 4513.263(E).
   (f)   Limitations on evidence used for prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in § 408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
$20.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

         C.   A counterfeit air bag, air bag cover, or some other object that
is installed in a vehicle to deceive an owner or operator of the vehicle into
believing that a functional air bag has been installed.
   (b)   No person shall install or reinstall in any motor vehicle a
counterfeit or nonfunctional air bag or any object intended to fulfill the
function of an air bag other than an air bag that was designed in conformance
with or that is regulated by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 208
for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle, knowing that the object is
not in accordance with that standard.
   (c)   No person shall knowingly manufacture, import, sell, or offer for sale
any of the following:
      (1)   A counterfeit air bag;
      (2)   A nonfunctional air bag;

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.
(R.C. § 4549.20)
§ 438.33 NOISE EMITTED BY ENGINE COMPRESSION BRAKING.
   (a)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle, except when necessary for
safe operation, or in compliance with the law, in such a manner that the
vehicle is so rapidly accelerated or started from a stopped position, in the
shifting of gears while in motion, that the exhaust system emits a loud
cracking or chattering noise unusual to its normal operation commonly known as
engine compression braking.

§ 440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.99)

any street in the municipality other than state routes and county roads, except
those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by
appropriate traffic signs, and except when the operation is necessary to load
or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of the vehicle
or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage through
the municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a state route
or a designated truck route within the municipality shall confine the deviation
to that required in order to accomplish the purpose
of the departure. On county roads, Council or other duly designated local
authority shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the
construction and material specifications for the roads and the load resistance
of the roads as determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted
with signs indicating the weight limits.
   (d)   Local permit and conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for the vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge $25, and for
each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Department in
supervising the movement of the vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
$50.
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of the permit and denial of request for any future permit. This
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by §§
408.01 and 408.02.

concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
for a violation of division (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section or
less than the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a
listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of
division (a)(6) of this section, that fact may be considered with other
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant or in
making an adjudication for the child. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division
(b) of this section or for a violation of a prohibition that is substantially
equivalent to that division.
      (5)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney
immediately upon completion of the test analysis.
      (6)   If the chemical test was administered pursuant to division (d)(2)
of this section, the person tested may have a physician, registered nurse or
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the
direction of a law enforcement officer, and shall be so advised. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
   (e)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating or being in physical control of any vessel underway or to
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane or similar device on the waters of this
state while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination
of them, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating or being in physical
control of any vessel underway or to manipulating any water skis, aquaplane or
similar device on the waters of this state with a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement
officer has administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person found
to be in physical control of the vessel underway involved in the violation or
the person manipulating the water skis, aquaplane or similar device involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety tests
for vehicles that were in effect at the time the tests were administered,
including but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that have
been set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that by their
nature are not clearly inapplicable regarding the operation or physical control
of vessels underway or the manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes or similar
devices, all of the following apply:
         A.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
         B.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         C.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (e)(1)A. or (e)(1)B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence
is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony
or evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of
fact considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Division (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (e)(1) of this section.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to division (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a) or (b)
of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent
to either of those divisions, the court shall admit as prima facie evidence a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division. The laboratory report shall contain all of the
following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s or child’s
attorney or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the defendant or
child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant or child to whom the report
pertains or the defendant’s or child’s attorney receives a copy of the report,
the defendant or child or the defendant’s or child’s attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend
the seven-day time limit in the interests of justice.
   (g)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, R.C. § 1547.111 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and a hospital, first-aid station
or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section,
R.C. § 1547.111 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, is immune
from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or
any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in
withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided in this division also
extends to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency
medical technician-intermediate or an emergency medical technician-paramedic
who withdraws blood under this section. The immunity provided in this division
is not available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in
willful or wanton misconduct.
   (h)   Division (a)(6) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates or is in physical control of a vessel underway or manipulates any

   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree and shall be punished as provided in division (j)(1), (j)(2) or (j)(3)
of this section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section, the court shall sentence the offender to a jail term of three
consecutive days and may sentence the offender pursuant to R.C. § 2929.24 to a
longer jail term. In addition, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine
of not less than $150 nor more than $1,000. The court may suspend the execution
of the mandatory jail term of three consecutive days that it is required to
impose by this division (j)(1) if the court, in lieu of the suspended jail
term, places the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to R.C. §
2929.25 and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.38. The
court also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory jail term of
three consecutive days that it is required to impose by this division (j)(1) if
the court places the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.25 for part of the three consecutive days; requires the offender to
attend, for that part of the three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.38; and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the drivers’ intervention program.
The court may require the offender, as a condition of community control, to
attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs, in
addition to the required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
      (2)   If, within ten years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) of this
section, R.C. § 1547.11(A) or one other equivalent offense, the court shall
sentence the offender to a jail term of ten consecutive days and may sentence
the offender pursuant to R.C. § 2929.24 to a longer jail term. In addition, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not less than $150 nor more than
$1,000. In addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the offender,
the court may require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program
that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.38.
      (3)   If, within ten years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to more than one violation or offense identified
in division (j)(2) of this section, the court shall sentence the offender to a
jail term of 30 consecutive days and may sentence the offender to a longer jail
term of not more than one year. In addition, the court shall impose upon the
offender a fine of not less than $150 nor more than $1,000. In addition to any
other sentence that it imposes upon the offender, the court may require the
offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant
to R.C. § 5119.38.
      (4)   Upon a showing that serving a jail term would seriously affect the
ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1), (j)(2) or (j)(3)
of this section to continue the offender’s employment, the court may authorize
that the offender be granted work release after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of three, ten or 30 consecutive days that the court is
required by division (j)(1), (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section to impose. No
court shall authorize work release during the mandatory jail term of three, ten
or 30 consecutive days that the court is required by division (j)(1), (j)(2) or
(j)(3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not

(R.C. § 1547.99(G))
§ 448.11 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Any person who operates or is in physical control of a
vessel or manipulates any water skis, aquaplane or similar device upon any
waters in this municipality shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical
test or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine if arrested for operating
or being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane or similar device in violation of R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
         B.   The test or tests under division (a)(1)A. of this section shall
be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable
grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control of a vessel
or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane or similar device in violation of
R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance. The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which test
or tests shall be administered.
      (2)   Any person who is dead or unconscious or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(1) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 to 313.16.
   (b)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for operating or
being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane
or similar device in violation of R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and if the person previously has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to two or more violations of § 1547.11(A) or other equivalent
offenses, the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and
the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining
the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of refusing to submit to
the test or tests and is not required to give the person the form described in
division (c) of this section, but the officer shall advise the person at the
time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take a chemical test the
officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the
person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or
plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the time of the arrest that
the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense. The advice shall be in written form prescribed by the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft and shall be read to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. The reading of the form shall
be witnessed by one or more persons, and the witnesses shall certify to this
fact by signing the form. Divisions (a)(1)B. and (a)(2) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
      (2)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (b)(1) of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
   (c)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, any person under
arrest for violating R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance shall be advised of the consequences of refusing to submit to a
chemical test or tests designated as provided in division (a) of this section.
The advice shall be in a written form prescribed by the Chief of the Division
of Parks and Watercraft and shall be read to the person. The form shall contain
a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to the
person by the arresting officer. The reading of the form shall be witnessed by
one or more persons, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing
the form. The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to
the request of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the
alleged violation, and if the person does not submit to the test or tests
within that two-hour time limit, the failure to submit automatically
constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, if a law
enforcement officer asks a person under arrest for violating R.C. § 1547.11 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to submit to a chemical test or
tests as provided in division (a) of this section, if the arresting officer
advises the person of the consequences of the person’s refusal as provided in
division (c) of this section, and the person refuses to submit, no chemical
test shall be given. Upon receipt of a sworn statement of the officer that the
arresting law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the
arrested person violated R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance and that the person refused to submit to the chemical test upon the
request of the officer, and upon receipt of the form as provided in division
(d) of this section certifying that the arrested person was advised of the
consequences of the refusal, the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall inform the person by written notice that the person is prohibited from
operating or being in physical control of a vessel, from manipulating any water
skis, aquaplane or similar device, and from registering any watercraft in
accordance with R.C. § 1547.54, for one year following the date of the alleged
violation. The suspension of these operation, physical control, manipulation
and registration privileges shall continue for the entire one-year period,
subject to review as provided in this section.
      (2)   If the person under arrest is the owner of the vessel involved in
the alleged violation, the law enforcement officer who arrested the person
shall seize the watercraft registration certificate and tags from the vessel
involved in the violation and forward them to the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft. The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall
retain the impounded registration certificate and tags and shall impound all
other registration certificates and tags issued to the person in accordance
with R.C. §§ 1547.54 and 1547.57, for a period of one year following the date
of the alleged violation, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (3)   If the arrested person fails to surrender the registration
certificate because it is not on the person of the arrested person or in the
watercraft, the law enforcement officer who made the arrest shall order the
person to surrender it within 24 hours to the law enforcement officer or the
law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer. If the person
fails to do so, the law enforcement officer shall notify the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft of that fact in the statement the officer
submits to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft under this
division.
   (e)   Upon suspending a person’s operation, physical control, manipulation
and registration privileges in accordance with division (d) of this section,
the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall notify the person in
writing, at the person’s last known address, and inform the person that the
person may petition for a hearing in accordance with division (f) of this
section. If a person whose operation, physical control, manipulation and
registration privileges have been suspended petitions for a hearing or appeals
any adverse decision, the suspension shall begin at the termination of any
hearing or appeal unless the hearing or appeal results in a decision favorable
to the person.
   (f)   (1)   Any person who has been notified by the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating or being in
physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane or
similar device and from registering any watercraft in accordance with R.C. §
1547.54, or who has had the registration certificate and tags of the person’s
watercraft impounded pursuant to division (d) of this section, within 20 days
of the notification or impoundment, may file a petition in the municipal court
or the county court, or if the person is a minor in juvenile court, with
jurisdiction over the place at which the arrest occurred, agreeing to pay the
cost of the proceedings and alleging error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Parks and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or
alleging one or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided
in this section, or both. The petitioner shall notify the Chief of the Division
of Parks and Watercraft of the filing of the petition and send the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft a copy of the petition.
      (2)   The scope of the hearing is limited to the issues of whether the
law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner was
operating or in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane or similar device in violation of R.C. § 1547.11 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, whether the petitioner was placed under arrest,
whether the petitioner refused to submit to the chemical test upon request of
the officer, and whether the petitioner was advised of the consequences of the
petitioner’s refusal.
   (g)   (1)   The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall furnish
the court a copy of the affidavit as provided in division (c) of this section
and any other relevant information requested by the court.
      (2)   In hearing the matter and in determining whether the person has
shown error in the decision taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft as provided in division (d) of this section, the court shall decide
the issue upon the relevant, competent and material evidence submitted by the
Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft or the person whose operation,
physical control, manipulation and registration privileges have been suspended.
In the proceedings, the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall be
represented by the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the petition is
filed if the petition is filed in a county court or juvenile court, except that
if the arrest occurred within a city or village within the jurisdiction of the
county court in which the petition is filed, the city director of law or
village solicitor of that city or village shall represent the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft. If the petition is filed in the municipal
court, the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall be represented
as provided in R.C. § 1901.34.
      (3)   If the court finds from the evidence submitted that the person has
failed to show error in the action taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks
and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in one or more of the
matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in division (f) of this
section, or both, the court shall assess the cost of the proceeding against the
person and shall uphold the suspension of the operation, physical control, use
and registration privileges provided in division (d) of this section. If the
court finds that the person has shown error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Parks and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in
one or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in
division (f) of this section, or both, the cost of the proceedings shall be
paid out of the county treasury of the county in which the proceedings were
held, Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall reinstate the
operation, physical control, manipulation and registration privileges of the
person without charge, and the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall return the registration certificate and tags, if impounded, without
charge.
      (4)   The court shall give information in writing of any action taken
under this section to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft.

this section, and upon request of the person whose operation, physical control,
use and registration privileges were suspended or whose registration
certificate and tags were impounded, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall reinstate the person’s operation, physical control,
manipulation and registration privileges by written notice and return the
certificate and tags.

§ 452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

place.
      (3)   A.   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been
so left without permission or notification as prima facie evidence of

of other ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles
on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
municipality.

obstruct the safe flow of traffic and emergency vehicles as well as the proper
cleaning and clearing of snow to make safe all public streets within the

absence of the Chief of Police, any other village official designated by the
Mayor, is hereby authorized to announce to broadcast media within the area of
the village that a snow emergency is in effect and therefore parking on all
streets in the village is forbidden to facilitate the clearing of streets.
      (2)   The village shall make every effort to inform the public of the
existence of the weather conditions requiring the removal of parked vehicles
from the streets designated, but the owners, operators, or other persons
responsible for such vehicle parked in these areas shall have full
responsibility to determine existing weather conditions and to remove parked
vehicles if the weather conditions are such as to require the removal under the
terms of this section.
      (3)   The local broadcast media shall announce the emergency and the time
that the emergency parking regulations shall become effective, which time shall
be no sooner than three hours after the first announcement to the above named
broadcast media, or immediately upon the declaration of a Level 1, Level 2, or
Level 3 Snow Emergency by the Pickaway County Sheriff, and such announcement to
the broadcast media shall constitute notice to the general public of the
existence of the emergency period.

of the Police Department shall be authorized and empowered to provide for the
removal of any vehicles parked on any of the streets, highways, thoroughfares,
alleys or public roadways in the village in areas designated for removal during
snow emergencies to be taken to such garage or other place the Mayor or other
person under his or her direction or member of the Police Department deems
appropriate.
      (2)   Any costs incurred in such removal or storage shall be paid for by
the owner, operator or other person responsible for such vehicle, in addition
to any fines imposed for a violation of this section.

is hereby directed to post signs on the major thoroughfares leading into the
village notifying the public that parking is prohibited on streets of the

residents of prohibited parking during snow emergencies.
      (2)   Snow emergency signs shall be of sufficient size and legibility and
be placed upon the streets, highways, thoroughfares, alleys or other public
roadways, or fixed to utility poles within the village, in sufficient numbers
as will in the opinion of the Mayor be proper and adequate notice to the
citizens that no vehicles may be parked in such areas during any snow
emergency.
   (g)   Penalty. Any person or persons violating the provisions of this
section with respect to failure to remove parked vehicles as required by this
section, is hereby guilty of a minor misdemeanor with each day to be a separate
violation.

licensed towing service facility, in a licensed motor vehicle salvage facility,
in a licensed scrap processing yard, in a licensed auto repair garage yard, in
a licensed paint spray shop yard, in a licensed gasoline station yard, in a
licensed vehicle dealership yard, or in any other lawful storage area not
within the public view.
   (d)   (1)   In the event of a violation of this section, the village
solicitor, Mayor, Chief of Police or his or her designate, or municipal zoning
authority shall cause notice to be given to the titled owner of the motor
vehicle, or to the owner, lessee, agent or tenant having the right to
possession of such real property, if the titled owner of the motor vehicle is
unknown, to cease such violation within ten days of receipt of the notice.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, notice may be served in any manner
permitted under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. If the address of the titled
owner of the motor vehicle or the owner, lessee, agent or tenant having the
right to possession of such property is unknown, it shall be sufficient to
publish the notice of the finding once in a newspaper of general circulation in
this municipality.
   (e)   The notice required to be given as set forth in division (d) above
shall state the following information:
      (1)   The nature of the public nuisance;
      (2)   The description of and location of the motor vehicle;
      (3)   A statement that the motor vehicle must be removed from the
premises within ten days after service of such notice and order of the same or
be removed;
      (4)   A statement that removal of the vehicle must be to a location
permitted by division (c) hereof;
      (5)   A statement of the penalties provided for noncompliance; and
      (6)   A statement that the property owner shall be assessed the costs
incurred by the village in removing and storing the vehicle.
   (f)   Should the person upon whom notice is served or the owner of the motor
vehicle, within ten days after receipt of the notice set forth in this section,
notify the Police Chief or his or her designate that the motor vehicle in issue
is either an abandoned motor vehicle or an abandoned junk motor vehicle which
has been left on his or her property without permission of the person having
the right to possession of the property and requests the removal thereof, the
Police Chief or his or her designate shall cause the removal of such vehicle
pursuant to §§
404.07,
404.10, or
452.05(g) respectively.
   (g)   (1)   If the owner of the motor vehicle or the person upon whom notice
is given fails to comply with this section within ten days of receipt of the
notice then, it shall be conclusively presumed that the motor vehicle in
question is a public nuisance and, in addition to any other penalty as set
forth in this chapter, the Police Chief or his or her designate, or the Mayor,
may cause such motor vehicle to be removed for the preservation of the life,
health, comfort and safety of the public by the direct employment of labor or
by authorizing another person to remove the motor vehicle on behalf of the
village and assess the cost of removal against either the owner of the motor
vehicle or the person upon whom notice was served.
      (2)   The fact that a junk motor vehicle is left on private property for
more than ten days after receipt of the notice as set forth in this section is
prima-facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice.
   (h)   In the event that the titled owner of the motor vehicle, or if the
titled owner of the motor vehicle is unknown, then the owner, lessee, agent or
tenant having the right to the possession of the real property upon which the
motor vehicle is situated, violates this section more than two times within any
one year period, then the notice of violation and ten day compliance period
shall not apply and such person shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this
section and shall be subject to the penalty established under this chapter.
   (i)   Any person may store or keep by unrestricted method any collectors
vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission
of the person having the right to the possession of the property, except that
such vehicle shall be concealed, by means of buildings, fences, vegetation,
terrain or other suitable obstruction, and unlicensed collectors vehicle stored
in the open.
   (h)   That in addition to the ability of the village to remove and impound
junk and other vehicles located on private or public property with the
permission of the owner, any person in violation of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor for the first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree
for each subsequent offense.

offense, the term includes all of the following:
            1.   An individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust,
partnership and association.
            2.   An unborn human who is viable.
         (b)   As used in any section contained in Title XIII of this code that

corporation, business trust, estate, partnership and association.
         (c)   As used in division (1)A.2. of this definition, “unborn human”
means an individual organism of the species Homo sapiens from fertilization
until live birth. “Viable” means the stage of development of a human fetus at
which there is a realistic probability of maintaining and nourishing of a life
outside the womb with or without temporary artificial life-sustaining support.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (1)A. of this definition, in no case shall
the portion of the definition of the term “person” that is set forth in
division (1)A.2. of this definition be applied or construed in any section
contained in Title XIII of this code that sets forth a criminal offense in any
of the following manners:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (2)A. of this
definition, in a manner so that the offense prohibits or is construed as
prohibiting any pregnant woman or her physician from performing an abortion
with the consent of the pregnant woman, with the consent of the pregnant woman
implied by law in a medical emergency, or with the approval of one otherwise
authorized by law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant
woman. An abortion that violates the conditions described in the immediately
preceding sentence may be punished as a violation of R.C. § 2903.01, 2903.02,

2903.14, 2903.21 or 2903.22, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, as applicable. An abortion that does not violate the conditions
described in the second immediately preceding sentence but that does violate
R.C. § 2919.12, 2919.13(B), 2919.15, 2919.151, 2919.17 or 2919.18, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, may be punished as a violation of

of the type otherwise adequate to permit medical treatment to the pregnant
woman, even if it does not comply with R.C. § 2919.12.
         (b)   In a manner so that the offense is applied or is construed as
applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:
            1.   Her delivery of a stillborn baby;
            2.   Her causing, in any other manner, the death in utero of a
viable, unborn human that she is carrying;
            3.   Her causing the death of her child who is born alive but who

any other manner, an injury, illness, or other psychological illness or
condition, regardless of its duration or gravity, to a viable, unborn human
that she is carrying.

any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is

municipality for the attempt, complicity or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.

PUBLIC SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or

the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(R.C. § 2901.13)
§ 606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are “involuntary acts.”
      (4)   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 606.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 606.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 606.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C. §
2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by the organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in that
conduct, or tolerates that conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and the duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 606.11 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
§ 606.12 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
§ 606.13 SELF DEFENSE; LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 606.14 CURFEW.
   There is hereby established a curfew for children under the age of 18 years
within the village limits which shall read as follows.
   (a)   No minor under the age of 18 years shall loiter, idle, wander, stroll,
or play in or upon the public streets, highways, roads, alleys, parks, public
buildings places of amusement and entertainment, or vacant lots, between the
hours of 10.30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the following day, official village time.
The provisions of this section, however, do not apply to a minor accompanied by
his or her parent, guardian, or other person having the care and custody of the
minor, or when the minor is upon an emergency errand or legitimate business
directed by his or her parent, guardian, or other adult person having the care
and custody of the minor.
   (b)   No parent, guardian, or other adult person having the care and custody
of the minor under the age of 18 years shall knowingly permit such minor to
loiter idle, wander, stroll, or play in or upon the public streets, highways,
roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, or public grounds, public places, and public
buildings, places of amusement and entertainment, or vacant lots, between the
hours of 10:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the following day, office village time.
The provisions of this section, however, do not apply when the minor
accompanied by his or her parent, guardian, or other adult person having the
care and custody of the minor, or if the minor is upon an emergency errand or
legitimate business directed by his or her parent, guardian, or other person
having the care and custody of the minor.
   (c)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty
of minor misdemeanor.

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a

keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.16 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of

with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that § 618.16 applies with respect to the dog as

division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog

of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this state
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this chapter,
R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the possession of
chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance
included in Schedule I, Schedule II, Schedule III, Schedule IV or Schedule V, a
laboratory report from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or
established as described in this division that is signed by the person
performing the analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the
alleged offense have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to
the content, weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie
evidence of the content, identity and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity
and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance if the
accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the person signing
the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney, within seven
days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the report. The
time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. The portion shall be a representative sample of
the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the basis
of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion of the
court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific analysis
concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The prosecuting
attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample portion at least
14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a court not of record
or unless the accused person is charged with a minor misdemeanor, in which case
the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least three days prior to trial. If the prosecuting attorney
determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved and given to the
accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform the accused person,
or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the accused person is
entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have the
accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst present at an analysis
of the substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the alleged
violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all recorded
scientific data that result from the analysis and that can be used by an
analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings or opinions concerning the
identity of the substance or substances subject to the analysis.

any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or R.C. Chapter 2925
or Chapter 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of R.C. § 2925.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.
(R.C. § 2925.51)

R.C. §§ 2929.18 and 2929.28 and to any costs otherwise authorized or required
under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an offender who is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order the offender to
pay to the state, municipal or county law enforcement agencies that handled the
investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was the
basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may
hold the hearing as part of the sentencing hearing for the offender.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,

defendant knew was pregnant at the time of the offense) that was included in
the indictment, count in the indictment or information charging the offense,
the court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term as provided in
R.C. § 2929.24(F).

   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or
her knowledge that may have a bearing on the investigation of the death.

      (2)   No physician, nurse, physician assistant, or limited practitioner
who, outside a hospital, sanitarium or other medical facility, attends or

law enforcement authorities.

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding R.C. §
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered

resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.

patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be

relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. § 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to that member of the clergy in that member’s capacity as a
member of the clergy by a person seeking the aid or counsel of that member of
the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for persons with drug dependencies or persons
in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of R.C. § 2907.02 or R.C. § 2907.05 or to victims of felonious
sexual penetration in violation of former R.C. § 2907.12. As used in this
division, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (i)   Whoever violates division (a) or (b) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime. Violation of division (a)(1) of this section is a

section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.

giving it.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to aid a law
enforcement officer, a minor misdemeanor.

or impedes a public official in the performance of the public official’s lawful
duties.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing official
business. Except as otherwise provided in this division, obstructing official
business is a misdemeanor of the second degree. If a violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, obstructing official business is
a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2921.31)

a delinquent child for committing, a violation of division (a) of this section
regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to or is adjudicated a
delinquent child for committing the crime or act the person or child aided
committed. The crime or act the person or child aided committed shall be used
under division (c) of this section in determining the penalty for violation of
division (a) of this section, regardless of whether the person or child aided
ultimately is apprehended for, is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty
to or is adjudicated a delinquent child for committing the crime or act the

having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk

of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

active duty service member, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance
to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall
be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by
R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved
in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43,
whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a
victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C.
§ 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in
all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))
§ 672.04 DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of §
672.01 or 672.02 is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if
the property involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies
the account on which it is to be drawn, and that has not been executed by the
drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer’s or
importer’s certificate to a motor vehicle, as prescribed by R.C. § 4505.07;
   (e)   A blank form for any license listed in R.C. § 4507.01.

or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.
(R.C. § 2913.72)

rendered through the meter, conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or
control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in R.C. § 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water
meter, conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the
utility, proof that a meter, conduit or attachment disconnected by a utility
has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima facie evidence
that the person in possession or control of the meter, conduit or attachment at
the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment
with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (c)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   DANGEROUS OFFENDER. A person who has committed an offense, whose
history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she will
be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences.
   (b)   REPEAT OFFENDER. A person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or
she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a person is a
“repeat offender” if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in R.C. § 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
R.C. § 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or more
of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or

misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(R.C. § 2935.36(E))
§ 698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or
2947.19 and 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in §§
666.99 and 698.03 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail
term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other
than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a Department of
Probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the Department of Probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the Department of Probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e) or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
(f)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by

               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of

following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender’s payment history available to the victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
§ 698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
666.99 or
698.02 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in §
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$1,000.
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
that penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(R.C. § 2929.31)
§ 698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C)
or 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term or sentence of imprisonment
shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term or sentence
of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the state, another
state or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this
section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be
served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony
served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or
4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional
institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 698.06 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other provision of
the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this code of ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this code of ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
code of ordinances is substantially equivalent.

unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this chapter
that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in

operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

820.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §

the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the village,

corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

Withholding provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
820.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in §
820.10, of .75%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the village the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
            Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         C.   Intentionally left blank.

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed,
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been

         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding

withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales

contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,

of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that

of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the village;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the village in accordance with this chapter on the

portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the village may continue to file

year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the

days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
820.18(a)(4).

§ 820.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
820.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by §
820.12(e) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in §
820.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended village return showing income subject to the

   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
820.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
820.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
820.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division §
820.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the village income tax or related penalties

      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-09, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 820.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-09, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 820.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS means an address to which the postal service
or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver
an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery
is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-09, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 820.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the village that arises pursuant to the village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person,
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-09, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 820.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-09, passed 10-5-2015)
§ 820.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by village ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the village or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)   RETURN includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or the

         A.   Any return required to be filed under applicable law for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the village any return required to be filed, the following

§ 820.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the village or for the withholding of
such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
820.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §

respect to that information as required under division (c) of this section

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
820.99 for a violation of §
820.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against

or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear

   Village Council finds and determines that the Commercial Point Residential
Incentive District will place additional demand on the public infrastructure
improvements. Pursuant to the TIF Statutes, Village Council creates the
Incentive District, the boundaries of which are coextensive with the boundaries
of, and include, the parcels specifically identified and depicted in Exhibit A,
attached to Ordinance 2016-12.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 11-7-2016)
§ 824.02 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.
   Village Council designates the public infrastructure improvements described
in Exhibit B attached to Ordinance 2016-12, and any other public infrastructure
improvements hereafter designated by ordinance as public infrastructure
improvements, as public infrastructure improvements made, to be made or in the
process of being made by the village that directly benefit or serve, or that
once made will benefit or serve, parcels in the Incentive District.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 11-7-2016)
§ 824.03 AUTHORIZATION OF TAX EXEMPTION; LIFE OF INCENTIVE DISTRICT.
   Pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of R.C. § 5709.40(C),
Village Council declares that 100% of the increase in assessed value of each
parcel subsequent to the effective date of this chapter (which increase in
assessed value is hereinafter referred to as the "Improvement," as defined in
R.C. § 5709.40(A)) is a public purpose and exempt from taxation for a period
coextensive with the life of the Incentive District, which life commences with
the first tax year that begins after the effective date of this chapter and in
which an improvement attributable to a new structure would first appear on the
tax list and duplicate of real and public utility property for any parcel
within the Incentive District were it not for the exemption granted in this
chapter and ends on the earlier of 30 years after such commencement  or the
date on which the village can no longer require service payments in lieu of

the improvement allocable thereto to the Pickaway County Treasurer (the "County
Treasurer") on or before the final dates for payment of real property taxes.
Each service payment in lieu of taxes, including any penalties and interest at
the then current rate established under R.C. §§ 323.121 and 5703.47
(collectively, the "service payments"), will be charged and collected in the
same manner and in the same amount as the real property taxes that would have
been charged and payable against the improvement if it were not subject to the
exemption granted in this chapter. The service payments, and any other payments
with respect to each improvement that are received by the County Treasurer in
connection with the reduction required by R.C. §§ 319.302, 321.24, 323.152 and
323.156, as the same may be amended from time to time, or any successor
provisions thereto as the same may be amended from time to time (the "property
tax rollback payments"), will be allocated and distributed in accordance with §
824.06.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 11-7-2016)
§ 824.05 TAX INCREMENT EQUIVALENT FUND.
   Village Council establishes, pursuant to and in accordance with the
provisions of R.C. § 5709.43, the Commercial Point Municipal Public Improvement
Tax Increment Equivalent Fund (the "TIF Fund"), into which the County Treasurer
will deposit the service payments and property tax rollback payments collected
with respect to the parcels and not required to be distributed to the Teays
Valley Local School District pursuant to §
824.06. The TIF Fund will be maintained in the custody of the village. The
village may use amounts deposited into the TIF Fund only for the purposes
authorized in the TIF Statutes and this chapter. The TIF Fund will exist so
long as such service payments and property tax rollback payments are collected
and used for the aforesaid purposes, after which time the TIF Fund will be
dissolved and any surplus funds remaining therein transferred to the village's
General Fund, all in accordance with R.C. § 5709.43.
(Ord. 2016-12, passed 11-7-2016)
§ 824.06 DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.

distribute the service payments and the property tax rollback payments as
follows:
   (a)   To each of the Teays Valley Local School District and the Eastland
Joint Vocational School District, an amount equal to the amount the Teays
Valley Local School District and the Eastland Joint Vocational School District
would otherwise have received as real property tax payments (including the
applicable portion of any property tax rollback payments) derived from the
improvement to the property located within each such school district's
boundaries if the improvement had not been exempt from taxation pursuant to
this chapter; and
   (b)   To the village, all remaining amounts for further deposit into TIF
Fund for payment of costs of the public infrastructure improvements, including
debt service on any securities issued to finance those costs.

chapter, not substantially adverse to the village and approved by the Mayor and
the Village Solicitor. The Mayor, for and in the name of the village, is hereby

along with any changes or completions thereto, provided that the approval of
such changes and completions thereto by the Mayor, and the character of those
changes and completions as not being substantially adverse to the village, will

(Ord. 2016-12, passed 11-7-2016)
§ 824.08 FURTHER AUTHORIZATIONS.
   Village Council authorizes and directs the Mayor, the Fiscal Officer, the
Village Solicitor, the Clerk of Council or other appropriate officers of the

§ 1042.09 NON-ACCEPTABLE WASTEWATER AND COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT..
   (a)   Commercial Point shall make and enforce rules and regulations
establishing the types and characteristics of sewage, commercial/industrial
wastes, and other matters which shall be discharged into the sanitary sewerage
system, the types and characteristics of sewage and commercial/industrial
wastes admissible to the system only after pretreatment, requisites for
pretreatment, and otherwise governing the discharge of sewage, commercial/
industrial wastes, and other matters into the system in the interest of safety,
and efficient operation of the wastewater treatment plant. Applicable
commercial/industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial pretreatment
regulations, as promulgated under Section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act, are
hereby incorporated in this section and made a part thereof.
   (b)   A commercial establishment/industry must, upon application for sewer
service, present to Commercial Point a tabulation of the chemical analysis of
the wastes to be discharged into the sewerage system and the volume of such
wastes, or if this is not available, the expected waste analysis based on
similar processes now in operation.
   (c)   In cases where the character of sewage or commercial/industrial waste
from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that
it will damage the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
Water Reclamation Facility, Commercial Point shall require such users to
dispose of such waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (d)   In cases where the character of the sewage or commercial/industrial
waste from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such
that it imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage collection, pumping, or
treatment works greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering the
sewerage system, Commercial Point may: compel such manufacturing or industrial
plant, building, or premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as
specified by Commercial Point before discharging it into the sewerage system;
require flow control or equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug"
loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works; or require
payment of a surcharge, as determined on a case by case basis, on any excessive
flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional
costs of having capacity for and treating such wastes.
   (e)   The discharge of non-acceptable commercial/industrial sewage into the
sewerage system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater
shall be deemed non-acceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic
substances in the wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic
or harmful substances include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
Toxic or Harmful Substances Tolerable Limits
Toxic or Harmful Substances Tolerable Limits
Arsenic                     0.2 mg/l

                            per liter.
 
The preceding list of toxic or harmful substances is subject to revisions as
required to meet current water quality standards or effluent standards imposed
by state or federal agencies. In special cases (low volume users), the
concentration of toxic or harmful substances in the wastewater may be exceeded
if it is determined by Commercial Point that the total pounds of toxic or
harmful substances discharged to the sewage system are not harmful to or will
not interfere with the sewage treatment process or will not violate water
quality or effluent standards.
   (f)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, either directly

all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions of the sewer and
with no particle greater than one-half inch in any dimension.
      (10)   Any water or wastes containing suspended solids of such character
or quality that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such
materials at the sewage treatment plant, or having a chlorine demand greater
than 25 mg/l.
      (11)   Any waste containing substances that would result in a violation
of the NPDES permit.
      (12)   Any unused medication including but not limited to prescription
drugs and over the counter medication.
      (13)   The above list is subject to revisions as required to meet current
water quality standards imposed by the state or federal agencies.
   (g)   No statement contained in this section shall be interpreted as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between Commercial Point and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by Commercial Point for treatment. In all such cases,
the provisions set forth in the Commercial Point ordinance establishing sewer
service charges will be governing factors in any contracts entered into.
   (h)   Grease, oil, sand and trash interceptors shall be installed at the
expense of the owner when, in
the opinion of Commercial Point, they are necessary for proper handling of
liquid wastes containing excessive amounts of grease, any flammable wastes,
sand, trash, and/or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily removable
covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. Where
installed, all grease, oil and sand and trash interceptors shall be maintained
by the owner at his or her expense, in continuous efficient operation at all
times.
   (i)   Any commercial/industrial user who has discharge to the sanitary sewer
system, and is compelled by the Ohio Plumbing Code and/or Commercial Point to
install and maintain a grease oil, sand, and/or trash interceptor shall have
the interceptor serviced by a properly accredited service provider at a minimum
of every 90 days. Proper maintenance of interceptors includes the complete
removal and disposal of all contents, liquid and solid. This frequency of
interceptor service is subject to modification as determined by Commercial
Point. Cleaning by gravimetric separation is strictly prohibited. The owner/
operator of interceptors shall maintain a record, including receipts, of
interceptor service on the premise and be prepared to display records upon
request. These records are to be kept a minimum of three years. Dischargers
must allow full inspection of any pretreatment units, including maintenance
records, at any time when requested by a duly authorized agent of Commercial
Point. Additionally, each discharger must mail copies of quarterly service
reports to Commercial Point by no later than the 15th of the month following
this service.
   (j)   Any person, firm, or corporation who violates or fails to comply with
a provision of this section shall be prosecuted within the limits provided by
state and local laws, specifically §
1042.99.

   (c)   When accurate meter readings cannot be obtained at the time of a
scheduled meter reading, or where necessary for administrative purposes, the
quantity of water used may be estimated for sewer billing purposes. Estimated
usage will be based upon actual meter readings from prior cycles or by such
other fair and reasonable methods. Where unmetered wastewater is discharged to
the sewer system without adequate sewer metering, the village reserves the
right to bill the amount of flow based upon its engineering judgment of a
reasonable estimate of unmetered usage. Where the usage is estimated because of
inability to read the meter, any necessary corrections shall be made at the
time of the next actual meter reading or when appropriate. The village may
modify any sewer service charge as set forth in this section if the property
owner demonstrates to the village that the water or wastewater measured by the
owner's meter is greater than that actually being discharged directly or
indirectly into the village sewer system, but no charge resulting from any such
modification shall be less than the amount of the minimum bill per month set
forth in this section.
   (d)   Each sewer charge levied pursuant to this chapter is made a lien upon
and against the premises charged, and if the charge is not paid within 30 days
after it becomes due and payable, it shall be certified by the village to the
Auditor of Pickaway County, Ohio, who shall place the charge on the tax list
and duplicate with the interest and penalties provided by law, to be collected
as other municipal taxes are collected.

criteria and procedures to be used for storm sewer design.
         A.   The rational method shall be used for all storm water drainage
design for areas up to 200 acres. Storm sewers shall be designed to carry a
two-year storm flowing full Q=CIA, in which
            Q = Quantity of storm water runoff in cubic feet per second.
            C = Coefficient of runoff (0.4 for single-family residential
areas).
            I = Average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for the period of
concentration to the point under consideration. The minimum length of time of
concentration is ten minutes to a curb inlet or l5 minutes to a ditch catch
basin.
            A = Drainage area in acres tributary to the point of concentration.
         B.   For drainage areas over 200 acres, the method explained in "Urban
Hydrology for Small Watershed, Technical Release No. 55" (can be obtained from
the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture) shall be used.
      (2)   The minimum time of concentration to the first curb inlet shall be
ten minutes. The minimum time of concentration to the first catch basin shall
be l5 minutes.
      (3)   Storm sewer pipe sizes are to be determined by using Manning's
Formula with a minimum coefficient of roughness of n = .013.
      (4)   The minimum allowable velocity shall be three feet per second (fps)
in pipe. The maximum allowable velocity shall be seven fps.
      (5)   A hydraulic grade line check based on a five-year storm may be
required, at the discretion of the Village Engineer.
   (d)   Open Watercourses.
      (1)   Access to storm drainage ditches and channels shall be assured by
means of maintenance easements. Such maintenance easements shall be not less
than 20 feet in width, measured horizontally from the top of the bank,
exclusive of the width of the ditch, or channel, and shall be provided on each
side of the ditch. Maintenance easements are to be kept free of obstructions.
Detailed provisions regarding the entities to be responsible for maintenance of
the facility shall be submitted in text form with the subdivision plat. As
applicable, notes regarding maintenance shall be made on the plat.
      (2)   Design storm frequency for open channels shall be based on bank
full for ten-year storm, with a one foot freeboard.
      (3)   A.   The minimum velocity for open channels shall be two feet per
second. The maximum velocity is dependent on the type of channel protection
provided. The desirable minimum grade for open channel is 1.0%.
         B.   The Manning "n" values shall be as follows:
            Sod or jute mat lining   0.05
            Paving lining         0.015
            Rock Protection         0.08
         C.   The Municipal Engineer on a case-by-case basis will review
Manning "n" values for other lining materials.
         D.   The minimum side slope shall be 3:1 for unprotected slopes and 2:
l for slopes protected with riprap. Flatter slopes are more desirable. Steeper
slopes for materials other than riprap will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis.
      (4)   If the proposed improvements are located in a floodplain area as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the limits of this
floodway and floodway fringes must be shown on the improvement plans.
   (e)   Storm Water Detention.
      (1)   If the post-development runoff volume is greater than the
predevelopment runoff volume, storm water detention must be provided in
accordance with the following table:
 
Increase in 2-year Volume Control Design Frequency (Critical Storm)
of Runoff
1 - 2 Times               10-year
2 - 3 Times               25-year
3 - 4 Times               50-year
Over 4 Times              100-Year
 
      (2)   The maximum allowable release rate shall be based on the two-year
storm under pre-developed site conditions, for all rainfall events up to and
including the critical storm. The maximum allowable release rate for storms
greater than the critical storm shall not exceed the pre-developed rate for the
same frequency storm, for storms up to and including the 100-year storm.
      (3)   "Total Runoff Volume Computations Worksheet," in the Village of
Commercial Point Specification, Materials, and Standard Drawings Manual should
be used to determine predeveloped and post developed runoff volumes, runoff
volumes for critical storm, and required detention volume calculations.
      (4)   Detention basins shall be lined with riprap or other bank
protection as approved by the Village Engineer, extending at least three feet
horizontally and two feet vertically from the established water table line.
Soils information shall be provided to demonstrate that the retention basis
will be impervious.
      (5)   All wet basins shall have fountains approved by Council. Dry basins
must have concrete channels to handle low flows.
      (6)   Detention basins shall have a minimum 1% slope.
      (7)   All control facilities shall be designed with overflow provisions
to handle the developed 100-year discharge.
      (8)   The maintenance of detention basins and all outlets thereto shall
be the responsibility of the property owner or property owners' association, as
applicable and not the Village of Commercial Point. Such maintenance shall
ensure that water in each detention basin through the detention basin outlet
does not restrict the flow of the public storm sewer system.

improvement plans and the subdivision regulations. The developer or designated
representative shall contact the Planning and Zoning Administrator to schedule
a meeting with municipal officials during the 11th month of the first year of
the maintenance bond to perform an inspection of the improvements. Any
deficiencies shall be documented in writing and provided to the developer who
shall take appropriate action in addressing said deficiencies.
      (2)   After all deficiencies, if any, have been addressed to the
satisfaction of the municipality, the maintenance bond may be reduced in an
amount determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator to cover street
improvements for an additional four years.
      (3)   No certificate of zoning compliance or building permit shall be
issued in the approved subdivision, or section thereof, until the required
maintenance bond is accepted.
   (e)   Release of Performance Bond and "As Built" Drawings. Request for the
release of a performance bond upon completion of all required improvements
including "punch list" items must include "as built" drawings to include any
changes from the approved improvement plans, including grading plan for storm

§ 1141.12 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS.
   (a)   Purpose and Intent. The environmental analysis is intended to protect
the environmental integrity of land within the municipality and address
identified municipal concerns. This provision is also intended to ensure ample
provisions for the efficient use of land and to promote high standards in
layout and design. The environmental analysis supplements the provisions of the
Subdivision Regulations and site development plans. The purpose of this section
is to state the specific requirements applicable to the development of land in
environmentally sensitive areas, and to prescribe the standards for the
preparation and submission of an environmental analysis.
   (b)   Environmental Analysis Required. Before any use or development
involving new construction, reconstruction or expansion of structures can
begin, an environmental analysis shall be required and shall be submitted if
any portion of the parcel(s) meets one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   The parcel is located in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The parcel contains one or more wetlands.
      (3)   Fifteen percent or more of the soil is hydric or contains hydric
soil inclusions.
      (4)   The parcel contains a stream or other natural water feature.
      (5)   The parcel contains an agricultural drainage ditch.
      (6)   Twenty-five percent or more of the total area of the parcel has
slopes over 20%.
      (7)   Twenty-five percent or more of the site is woodlands, as defined in
Chapter 1133.
   (c)   Exemptions. No zoning district shall be exempt from this requirement.
   (d)   Preparation. The environmental analysis shall be prepared by persons
professionally qualified to do such work. Every analysis shall consist of a map
identifying all of the features outlined in division (b) of this section and a
report detailing the approximate size of each of the features illustrated on
the map and the mitigation strategies that will be used by the owner/developer
in these areas. The map shall be prepared at a scale of one inch equals 500
feet or less. One copy of the map and report shall be submitted to the Planning
and Zoning Administrator for review.
   (e)   Decision. Once the environmental analysis is submitted to the Planning
and Zoning Administrator, the Planning and Zoning Administrator has ten
calendar days to review the analysis. If the Planning and Zoning Administrator
determines that the analysis is complete, the Planning and Zoning Administrator
shall certify such in writing to the property owner/developer. If the Planning
and Zoning Administrator determines that the environmental analysis is
incomplete or lacks utilization of the most current data, the Planning and
Zoning Administrator shall certify such in writing to the property owner/
developer. The property owner/developer then has ten calendar days to submit a
revised analysis for consideration.

CHAPTER 1159
Optional Traditional Neighborhood Development Floating District (TND)
1159.01   Purpose.
1159.02   Design objectives.
1159.03   Definitions.
1159.04   Minimum and maximum size, density of TND.
1159.05   General development criteria.
1159.06   Land use categories.
1159.07   Ownership and maintenance of common area(s) and civic use buildings.
1159.08   Applicability.
§ 1159.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this district is to allow the optional development of
land consistent with the design principles of "traditional" neighborhoods.
These principles provide an opportunity for diversification and integration of
land uses including residential, retail, office, recreation, etc., within close
proximity to one another, thereby providing for many of the daily needs of the
inhabitants of the neighborhood.
   (b)   The district is designed to be self-contained, tightly gridded, and
pedestrian-oriented to encourage socializing, walking, and other aspects of a
vibrant outdoor urban experience. The traditional neighborhood district (TND)
is an optional zoning district/category.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1159.02 DESIGN OBJECTIVES.
   The provisions of this district are intended to establish a neighborhood
which:
   (a)   Is physically recognizable and limited in size.
   (b)   Places residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings in close
proximity to one another within the neighborhood, thereby maximizing
transportation choice and reducing the number and length of motor vehicle
trips, traffic congestion, and need for road widening. Compatibility of
buildings, uses, and other improvements is determined by their arrangement,
scale, character, and landscaping to establish a livable, harmonious, and
diverse environment.
   (c)   Establishes a hierarchy of streets serving equitably the needs of the
pedestrian, the bicyclist, the bus rider, and the motorist. Streets are
interconnected and blocks are small.
   (d)   Places civic buildings and squares in prominent locations that act as
landmarks, symbols and focal points for community identity. Such buildings and
squares provide places of assembly for social activities.
   (e)   Links civic buildings, squares, and parks with pedestrian paths and
greenways to provide places for social activity and recreation.
   (f)   Includes private buildings forming a consistent, distinct edge,
spatially delineating the public street space and the private block interior.
   (g)   Includes architecture and landscape that are consistent with the
unique character of the region.
   (h)   Provides defined public spaces such as streets and squares, allowing
citizens to know each other and watch over their collective security.
   (i)   Provides a full range of housing types and work places, allowing all
age groups and economic classes to integrate in an authentic community.
   (j)   Provides trees of the same size, shape or type to create visual
continuity and a unified.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1159.03 DEFINITIONS.
   The following definitions shall be applicable in the TND District. When
there are conflicts between the terms used herein and definitions as provided
elsewhere in the Zoning Code, the provisions of this district shall take
precedence. Terms used throughout this district shall take their commonly
accepted meaning unless otherwise defined in this Zoning Code. Terms requiring
interpretation specific to this district are as follows:
   "A" STREET. A street which is designed with, or otherwise characterized by,
features that promote the safety, comfort, and convenience of pedestrians, and
does so in a relatively exceptional way. Such streets typically feature
sidewalks at least five feet wide, narrow streets, buildings pulled up close to
the street, no front yard off-street parking, pedestrian-scaled lighting, on-
street parking, landscaped medians, articulated building walls, aligned
building facades, a building entrance on the street, modest turning radii,
trash receptacles remote from the sidewalk, and outdoor mechanical equipment on
the side, rear or roof of buildings.
   ALLEY. A vehicular passageway providing secondary and/or service access to
the sides or rear of building lots.
   ARTISANAL USE. The manufacture and sale of artifacts utilizing only hand-
held and/or table-mounted electrical tools. Such a use must be contained within
a completely enclosed building.
   BLOCK. The gross area of lots and adjacent alleys, circumscribed by streets.
   CIVIC BUILDING. A building, either publicly or privately owned, located on a
civic lot used for any permitted or required civic use.
   COLONNADE. A roof or building structure, extending over the sidewalk, open
to the street and sidewalk except for supporting columns or piers. Awnings are
permitted within the TND but are not considered colonnades. Colonnades shall
not cause roof drainage into the public right-of-way.
   CORNICE LINE. A molded and projecting horizontal member that crowns an
architectural composition. A cornice line shall project a minimum of two inches
from the front elevation of the structure.
   DRIVE-THROUGH. Establishments which provide services or sales that are
extended mechanically or personally to customers who do not exit their
motorized vehicle. Such facilities include banking facilities, restaurants,
food sales, dry cleaning, express mail services and other services. Not
included in this definition are auto fuel pumps and depositories which involve
no immediate exchange or dispersal to the customer, such as mailboxes, library
book depositories and recycling facilities.
   EDGE AREA. A continuous open area which defines and buffers the edge of a
TND and each neighborhood proper. Edge areas shall be preserved in perpetuity
to buffer adjacent land uses, preserve natural areas, and provide linked
greenway corridors.
   FORMAL LANDSCAPING. Street trees or shrubs that form an aligned street wall
parallel to the street. When used, brick-paved sidewalks or tree grates may be
required to be constructed using engineered soil to accommodate root growth for
long-term tree stability and infrastructural compatibility. This tree
arrangement forms an intimate, comfortable, dignified public place along a
corridor. The arrangement is often useful to visually "narrow down" a corridor
when facing buildings on a street are set too far apart or are of insufficient
height to establish a comfortable street width to building height ratio of 3:
1 to 1:1.
   FRONT PORCH. An un-air conditioned roofed structure attached to the front
and along a side walked street side of the unit, having a minimum depth of six
feet and a minimum width of 12 feet. Except for insect screening and supporting
columns, front porches shall not be enclosed above the minimum railing height
allowed by the Standard Building Code. All or a portion of the front porch may
encompass a ramp providing handicap access. Front porches may encroach up to
ten feet beyond the build-to line.
   FRONTAGE. That side of a lot abutting a street right-of-way. When a lot
abuts more than one street, it is that side that abuts the more primary street
or the street designed for the highest pedestrian volume. For a corner lot, all
sides abutting a street shall be considered frontage.
   LODGING USE. Buildings providing food service and bedrooms for rent or
lease.
   LODGING USE, LIMITED. The provision of no more than four bedrooms for rent
or lease. Food service may be included between the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00
a.m. The maximum length of stay shall not exceed 14 consecutive days.
   LOT OR BUILDING LOT. A separately platted portion of private land, not
including the specified sidewalk area.
   MEETING HALL. A building designed for public assembly.
   NEIGHBORHOOD PROPER. The built-up area planned for development within a TND,

areas and through streets.
   OFFICE USE, LIMITED. The transaction of business or the supply of
professional services, employing no more than eight persons.
   OUTBUILDING. A detached accessory use building on a residential lot, for
residential, parking, or storage use only.
   PARK. A public open space whose area is delineated by the surrounding
building frontage lines within the neighborhood proper. Parks shall be
surrounded by building frontage lines on at least 50% of the park's perimeter.
   PEDESTRIAN PATHWAYS. Interconnecting paved walkways that provide pedestrian
passage through blocks running from street to street. For the purposes of this
district, pathways are not sidewalks.
   PLAZA. An open space area within a town center on which many or all
shopfront lots front. Plazas shall be limited to parking, landscaping, and
permanent architectural and/or water oriented features.
   PRIVATE OPEN SPACE. That space on each building lot that is for the private
use of the inhabitants of such lot. Said space shall be unenclosed except for
being fenced or walled, and open to the sky except for roofed porches. Atriums,
gardens, garden courts, walks, patios, and other similar spaces shall count as
private open space. Up to one third of the private open space area may be a
roof terrace.
   SCREENING WALL. A wall made of fieldstone, brick, stucco, wrought-iron (or
equivalent to wrought-iron), or wood picket excluding round industrial railing
and chain link fence.
   SQUARE. An outdoor public civic tract whose area is defined by streets or
adjacent buildings. Squares shall include streets on at least three sides.
Squares shall be surrounded by shopfronts, rowhouses, or civic use lots on at
least 60% of their perimeter. No more than 40% of the square may be used for
parking.
   STREETEDGE. The vertical face formed by building facades, street trees, and
screening walls which is aligned along a street and forms a comfortable people-
scaled space.
   STREET VISTA. A view through or along a street centerline which is at least
600 feet in length.
   THROUGH STREET. A major collector or arterial street which serves more than
one neighborhood, or carries traffic between neighborhoods proper.
   TOWN CENTER. An optional and accessory use to the TND providing for larger
scale commercial shopfront uses in buildings that front a plaza.
   VERTICAL INTEGRATION. Mixed, dissimilar land uses are contained within the
same building usually on different floors of a multi-story building. By
contrast, a horizontal integration represents a mix of land uses that are near
each other but in separate buildings.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1159.04 MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SIZE, DENSITY OF TND.
   All applications for a TND shall comply with the following development

when such lots front a square, park and/or plaza. Otherwise, parallel parking
is encouraged.
      (12)   Shopfront use lots and rowhouse use lots may front on a square or
park tract. In addition, a public access easement shall provide for public
passage for shopfront use sidewalks - excepting an area within four feet of the
shopfronts which may be occupied by furniture for restaurants.
      (13)   For house use lot streets, planting strips are required on each
side. However, a parallel parking lane may be used in place of either planting

restrictive provisions shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter
shall be governed by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning
Code.
   (e)   Relationship to the Subdivision Regulations. The uniqueness of each
proposal for a Planned Conservation Development (PCND) may require that there
be modification from the specifications established in the Subdivision
Regulations of Commercial Point, Ohio. Modifications may be incorporated into
the plan by the developer only after the review of the Planning and Zoning
Administrator.
   (f)   Utilities. The following regulations apply to the provision of
utilities in planned conservation developments.
      (1)   Planned Conservation Developments (PCND) shall have an adequate
source of potable water. All water lines constructed within a planned

be financially responsible for the extension of the existing network of
sanitary sewage lines to serve the planned development area. No construction of
buildings within any segment of a planned conservation development shall be
commenced until after the extension of sanitary sewage lines has been
completed.
      (3)   The following utility equipment shall be provided, constructed and
installed underground within a planned development: gas lines, sanitary and
storm sewer lines, water lines, electrical lines, telephone lines, and cable
television lines.
      (4)   All utility systems shall be located and designed in such a manner
and method as to preserve the natural features of the land such as streams,
rock outcropping, topsoil, trees and shrubs and the same shall be incorporated
into and with the landscaping of said lands.
      (5)   Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall
be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of adequate width to
facilitate the proposed usage.
      (6)   All utility boxes shall be screened.
   (g)   Storm Water Management. Due to the size and nature of planned
conservation developments and the fact that several types of developments may
be exempt from platting requirements, all site plans must have a storm water
management plan, approved by the Municipal Engineer, with the improvements
constructed before a zoning certificate will be issued for construction of
buildings.
   (h)   Walkways. All Planned Conservation Developments (PCND) where the
average lot frontage is less than 90 feet shall be provided with concrete
sidewalks on both sides of the street throughout the development. All other
walkways shall be constructed of a suitable, dust free, hard surface material.
Mulch or other similar surfaces may be permitted for walking trails in areas
Council feels are appropriate.
   (i)   Trees.
      (1)   The clearing of land shall be kept to a minimum to help preserve
the existing natural conditions.
      (2)   No land shall be cleared of trees eight to ten feet away from the
existing tree canopy. An exception to this requirement shall be granted in the
case of those trees which should be removed due to malformation, disease,
safety hazards, or to the general benefit of surrounding trees. The foregoing
shall be considered as a guideline for preservation of the natural environment.

the municipality on the association. The association may establish rules to
ensure proper maintenance of property, including monetary liens on the homes
and home sites of its members who fail to pay their association dues in a
timely manner. Such liens may impose a penalty of interest charges.
         E.   The members of the association shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing, where appropriate, such undivided common open
space. Shares shall be defined within the association bylaws.
         F.   In the event of transfer, within the methods here permitted, of
undivided common open space land by the homeowners association, or the
assumption of maintenance of undivided common open space land by the
municipality, notice of such pending action shall be given to all property
owners within the development.
         G.   The association shall provide for adequate staff to administer
common facilities and property and continually maintain the undivided common
open space.
         H.   The lease shall be subject to the approval of the homeowners
association board and any transfer or assignment of the lease shall be further
subject to the approval of the board. Lease agreements shall be recorded with
the Franklin County or Pickaway County Recorders Office, whichever is
applicable, and notification shall be provided to Council within 30 calendar
days of action by the board.
         I.   The homeowners association may lease common open space lands to
any other qualified person, or corporation, for operation and maintenance of
common open space lands, but such a lease agreement shall provide:
            1.   That the residents of the development shall at all times have
access to the common open space lands contained therein (except croplands
during the growing season);
            2.   That the undivided common open space shall be maintained for
purposes set forth in this chapter; and
            3.   That the operation of common open space facilities may be for
the benefit of the residents only, or may be open to all residents of the
municipality, at the election of the developer and/or homeowners association.
In cases where public trails or paths are provided as linkage between
developments or as a continuous link of common open space within the
municipality, all residents of the municipality shall have access to such
identified paths/walkways.
      (3)   Condominiums. The undivided common open space and associated
facilities may be controlled through the use of condominium agreements,
approved by the municipality. Such agreements shall be in conformance with all
applicable laws and regulations. All undivided common open space land shall be
held as a "common element".
      (4)   Dedication of easements. The municipality may, but shall not be
required to, accept easements for public use of any portion or portions of
undivided common open space land, title of which is to remain in ownership by
condominium or homeowners association, provided:
         A.   Such land is accessible to municipal residents;
         B.   There is no cost of acquisition other than incidental transfer of
ownership costs; and
         C.   A satisfactory maintenance agreement is reached between the
developer, association and the municipality.
      (5)   Transfer of easements to a private conservation organization. With
the permission of the municipality, an owner may transfer easements to a
private, nonprofit organization, among whose purposes it is to conserve open
space and/or natural resources, provided that:
         A.   The organization is acceptable to the municipality, and is a bona
fide conservation organization with perpetual existence;
         B.   The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for the proper
reverter or retransfer in the event that organization becomes unwilling or
unable to continue carrying out its function; and,
         C.   A maintenance agreement acceptable to Council is entered into by

§ 1173.08 MAINTENANCE OF OPEN SPACE IN PCND.
   (a)   The ultimate owner of the open space shall be responsible for raising
all monies required for operations, maintenance, or physical improvements to
the open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc. The owner shall
be authorized under its bylaws to place liens on the property of residents who
fall delinquent in payment of such dues, assessments, etc.
   (b)   In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space shall at any time after establishment of the planned
development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the final development plan, the Planning and
Zoning Administrator may serve written notice upon such organization or upon
the residents of the planned conservation development setting forth the manner
in which the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies
of maintenance be cured within 30 calendar days thereof, and shall state the
date and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 calendar days
of the notice. At such hearing Council may modify the terms of the original
notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which
they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in
the modifications thereof shall not be cured within said 30 calendar days or
any extension thereof, Council, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open space
from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year. Said entry and maintenance shall
not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space. Before the
expiration of said year, Council shall, upon its initiative or upon the request
of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the common
open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the
residents of the planned development, to be held by Council, at which hearing
such organization or the residents of the planned development shall show cause
why such maintenance by Council shall not, at the election of Council, continue
for a succeeding year. If Council determines such organization is ready and
able to maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, Council shall
cease to maintain said common open space at the end of said year. If Council
shall determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said common
open space in a reasonable condition, Council may, in its discretion, continue
to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding year and subject
to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. The decision
of Council in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision
subject to review as provided by law.
   (c)   The cost of such maintenance by the municipality shall be assessed
against the properties within the planned development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. The municipality, at the time of entering upon said common open
space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the
office of the Franklin or Pickaway County Recorder, upon the properties
affected by such lien within the planned development.

§ 1175.04 STREAM CORRIDOR PROTECTION POLICY.
   (a)   Except as noted herein, no open channels (natural or man-made) will be
enclosed within a storm sewer when an area is developed. This policy will apply
even when the open watercourse is located on a property line.
   (b)   If exceptions are granted on any project, it will be with the
requirement that any enclosure will convey flow from the entire tributary
drainage area up to the ten-year recurrence interval. A flood routing flow path
must be provided through the development site for all storms greater than the
ten-year recurrence interval. This flood routing path must be clearly shown on
the site development plans.
   (c)   For all natural or manmade open channels, a stream corridor protection
zone (riparian setback) will be required. This zone shall be kept in as natural
a state as possible so that it can perform its inherent function of erosion
protection, flood storage and water quality protection.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1175.05 STREAM CORRIDOR PROTECTION ZONE.
   (a)   The Stream Corridor Protection Zone (SCPZ) for streams within
Commercial Point are shown as "preservation" land use areas in the Village of
Commercial Point Comprehensive Plan. A copy of the mapped protection zones may
be obtained from the Planning and Zoning Administrator. The setback width on
any specific parcel will be that area indicated on the Comprehensive Plan and
as determined by the Municipal Engineer calculated using the methodology
specified in Commercial Point's Specifications, Materials, and Standard
Drawings Manual.
   (b)   The SCPZ must be clearly shown on site development plans.
   (c)   All applicable state and federal regulations shall be followed,
including Sections 401 and 404 or the Clean Water Act. No exceptions to this
rule will be allowed to raise flood elevations upstream of the project.
   (d)   All conveyances and conduits containing a stream, if allowed, shall
have the capacity to carry a minimum of a ten-year design storm from the entire
upstream drainage area. In addition, a flood routing flow path shall be
included to carry the 100-year storm flow. This flood routing path must be
clearly shown on the site development plans, and the applicant shall provide
stormwater calculations for the proposed enclosure and flood routing to the
municipality for approval.
   (e)   Construction Limitations.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, the SCPZ shall be
preserved in its natural state.
      (2)   Prior to any earth moving or clearing and grubbing activity on a
development property, the SCPZ shall be clearly delineated by the applicant or
their designated representative on the site. Such delineation shall also be
identified on the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Plan (see §
1115.10) and this delineation shall be maintained throughout soil disturbing
activity.
      (3)   No later than the conclusion of construction, the applicant shall
permanently delineate the SCPZ in an aesthetically harmonious manner, approved
by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, such that the location of the
riparian setback boundary defining the SCPZ is apparent to the casual observer
and that permits access to the zone.
      (4)   Language preventing property owners from constructing facilities
and performing activities that are prohibited within the SCPZ shall be shown on
the plat or separate instrument and reflected on all deeds.
      (5)   Land contained within the SCPZ may, at the applicant's option and
if approved by Council, be deeded in fee simple to the municipality.
Alternatively, the land contained within the SCPZ shall be preserved via
dedicated conservation easement or reserve.
      (6)   The applicant shall obtain all necessary permits from the Army
Corps of Engineers, OEPA and other regulatory agencies as needed. The applicant
is responsible for all permitting fees.
   (f)   Post-Construction Requirements.
      (1)   Permitted uses and activities.
         A.   Passive uses. Uses that are passive in character shall be
permitted in the SCPZ, including but not limited to, passive recreational uses,
as permitted by federal, state, and local laws, such as hiking, fishing,
picnicking and similar uses. Construction of paved trails to further such
passive recreation uses are also permitted. However, trails that become damaged
due to natural erosion shall not be repaired but shall be moved upland or
removed altogether.
         B.   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees
may be removed. Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block watercourses or otherwise exacerbate
flooding, logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased
trees that are greater than six-inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut
into sections no longer than six-feet, anchored to the shore or removed.
         C.   Revegetation and/or reforestation. The Planning and Zoning
Administrator maintains a list of plant and shrub species recommended for
stabilizing flood prone areas. Proper selection of species is dependent on soil
conditions, available water and amount of sun exposure. Proper species
selection will take into account these factors.
         D.   Public utilities. Sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and/or water lines
and public utility transmission lines may be located within the riparian
setback and disturbances of the setback necessary to place and/or maintain such
utilities are also authorized. The placement, construction and maintenance of
such utilities shall minimize disturbance to riparian areas and shall mitigate
any necessary disturbances. The developer and/or landowner shall secure the
appropriate state and federal permits required for installations of this type.
Utilities that are parallel to the stream shall not be constructed or placed
within the SCPZ.
         E.   Public roadways. Public roadways may cross the riparian setback
and disturbances of the setback necessary to place and/or maintain the roadways
are authorized. The placement, construction and maintenance of the roadway
shall minimize disturbance to riparian areas and shall mitigate any necessary
disturbances. There shall be no more than two roadway crossings of the setback
within any proposed development. The developer and/or landowner shall secure
the appropriate state and federal permits required for installations of this
type.
         F.   Construction activities associated with properly permitted stream
restoration projects.
         G.   Disturbances resulting from permitted stream and/or wetland
mitigation projects provided that mitigation is to offset impacts to local
wetlands.
         H.   "Emergency channel maintenance activity" may be authorized by the
Village Engineer, as needed to restore and/or maintain the flood carrying
capacity of the main channel area. Such activity may include, but not be
limited to removal of offending trees or brush or the accumulation of sediment
in the main channel, as necessary to restore flood flow carrying capacity of
the main channel.
      (2)   Prohibited uses. Any use not authorized under these regulations
shall be prohibited in the SCPZ. By way of example, the following uses are
specifically prohibited, however prohibited uses are not limited to those
examples listed here.
         A.   Construction. There shall be no structures of any kind.
         B.   Dredging or filling. There shall be no drilling, filling,
dredging, grading or dumping of soils, spoils, liquid or solid materials. No
floodplain fill permits will be granted for areas within the SCPZ except those
that are required for activities listed as permitted uses above.
         C.   Motorized vehicles. There shall be no use of motorized vehicles
except as needed for activities associated with those listed as permitted uses
above.
         D.   Parking lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human made
impervious cover except as allowed above.
         E.   Stormwater detention facilities. Stormwater detention facilities
may be located adjacent to, but not within, the SCPZ unless otherwise approved
by the Planning and Zoning Administrator.
         F.   Platted lots. No part of any lot to be developed will be located
within the SCPZ.
      (3)   Non-conforming uses and structures within the SCPZ.
         A.   Any non-conforming use, existing at the time of passage of this
regulation and within a SCPZ that is not permitted under this regulation, may
be continued but shall not be changed to a new use or enlarged unless changed
to a use permitted under this regulation.
         B.   A non-conforming use, existing at the time of passage of this
regulation and within a SCPZ that is not permitted under this regulation, may
be continued but shall not have the existing building footprint or roofline
expanded or enlarged.
         C.   A non-conforming use, existing at the time of passage of this
regulation and within a SCPZ that has substantial damage and that is
discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a period of six months or more may
not be revived, restored or re-established. Substantial damage is defined in §
1149.04(d) as damages that equate to greater than half of the fair value of the
property.
   (g)   Maintenance of the Stream Corridor Protection Zone.
      (1)   Disturbance of natural vegetation. There shall be no disturbance of
the natural vegetation at any time, including construction of the remainder of
the site, except for such plantings as are consistent with these regulations;
for removal of invasive species and their replacement with native vegetation;
and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of landscaping or lawns
existing at the time of passage of these regulations except as needed for
activities associated with those listed above.
      (2)   Recommended vegetation for stabilizing floodprone areas. Proper
selection of species for stabilization of flood prone areas is dependent on
several factors, including soil conditions, available water and amount of sun
exposure. Proper species selection and installation will take into account
these factors. A list of appropriate plant species is maintained by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator.

§ 1177.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Commercial Point, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. Commercial Point, Ohio has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health,
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects,
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public,
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions,
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard,
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas,
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions,
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas,
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained,
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain,
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible, and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities,
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction,
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters,
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage, and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Commercial
Point, Ohio as identified in division (f) of this section, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by Commercial Point, Ohio.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map Pickaway County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas" and "Flood Insurance Study Pickaway County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas"
both effective September 19, 2007.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps that may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard include:
Floodplain Study in Franklin and Pickaway County, Ohio.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by Commercial Point, Ohio as required by §
1177.04(c).
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are part of the Village of Commercial Point Comprehensive Plan,
and may be reviewed at 10 West Scioto Street, Commercial Point, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements,
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of Commercial Point, Ohio, and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of Commercial Point, Ohio, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)

equipment or materials. (Note §
1153.13)
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
with flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by

500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood  profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation plus one and one-
half feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   FLOODWAY. 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-
27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from  flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the Commercial Point, Ohio Flood
Insurance Rate Map, June 4, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3)
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
(4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was  within 180 calendar days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its' before damaged condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction";
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the municipality's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
§
1177.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring,
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with division (c) of
this section.
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division (j)(1) of this section, prepared in a
format required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map
revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map
revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (j)(1) of
this section.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Commercial
Point, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation I detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
municipality have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
municipality's flood insurance rate map accurately represent the municipality
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
municipality suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the municipality has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps or flood insurance study
have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in §
1177.05 Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements;
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with increased cost of
compliance insurance claims.

resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
1177.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Commercial Point and the chief
executive officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Division (i)(1)B.1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
municipality specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in §
1177.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 1177.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board. Council shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
this chapter.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   Council shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is
an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with division (d) of this
section.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before Council provided that such person shall file,
within ten calendar days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed and dated by the applicant,
and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to
Council.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, Council shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal not to exceed 60 calendar days from the date of
receipt of the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and
decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. Council shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
Council.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   A fee as stipulated by ordinance shall be paid by the applicant
payable to the General Fund.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Council shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 calendar days after the receipt of an application for
a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least 30 calendar days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as Council requires. In considering such variance
applications, Council shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations, and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant,
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws,
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages, and
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (d)(3)A. through K. of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of Council, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   Council shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The decision of Council may be announced at the conclusion of the
hearing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable time after
the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of Council may
appeal such decision to the Franklin County or Pickaway County, as applicable,
Court of Common Pleas, as provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.

as to warrant individual consideration and regulation due to unique demands
placed upon the public health, safety and general welfare and the requirements
of location and development that generally are peculiar to these uses.
   (b)   The Exceptional Use District (EU) is intended to allow these uses to
be suitably located and developed to appropriate and necessary standards of
development in relation to other land uses and development with a minimum of
conflict, without undue demand on necessary public services and facilities, and
without adverse impact on the natural environment. To this end, these uses are
intended to be developed in a manner of appropriate architectural, engineering,
and landscape design and layout with necessary space or other provisions
regarding development or operation to overcome any obnoxious or hazardous
effect on adjacent lands as such effect may be a potential in the proposed use.
   (c)   The Exceptional Use District (EU) is a holding district for recently
annexed land into the Village of Commercial Point until a development plan is
submitted. Any change to the current use of the annexed property is required to
go through the rezoning process of
Chapter 1143.

   The purpose of these provisions is to allow where appropriate limited, non-
residential activities in residential structures that are compatible with the
neighborhoods in which such structures and related home occupation activities
are located. The standards provided for herein are intended to ensure
compatibility of home occupations with other permitted uses and with the

creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical interference
detectable to the normal senses off the lot. In the case of electrical
interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or
audible interference in any radio or televisions receivers off the premises, or
causes fluctuations in line voltage off the premises.
      (5)   There shall only be limited sales on the premises of goods produced
on the premises.

volume than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any
need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall meet
the off-street parking requirements as to use as specified under Chapter 1185,
and shall not be located in front of the building line.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1187.03 CONDITIONAL USE.
   It is recognized that there may exist certain home occupations that fail to
meet the criteria of §

following additional criteria are met through the conditional use procedure of
Chapter 1145 including the requirements therein.
   (a)   Requirements. Home occupation conditional uses shall be limited by the
following criteria and/or any other conditions as determined by Council in

structure accessory to the principal structure.
      (3)   Sales of commodities not produced on the premises may be permitted
provided such commodities are specified and approved as a part of the
application for a conditional use, provided Council determines that such sales
will not become a detriment to the existing residential character of the lot or
neighborhood through a resulting increase in traffic, noise, vibration, glare,
fumes, odors or electrical interference or any other factor resulting in an
adverse impact.
      (4)   Organized instruction may be permitted provided the class size does
not exceed six pupils during any one period of instruction, provided Council
determines that such organized instruction will not become a detriment to the
existing residential character of the lot or neighborhood through a resulting
increase in traffic, on-street parking, or any other factor resulting in an
adverse impact.
      (5)   No outside storage of any kind associated with a home occupation
conditional use shall be permitted unless it is totally screened from the
adjacent residential lots and the abutting street(s).
      (6)   The off-street parking requirements of
Chapter 1185 apply and such off- street parking area shall not be located in
front of the building line.
   (b)   Validity. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, a home occupation
conditional use ceases to be valid once the premises used for the home
occupation is no longer occupied by the holder of the certificate of zoning
compliance or upon the conduct of a home occupation in a manner not approved by
Council.

required information has been provided. At the request of the applicant or the
municipality, an administrative review meeting may be held to review the
request in light of the purpose and the review standards of this section. A
field inspection of the site may be conducted by the Zoning Administrator.
Where the site proposed for development requires review or approval by Council
of the subdivision layout, qualification for one-family cluster, or special
land use approval, Council shall be responsible for approval or denial of the
request for a tree removal permit (subject to affirmance, reversal or
modification by the Council of Commercial Point with respect to tentative
preliminary plat approval, or any other approval for which Council has final
authority). In all other instances, the review of tree removal permit requests
shall be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator. All decisions shall be
made in accordance with the review standards of this section.
      (2)   Denial. If an application for a tree removal permit is denied, the
permit applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for denial by the

operations.
         C.   Require a permit holder to deposit a performance bond, or other
acceptable security, equal to 100% of the cost of the improvements to ensure
compliance with the terms of this section, including the planting of any
required replacement trees. Once the trees designated to be removed have been
removed and any required replacement trees have been planted and inspected, the
municipality shall release the bond or security. If the permit holder has
provided a bond or other performance guarantee to the municipality under any
other ordinance or regulation, and such bond or guarantee is deemed adequate by
the municipality to ensure compliance with this section, no additional
performance guarantee shall be required under this section.
   (e)   Term of Permit.
      (1)   Any and all tree removal permits issued by the municipality to a
developer shall expire (unless extended) at the same time as the
contemporaneous approval granted by the municipality for the development, if
any (e.g., preliminary plat, preliminary site plan, special land use, site plan
approval, etc.).
      (2)   Any and all tree removal permits issued by the municipality to any
person for an activity regulated under this section for which a contemporaneous
approval of the development is not required (e.g., removal of trees by a
builder in connection with construction of a residence upon a lot or parcel)
shall expire one year from the date of issuance.
      (3)   Any activity regulated under this section which is to be commenced
after expiration of a tree removal permit shall require a new application,
additional fees, and new review and approval.
   (f)   Protection of Trees and Woodlands during Construction; Display of
Permit.
      (1)   No individual shall conduct any activity within ten feet of the
drip line of any tree designated to remain, including but not limited to
placing solvents, building material, construction equipment, or soil deposits
within the drip line.
      (2)   During construction, no individual shall attach a device or wire to
any remaining tree, except to cordon off protected areas.
      (3)   Before development, land clearing, filling, or any property
alteration for which a tree removal permit is required, the developer or
builder shall erect and maintain suitable barriers such as snow fencing,
cyclone fencing, etc., to protect remaining trees. Wood, metal, or other
substantial material shall be utilized in the construction of barriers.
Protective barriers shall remain in place until the Zoning Administrator
authorizes their removal. Barriers are required for all trees designated to
remain, except in the following cases:
         A.   Street right-of-way and utility easement may be cordoned by
placing stakes a minimum of 25 feet apart and tying ribbon, plastic tape, or
other brightly visible materials at least two and one-half feet above the
ground from stake to stake along the outside perimeters of areas to be cleared.
         B.   Large property areas separate from the construction or land
clearing area onto which no equipment will venture shall be cordoned off.
      (4)   The permit holder shall conspicuously display the tree removal
permit on-site. The permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are
being removed or while activities authorized under the permit are performed,
and for ten days following completion of those activities. The permit holder
shall allow the Zoning Administrator to enter and inspect the premises during
reasonable business hours. Failure to allow an inspection is a violation of
this section.
   (g)   Enforcement and Administration. To ensure enforcement of this section
and the approved plan for tree removal, various inspections will be performed
at the site by the Zoning Administrator. The applicant will be responsible for
all inspection fees in accordance with the inspection fees set and established
by ordinance of the Council.
   (h)   Penalties and Remedies.
      (1)   In addition to the penalties as set forth in §
1135.12, any person who violates any provision of this section shall forfeit
and pay a civil penalty equal to the total value of those trees illegally
removed or damaged, as computed from the International Society of Arboriculture
shade tree value formula. Such sum shall accrue to the municipality and may be
recovered in a civil action brought by the municipality.
      (2)   Any person authorized or designated by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator to enforce or administer this section may issue a stop work order
to any person conducting any operation in violation of this section. A person
shall not continue, or cause or allow to be continued, any operation in
violation of such an order, except as authorized by the enforcing agency to
abate a dangerous condition or remove the violation.
      (3)   If a stop work order is not obeyed, the enforcing agency or person
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for any order enjoining the
violation of the order. This remedy is in addition to, and not in limitation
of, any other remedy provided by law or ordinance, and does not prevent
criminal prosecution for failure to obey the order.
      (4)   Any person aggrieved by a stop work order may request review by the
Zoning Administrator of the stop work order within one working day of its
issuance. The Zoning Administrator shall then determine whether the stop work
order was properly issued due to operations being conducted in violation of the
terms of this section. The Zoning Administrator may lift the stop work order if
the operations are determined to be in compliance with this section.
      (5)   Any use or activity in violation of the terms of this section is
hereby declared to be a nuisance per se, and may be abated by order of any
court of competent jurisdiction. In addition to other remedies, the
municipality may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent,
abate, or restrain the violation. All costs, fees and expenses in connection
with such action, including attorney fees incurred by the municipality, shall
be assessed against the violator.

      (3)   No person or contractor, unless working on behalf of the
municipality, shall attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising poster,
decoration, decorative lighting, or other contrivance to any tree on
municipally owned property. No person shall permit any fire to burn where such
fire or heat therefrom, or heat from any source will injure any portion of any

applicable regulations;
      (7)   Register with all appropriate underground reporting services; and

   (b)   Construction and Technical Standards.
      (1)   Upon grant of the permit and in order to construct, operate and
maintain a telecommunications system or utility in the municipality, the

any permit.
      (5)   Any contractor proposed for work of construction, installation,
operation, maintenance, and repair of system equipment must be properly
licensed under laws of the state, and all local ordinances. The contractor's or
permittee's system and associated equipment erected by the contractor or
permittee within the municipality shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and
places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of said streets, alleys or other
public ways and places. No pole or other fixtures placed in any public ways by
the contractor or permittee shall be placed in such a manner as to interfere
with normal travel on such public way.

bond (or self-bonding by permittee having capitalization in excess of five
million dollars ($5,000,000) as determined by the Mayor), an irrevocable letter
of credit acceptable to the municipality or a certified check in an amount
determined by the Mayor to pay the cost of restoration of the right-of-way
should the permittee fail to perform restoration required by this chapter or
the permit or to pay the cost of removal or relocation of the system required
by this chapter should the permittee fail to perform said removal or
relocation.
   (c)   Right-of-Way Work Permit Required. All permittees shall obtain a
right-of-way work permit from the Planning and Zoning Administrator prior to
beginning the erection, installation or maintenance including tree trimming, of
any lines or equipment. Prior municipal approval shall not be required for
emergency repairs, routine maintenance and repairs, operation which do not
require excavation in the public right-of-way, blockage of any street or alley

to the Commercial Development Standards. Any standards specifically stated in
an adopted zoning text shall supersede the related standard found in the
Commercial Development Standards.
   (b)   Properties located within the Old Town Overlay shall not be required
to meet the Commercial Development Standards.
   (c)   New additions or accessory structures that have a square footage of
less than 50% of the existing buildings square footage shall only be required
to meet § 1199.03 (Building Design) of these Commercial Development Standards.
If an addition or accessory structure is 50% or larger than the existing
building, the entire building and site shall be subject to all Commercial
Development Standards.
   (d)   All newly constructed parking areas shall meet the requirements of the
Commercial Development Standards.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.03 BUILDING DESIGN.
   Buildings shall be designed to be seen from 360 degrees and have the same
caliber of finish on all elevations. Building additions and accessory
structures, whether attached or detached, shall be of similar design,
materials, and construction to that of the existing or principal structure.
   (a)   Architectural Features. The purpose of requiring four-sided
architecture is to avoid large areas of blank exterior. For every 100 feet of
elevation width, each side and rear elevation must contain at least two design
elements and each front elevation must contain at least three design elements.
For multi-story buildings, each story on a single elevation shall contain at
least two design elements. Typical design elements are as follows:
      (1)   A door of at least 28 square feet in area with an awning, window,
faux window or other feature subject to approval by Council.
      (2)   A window of at least six square feet in area. Windows closer than
ten feet shall be considered as one element. A set of adjacent windows, such as
double or bay windows, shall be considered as one element.
      (3)   A chimney.
      (4)   An articulated gable vent of at least four square feet in area.
      (5)   Porches, decks or similar structures.
      (6)   A similar significant permanent architectural feature consistent
with the style of the building upon approval by Council.
   (b)   Articulation. A building frontage that exceeds a width of 50 feet
shall incorporate articulation and offset of the wall plane to inhibit a large
expanse of blank wall and add interest to the facade.
   (c)   Materials. All exterior walls shall be comprised of 80% natural
material with brick or stone as the predominant material. Other natural
materials may also be incorporated into the building's exterior design. Use of
"newer" materials is subject to approval by Council. Stucco, drivit and like
materials may be used as accents provided the total square footage of accent
material does not exceed 20% of the gross exterior building wall square
footage.
   (d)   Glass. Elevations facing the primary street shall be a minimum of 40%
glass between the height of two feet and ten feet and have an unobstructed view
of the building interior to a depth of four feet. The use of black, gold,
green, silver, or any other reflective colored glass on a building is
prohibited. The use of spandrel glass is also prohibited. Frosted glass may be
permitted in some cases, subject to approval of Council.
   (e)   Building Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented to face the primary
street right-of-way. An entryway shall be located on the front of the building.
Corner entrances are acceptable to meet this requirement if one side of the
corner entrance faces the primary street right-of-way.
   (f)   Roofing. All pitched roofs shall be of dimensional shingles, standing
seam metal, slate, or simulated slate.
   (g)   Mechanical Equipment. All external and rooftop mechanical equipment,
including satellite antennas, and trash dumpsters shall be screened from view
at all property lines on which the building is located. Screening materials
shall be complimentary to those used on the majority of the building. For
ground mounted equipment, landscaping is the preferred method of screening. If
two or more buildings are located on the same property, rooftop equipment shall
not be visible at ground level within 50 feet from any building.
   (h)   Drive Thru Features. A drive thru, if deemed appropriate for the site
by Council via a conditional use of the applicable zoning district, shall be
designed as an integral part of the structure it serves. Features incorporated
with a drive through, including, but not limited to canopies, awnings and
support posts, shall match the materials and color scheme of the building they
are serving. Drive thru features shall not have any pick-up windows, ordering
areas, signage, or other related items located on the front elevation of a
building or located between the front of the building and a street right-of-
way.
   (i)   In-Line Retail Exemption. Side or rear elevations of in-line retail
developments may be exempt from the building design standards of this section
if such elevations are not visible to customer traffic, a public right-of-way
or if a future phase of the inline retail development is forthcoming adjacent
to the elevation. Such exempt elevations shall use materials complimentary to
the primary elevation and be screened by landscaping, mounding, fencing, or a
combination thereof, as outlined in division (f) of this section, and as deemed
appropriate by Council.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.04 SITE DESIGN.
   (a)   Build-To Line. To promote quality streets, buildings shall meet build-
to lines along public roadway frontages. Build-to lines shall be 50 feet from
the right-of-way on major arterials as designated on the Commercial Point
Transportation Thoroughfare Plan and 25 feet from the right-of-way on all other
streets.
      (1)   In order to achieve quality streetscapes, variation from the build-
to line will be permitted to allow for added green space, amenities, outdoor
seating and the like. Buildings may be located further from the right-of-way
than the established build-to line per the following:
 
Building Height      Variation from Build-To Line
One Story Building   0 feet to 5 feet
Two Story Building   0 feet to 10 feet
Three Story Building 0 feet to 15 feet
 
      (2)   At least 50% of the building's front elevation shall be located
within the applicable variation from the build-to line range.
      (3)   Uncovered seating areas or architectural features may project up to
five feet closer to the right-of-way than the established build-to line.
      (4)   Buildings larger than 20,000 square feet or attached to existing
in-line retail space shall be exempt from the build to line requirements if
located more than 300 feet from the right-of-way.
   (b)   Sidewalks and Multi-Purpose Paths. A sidewalk, or multi-purpose path
as designated in the Commercial Point Comprehensive Plan, shall be constructed
along all public streets. In addition, a sidewalk shall connect the building
entrance with the sidewalk or multi-purpose path along the primary public
street.
   (c)   Adjacent Pavement. Pavement is prohibited directly adjacent to any
building elevation, except for loading zone areas, vehicular building
entrances, drive thru windows, or at entrance walk ways into the building.
   (d)   Trash Containers, Service Areas and Loading Zones. Trash containers,
service areas and loading zones shall be located at the rear of the building.
Trash containers, service areas and loading zones may be permitted on the side
of a building if not oriented towards a public or private street and properly
screened from public or private streets and residential zoning districts.
   (e)   Utility Boxes. Utility boxes shall be located to the rear of the
building and painted the same, or primary, color of the building elevation
where the utility box is located.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.05 PARKING LOT DESIGN.
   Parking lot areas shall be designed to reduce their visual impact,
production of excess heat and effect on drainage. Appropriately sized
landscaped areas shall be provided within each parking lot area allowing for a
variety of shade trees to be planted that will not buckle the parking lot's
surface and at the same time provide shade. Therefore, all off-street parking
lot areas shall be designed using the "parking bay" concept, which consists of
parking spaces grouped together and each parking bay separated by landscaped
tree islands.
   (a)   Parking Lot Location. All parking spaces, drives or other structures
for vehicular parking or movement shall be located to the rear or side of the
principal building with no more than 50% of such parking area located to the
side of the principal building.
      (1)   Buildings larger than 20,000 square feet or attached to existing
in-line retail space shall be permitted to have parking to the front of the
building if the building is located more than 300 feet from the right-of-way
and the parking lot is located no closer than 200 feet from the right-of-way.
      (2)   If a drive thru is deemed appropriate by Council and designed per §
1199.03(h) of this Zoning Code, a drive lane may be permitted to be located in
front of the building. In such case, the building shall be moved the furthest
away from the build-to line as indicated in §
1199.04(a)(1) of the Commercial Development Standards.
   (b)   Parking Bays. No parking bay shall contain more than 24 total parking
spaces, with a maximum of 12 spaces in a single row.
   (c)   Maximum Number of Parking Spaces. Off street parking areas shall only
be permitted to have 25% more spaces than stated as the applicable minimum in §
1185.03.
      (1)   Parking spaces above the maximum shall be permitted with an
additional 60 square feet of landscaping provided for every one additional
parking space. The provided additional landscaping shall be in addition to the
minimum landscaping required in §
1191.02(c)(2).
      (2)   Additional landscaping shall include a mix of trees and shrubs and
be clearly identified as additional landscaping on the site's landscaping plan.
   (d)   Parking Lot Islands. Each landscaped tree island in a single loaded
parking stall design shall have a minimum area of 162 square feet with a
minimum width of nine feet. Each landscaped island located in a double loaded
parking stall design shall have a minimum area of 324 square feet, with a
minimum width of nine feet. The landscaped tree island(s) shall contain at
least one shade tree and include at least 50 square feet of other plant
materials.
   (e)   Bio-swales. Bio-swales, also referred to as rain gardens, may be
incorporated in the overall parking lot design. In addition to separating
parking bays, when properly designed bio-swales/rain gardens can also assist
with stormwater quality and quantity management.
   (f)   Intersection Site Distance. When a drive isle intersects with an
internal service road, nothing shall materially impede the vision between a
height of two and one-half feet and ten feet for the area bounded by the
intersecting street lines of those roadways and a line joining points along
said roadways 15 feet from the point of intersection.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.06 SITE LIGHTING.
   Site lighting shall be required for all developments and be designed to
sufficiently illuminate the site and minimize spillover off of the property.
   (a)   Design. All external lighting shall be decorative or historic in
design. Typical "shoe box" light fixtures are not acceptable. Pack light, wall
pack lights and similar lights that primarily shine perpendicular to (away
from) a building's elevation are not permitted on any building elevation.
Decorative wall lights that shine parallel to (up or down) a building's
elevation are subject to approval by Council.
   (b)   Lighting Intensity. Foot candles measure the intensity of light. One
foot candle is equal to the amount of light generated by one candle shining on
a square foot surface one foot away. All parking lot areas shall have lighting
intensity meeting the following standards as measured at grade:
 
Maximum Intensity 20 Foot Candles
Average Intensity 1 to 3 Foot Candles
 
   (c)   Light Spillage. All outdoor lighting shall be directed, reflected or
shielded so as not to be of excessive brightness or cause glare hazardous to
pedestrians or drivers, create a nuisance or unreasonably interfere with a
neighboring property owner's right to enjoy his property. Light spillage shall
not exceed one tenth foot candles when adjacent to a residential district or
existing residential use.
   (d)   Light Pole Height. Pole heights should be in harmony with the parcel,
building and parking lot size as well as the surrounding area. Smaller parcels
in a more dense condition pole height should be limited in height to respond to
the smaller parcels and more human scale of the site. In large commercial
centers with large building footprints, parcels and parking lots, the pole
heights can be higher to reduce the number of poles needed to adequately light
the site. Parking lots with 30 or less spaces shall have a maximum lighting
pole height of 18 feet. Parking lots with more than 30 spaces shall have a
maximum lighting pole height of 30 feet.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.07 SIGNAGE.
   (a)   Monument Signs. All freestanding signs shall be monument-type, have a
base consistent with the primary building material and have a minimum of 50
square feet of year-round landscaping around all sides of the monument sign.
   (b)   Multi-Tenant Buildings. For multi-tenant buildings, signs for first
floor tenants shall not extend above the window sill of the second story unless
the tenant is located on the second floor.
   (c)   Prohibited Signs. Cabinet box, exposed neon, exposed LED, changeable
copy (manual or electronic), roof-mounted, monopole, rotating, signs with
flashing messages or bare bulbs, signs on backlit awnings, off-premise signs,
billboards, and bench signs are not permitted.
(Ord. 2020-10, passed 6-15-2020)
§ 1199.08 STORM WATER DETENTION.
   (a)   Detention Basins. Dry detention basins are prohibited. All detention
basins shall be wet basins and may require aeration devices in their design.
The requirement of aeration devices and their installation detail shall be
determined and approved by the Technical Review Group.
   (b)   Bio-retention Basins. Bio-retention basins, also known as rain
gardens, may be used only when approved by the municipality.
   (c)   Maintenance of Detention Basins. The maintenance of detention basins
shall be the responsibility of the property owner or property owners’
association, as applicable, and not the Village of Commercial Point. Such
maintenance shall ensure that water in each detention basin or flowing through
the detention basin outlet does not restrict the flow of the public storm sewer
system.

§ 1444.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. This chapter adopts
regulations for areas of special flood hazard that are necessary for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   Commercial Point has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters, or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the village as identified in §
1444.06, including any additional areas of special special flood hazard annexed
by the village.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Pickaway County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Pickaway County, Ohio and incorporated Areas both
effective July 22, 2010.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard include: USDA,
Pickaway County Soil Survey, issued February 1980, and any revisions thereto.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the state that has been approved by
Pickaway County as required by §
1444.27, Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments. Any revisions to the
aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations. The maps and/or studies are on file at the
Office of Development and Planning, 124 West Franklin St. Circleville, OH
43113.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations do not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-03, passed 7-21-2010)
§ 1444.11 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   ZONE AH.  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure below the
lowest floor which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that the enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. For the purposes of
these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code § 3701-
27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Commercial Point Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated September 30, 1999, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C. 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. Agency does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 through
4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 1444.33 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
1444.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives that would not result in increased
base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section 1444.33(a)(2), items A. and C. through E.
   (c)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator
may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the village
specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it
shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
1444.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 1444.37 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by Pickaway County.
   (b)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
the hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Public hearing. At the hearing the applicant shall present statements
and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering the variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (6)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in (c)(1) through (11) of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
