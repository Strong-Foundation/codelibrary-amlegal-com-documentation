EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)

taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

105.04 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM.
   It is the policy of the City to adopt an Affirmative Action Program, which
Council may from time to time see fit to vary according to the needs of that
time, a copy of which is included as follows:
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM
   The City of Zanesville wishes to promulgate an Affirmative Action Program
for the improvement of conditions for all people living within the City.
Insofar as it is able to enforce such a program, the City will use all efforts
of conciliation and recommendation to assist all of its residents in obtaining
the goals of equal opportunity. These goals were first enunciated in the most
basic doctrine of our Republic, the Declaration of Independence, which declared
, "All men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator with certain
inalienable rights and among these rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness." From these noble ideals we proclaim that action must be taken to
insure all people the right to that pursuit of happiness regardless of their
race or national origin over which they have no control or their fundamental
beliefs which should not be an impediment to their economic abilities.
 
   To achieve equal employment opportunities goals have been suggested by
governmental units, Federal and State, and the City of Zanesville wishes to
express its program. It is the policy of this City in its own employment and in
its contractural agreements that all people shall have an equal employment
opportunity at least equal to that of their percentage of the population. The
population of the City of Zanesville in accordance with the current census
bureau figures discloses a percentage of approximately 9% minorities. It is
therefore declared to be the goal in employment opportunities of the City of
Zanesville both with itself and in contracts with others that a 9 - 11%
minority be employed or an affirmative action program be implemented.
   If the occasion should arise that qualified minority employees are not
available in these percentages, than it is the established goal to find
unemployed or underemployed minorities residing within the community and when
practical training programs should be initiated to provide better opportunities
for better employees and the improvement of the community. It appears that this
program shall be capable of achievement in 4 - 6 years.
   It is the purpose of this City to review the program from time to time to
see what, if any, changes will be necessary.
(Ord. 73-21. Passed 2-26-73.)

(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.11 COUNCIL COMMITTEE-AS-A-WHOLE.
   Should a majority of a Committee feel that the matter placed in their
Committee warrants study by Council as a Committee-As-A-Whole, a request signed
by the majority of such Committee shall be read by the Clerk of Council. The

Committee-As-A-Whole, and shall serve as chairman of this Committee. The
President of Council may decide to send any matter to Committee-As- A-Whole.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.12 SECURING RECOGNITION.
   Any Council member desiring to speak before Council must secure recognition
from the President before speaking. Members must confine themselves to one
subject at a time or to the matter under discussion. All Council members must
avoid bringing personalities into their discussion and remain professional,
courteous, respectful, and polite, and not be overly loud or boisterous. The
President's call to order must be obeyed.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.13 ADDRESSING COUNCIL.
   Members of the public should understand that Council meetings are not public
forums. These meetings are held to conduct City business and certain portions
of the meetings may be deemed to be limited public forums. In a limited public
forum, Council has the right to impose reasonable content-based restrictions as
long as the restrictions remain viewpoint neutral. Council can impose
reasonable time, place and manner restrictions to ensure the efficient
administration of municipal business. Courts have upheld rules that limit
public content to the agenda item at hand do not violate the First Amendment
and that speakers can be cut off for being repetitious or irrelevant as long as
they are not targeted because officials disagree with their views. With that in
mind, Council wants to ensure that citizens have a right to express any views
that are relevant to the affairs of the jurisdiction while working to ensure
the efficient administration of City business.
   (a)    Zanesville City Council welcomes, values, and appreciates the varied
opinions and comments from members of the public. However, to ensure that the
meetings are respectful, peaceful, and orderly, it is necessary to establish
rules to prevent disruption and allow City business to be accomplished in an
efficient and productive manner. Members of the public will be permitted to
address Council for the purpose of commenting on legislation being considered
by Council and/or for the purpose of commenting regarding City actions or
services that the speaker believes should or should not be taken by Council or
issues that should be addressed by Council or the Administration.
   (b)    Addressing Council shall not be utilized for the following purposes:
      (1)   To debate or make personal or critical attacks against members of
the public or businesses.
      (2)   To speak in support or opposition of candidates for public office
or to announce that a speaker is a candidate for public office.
   (c)    Those desiring to address Council must complete a "Petition to
Address Council." These Petitions are available in the Clerk's office, online,
by email request, and in Council Chambers. To speak on a non-agenda item, the
completed Petition must be provided to the Clerk of Council by noon on
Wednesday the week prior to the Council meeting to be eligible to speak at the
meeting. To address Council on an item that is on the agenda, the Petition must
be provided to the Clerk of Council fifteen minutes prior to beginning of the
meeting. Council will not consider an incomplete Petition to Address Council,
which requires the following: Name, Organization Representing (if any),
Address, Telephone Number, Email Address (optional), Ordinance/Resolution
Number and if For or Against the legislation, and if not speaking on an agenda
item list the Subject. Also required is a Signature and Date to indicate "I
Have read the restrictions and guidelines regarding speaking before Council,
including those set forth in Chapter
111 of Zanesville's Codified Ordinances. I understand and agree to abide by
these rules and acknowledge that my failure to abide by these rules may result
in my request to speak being denied or terminated". It is recommended that any
available supporting documentation be submitted with the Petition to ensure
that Council and City Administration have the information necessary to
effectively respond to the concern. All documents submitted to Council become
public documents, so please ensure that all personal and private information is
redacted (deleted or removed).
      It is strongly recommended, but not required, that prior to submitting a
Petition, the citizen contact their Council Representative (or any Council
Representative) to discuss and possibly resolve the Citizen's concern. This
would also provide an opportunity for the Council Representative to act as an
advocate for the Citizen if warranted. The Clerk of Council may be contacted
for assistance in identifying and contacting a Council Representative or
Representatives, providing information to address City Council and for
potential issue resolution prior to coming to Council.
   (d)    Remarks are Limited to 3 minutes unless additional time is granted by
Council (which shall be granted in 3 minute increments). To extend a speakers
time, a member of Council shall make a motion to waive this rule and extend the
speakers time by 3 minutes, followed by a second of the motion, and a majority
vote in favor by Council. This time limit shall not apply to Special Guests,
Subject Experts, City Employees, Elected Officials and City Administration who
are invited to provide information, reports, or testimony to Council and they
are not required to fill out a Petition to Address Council. Numerous courts
have upheld ejections from Council meetings based on speakers going off topic,
being unduly repetitive, yelling, or refusing to stop speaking after their
allowed time expired. The 3 minute time limit will be strictly enforced.
   (e)    Speaking before Council is limited to only once for each
Communication, Resolution or Ordinance, and only once for a Private Petition/
non-Agenda item per Council meeting. A completed petition is required for each
request.
   (f)    All comments must be directed to the President or Council as a body.
   (g)    The following General Rules of Decorum shall apply to all individuals
addressing Council:
      (1)   Individuals desiring to address Council shall wait to be recognized
by the President. After having been recognized, he or she shall approach the
podium, state his or her name and address and then proceed to address Council
as a whole and not any individual.
      (2)   All comments will be made in a courteous and respectful manner by
all parties and not in an overly loud or boisterous manner.
      (3)   No person who addresses Council shall make personal, impolite,
repetitive, disrespectful, hostile, disparaging, slanderous, offensive,
threatening, obscene, or profane remarks. Speakers shall not conduct themselves
in a manner that disrupts or impedes the orderly conduct of the meeting or
otherwise constitutes disorderly conduct. "Disruption" has been held to include
any conduct that violates generally or specially established rules such that
the orderly conduct of the meeting is harmed. The following example has been
held to being disruptive - "speaking too long, by being repetitious, or by
extending discussion of irrelevancies."
      (4)   All comments made by the public shall be made from the speaker's
podium. No comments shall be made from any other location (other than members
of Council and the Administration), and anyone making "out of order' comments
may be subject to removal.
      (5)   The President shall have the sole discretion to determine whether
or not a speaker's conduct is violating these Rules of Decorum. If in the
President's discretion the rules are being violated, the President may take any
action necessary to preserve the due conduct of the meeting, including but not
limited to: (1) verbal warnings; (2) denial or termination of speaking
privileges; (3) removal from the meeting; (4) banning an individual from
speaking at future Council and Committee meetings; and (5) request for law
enforcement to remove or arrest the individual (ORC 2917.12). These possible
sanctions by the President need not be progressive in nature.
   (h)    No repetition of remarks shall be permitted nor speaking on the same
subject matter will be allowed at more than three meetings, unless there has
been a substantive change to the legislation or situation as determined by the
President.
   (i)    To accommodate special needs or circumstances that are in the best
interest of the City, Council may temporarily suspend any of these rules, by
motion, second and 2/3 majority vote (6 votes), which includes the opportunity
to address Council without written notice.
   (j)   If a speaker does not speak on a matter concerning the legislative or
administrative responsibilities of City government, the President may terminate
the right to speak and refer the speaker to more appropriate public forum.
   (k)    Signs and banners are not permitted in Council Chambers. This
prohibition does not apply to charts, diagrams, enlarged photographs, or other
demonstrative exhibits or visual media utilized by a speaker in presenting
testimony to Council.
   (l)   Any variance or waiver of these rules shall be by a 2/3 majority vote
(6 votes) of Council.
      (Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.14 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   All minutes, legislation, reports and records of committees shall be
preserved among the records of Council. No original record book, paper or
official document shall be removed from Council Office without the written
consent and justification by the President of Council. The Clerk of Council
shall obtain copies of official identification and a receipt whenever any of
the above items are taken from the office.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.15 PRESENTATION OF BUSINESS.
   All business presented at Council session, requiring an ordinance or
resolution, shall be presented in legal form, to the Clerk of Council. No
legislation shall be presented in the same form more than one time in a six
month period.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.16 DEADLINE FOR AGENDA.
   All legislation and business requiring final action by Council must be
presented to the Clerk of Council by 12:00 noon Wednesday preceding the
regularly scheduled Council meeting. The Clerk of Council shall prepare an
agenda subject to the approval of the President of Council, for the regular
Council meeting to be held the following Monday night. The Clerk shall then
forward a copy of the agenda to each Council member, the Mayor, and local news
media as requested. In the event that business of an emergency nature should be
brought to the attention of the President of Council, he may place it on the
agenda, by notifying each Council member of the subject and reason for the
emergency action. Such notification should be at least one-half hour before the
meeting in question; or the President of Council may present it during the
Council meeting and ask for a motion to add an item to the agenda.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)
111.17 MAKING AND POSTPONING A MOTION.
   Prior to making a motion, the Council member must first be recognized by the
President to speak. Motions must be clear and be duly seconded, before it is
open to discussion and vote. Whenever a motion to postpone is presented to
Council, and the motion does not specify a definite date to reconsider, it is
the rule of Council that it must be brought up for reconsideration at the next
meeting. The only exception to this rule shall apply to postponing a motion to
send to Committee for study, and the matter will be reconsidered at the meeting
following completion of Committee study.
(Ord. 15-44. Passed 8-24-15.)

147.01 NECESSITY.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City, slum,
blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this
chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious and inimicable
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents
thereof; that the existence of such areas:
   (a)   Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection and for other public services and
facilities;
   (b)   Constitutes an economic and social liability, and
   (c)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community;
retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems
and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the
improvement of traffic facilities.
   It is also found and determined that this menace is beyond remedy and
control solely by regulatory processes and exercise of the police power and
cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operation of private
enterprise without the aids herein provided; that the elimination in whole or
in part of slum, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas and the
prevention of occurrence or recurrence of such areas by redevelopment and by
the conservation, rehabilitation and reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of
the salvageable portions of such areas and by other activities pursuant to
urban redevelopment or urban renewal as defined herein, are public uses and
purposes for which public money may be expended and private property acquired
by purchase, by donation and by eminent domain and are governmental functions
of concern to the City and require the exercise of the powers of government
granted to the City by the provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution
and that the necessity in the public interest and general welfare, for the
provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative
determination.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.02 COUNCIL POLICY.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of Council to promote and encourage
the sound development, including renewal and redevelopment where necessary, of
the entire City in accordance with the general plan for the City. Council
realizes that the City government will be unable to carry out coordinated and
effective programs for renewing the City without the cooperation and support of
the public as a whole. Therefore, Council stands ready to cooperate with
private enterprise, civic groups, neighborhood agencies and governmental
agencies in developing and carrying out urban renewal programs and projects to
promote the sound development of new areas, to prevent the spread of slums and
blight and to eliminate slums, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas
in the City.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in this section unless a different meaning is clearly
indicated in the context.
   (a)   "Agency", "urban renewal agency", "local public agency" or "City"
means the City of Zanesville, Ohio.
   (b)   "Slum, blighted or deteriorated area" means an area within the
corporate limits of the City in which there are a majority of structures or

open spaces, high density of population and overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary
conditions or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by
fire or other hazards and causes, or any combination of such factors, and an
area with overcrowding or improper location of structures on the land,
excessive dwelling unit density, detrimental land uses or conditions, unsafe,
congested, poorly designed streets or inadequate public facilities or
utilities, all of which substantially impair the sound growth and planning of
the community, are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant
mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime and are detrimental to the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (c)   "Deteriorating area" means either:
      (1)   An area, whether predominantly built up or open, which is not a
slum, blighted or deteriorated area but which, because of incompatible land
uses, nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking facilities, faulty street
arrangement, obsolete platting, inadequate community and public utilities,
diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, increased density of population
without commensurate increases in new residential buildings and community
facilities, high turnover in residential or commercial occupancy, lack of
maintenance and repair of buildings, or any combination thereof, is detrimental
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and which will
deteriorate or is in danger of deteriorating into a slum, blighted or
deteriorated area; or
      (2)   An area consisting principally of land in highways, railway or
subway tracks, bridge or tunnel entrances or other similar facilities which

areas, together with any adjoining areas having specially related problems, of
such scope that urban renewal activities in the urban renewal area or areas may
have to be initiated in more than one separate urban renewal project, over an

projects, including all planning and other related activities of the City in
connection therewith, or any part of such activities.
   (g)   "Open space land" means land which has not been developed by the
construction or installation of streets, utilities, buildings (except sporadic
or incidental structures) or other site improvements. Whether or not such an
area has been platted in whole or in part does not prevent its classification
as "open space land".

entering into a conforming agreement with the City in consideration of being
permitted by the City to retain title to such property.

record of proceedings of the Planning Commission.
 
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval or recommendations concerning such plan. The approval of the
Commission shall also constitute its approval of those matters placed under its
jurisdiction by Ohio R.C. 713.02, except as the recommendations of the Planning
Commission may include a disapproval pursuant to such section. Except as
recommendations or disapprovals are received from the Planning Commission on or
before the thirtieth day after the day of delivery to the person charged with

(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.08 PUBLIC HEARING; COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)   Council, before approving a general neighborhood renewal plan or an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, shall hold a public hearing on the
plan at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons interested to be
heard either in person or by counsel, which hearings may be adjourned from time
to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing will be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for two
consecutive weeks on the same day of the week, and at least seven full days
shall elapse between the second publication and the date set for the public
hearing. Such notice shall also contain a description of the project area by
its location in relation to highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or
artificial boundaries, and shall also designate the place at which the plan,
maps, plats and other materials describing the project area are and will be
available for public inspection.
 
   (b)   Following the completion of such public hearing, Council may either
approve or reject the general neighborhood renewal plan or the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan, or make modifications and approve such plan as
modified; provided that:
      (1)   If the boundaries of the project area are extended to include any
land (except land contained within the right-of-way lines of a dedicated street
or alley) not included in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon
which the public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, or if
there is added a type of urban renewal or redevelopment activity not included
in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the public hearing
was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof which required the acquisition of
property, or if there is any change in land use or redevelopment restrictions
contained in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon which the
public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, a public hearing
shall be held on such urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan as modified
prior to the approval thereof by City Council in accordance with the provisions
of subsection (a) hereof; and
      (2)   If such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission,
such general neighborhood renewal plan or urban renewal plan or urban
redevelopment plan as modified shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission
for its written approval or recommendations pursuant to the provisions of
Section
147.07.
 
   (c)   When Council wishes to approve a general neighborhood renewal plan or
an urban renewal or redevelopment plan, it shall do so by ordinance, passed by
a majority vote; provided, however, if such plan has not been approved by the
Planning Commission, or if there were any partial disapprovals by or adverse
recommendations of the Planning Commission under Ohio R.C. 713.02, not accepted
by Council by its modifications of the plan in accordance therewith, then an
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of Council shall be required to
pass such ordinance and, to the extent that such disapproval involves the
construction of an improvement or utility within the meaning of Ohio R.C.
713.02, the concurrence of the head of the department or departments having
control of the construction of such proposed improvement or utility shall also
be necessary.
   (d)   The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal plan
should contain a finding that such plan conforms to the workable program of the
City and such other findings as may be necessary or desirable, but need not
contain the other finding set forth in subsection (e) hereof for approval of
urban renewal or redevelopment plans. Such approval of a general neighborhood
renewal plan may be made before or at the same time as the approval of an urban
renewal or redevelopment plan for a project within the general neighborhood
renewal area.
 
   (e)   The ordinance of Council approving an urban renewal or redevelopment
plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)   Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area
which make it a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, and finds
that the project area is a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area.
      (2)   That the size and character of the area and the location of
elements of slum blight and deterioration in the area make it appropriate for
urban renewal activities.
      (3)   That the proposals for the proper relocation of individuals and
families displaced in carrying out the project in decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings in conformity with acceptable standards are feasible and can be
reasonably and timely effected to permit the proper prosecution and completion
of the project; and that such dwellings or dwelling units available or to be
made available to such displaced individuals and families are at least equal in
number to the number of displaced individuals and families, are not generally
less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities than the dwellings of the displaced individuals and families in the
project area, are available at rents or prices within the financial means of
the displaced individuals and families, and are reasonably accessible to their
places of employment.
      (4)   (This finding is made only if Federal aid is needed.) That
financial aid to be provided by the Federal government under its contract is
necessary to enable the project to be undertaken in accordance with the plan.
      (5)   That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise.
      (6)   That the plan conforms to the existing general or master plan for
the overall development of the City as prepared by the Planning Commission
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 713.02.
      (7)   That the plan gives due consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities, as may be desirable for
neighborhood improvement with special consideration for the health, safety and
welfare of the children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by
the plan.
      (8)   (This finding is to be made only if there is included in the plan
any provision permitting the new construction of hotels, motels or other
housing for transient use.) That the City has caused to be made a competent
independent analysis of the local supply of transient housing and as a result
thereof determines that there exists in the project area a need for additional
units of such housing.
      (9)   (This finding is to be made only if the project area is not
predominantly residential in character and is not to be redeveloped for
predominantly residential use.) That the redevelopment of the project area for
predominantly nonresidential uses is necessary for the proper development of
the community.
      (10)   (This finding is to be made only where an open space land program
is involved.) That the land and the interests in land to be acquired are for
the purpose of preserving such area as open space land and are necessary to
orderly long range development, to curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban
blight and deterioration, to encourage more economical and desirable urban
development and to provide areas for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation
areas, watersheds and to preserve natural resources and that the area so to be
acquired is of a size and character appropriate for such purposes.
      (11)   (This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
clearing is the sole treatment proposed.) That the objectives of the urban
renewal plan cannot be achieved through rehabilitation of the urban renewal
area.
      (12)   (This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved and
both clearance and rehabilitation treatment are proposed.) That the objectives
of the urban renewal plan cannot be achieved through more extensive
rehabilitation of the urban renewal area.
      (13)   (This finding is to be made only if Federal aid is involved.) That
the United States of America and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
are assured of full compliance by the City with regulations of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development effectuating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964.
      (14)   (This finding is to be made only where an educational institution
or a hospital is located in or near the project area and it is desired to
utilize Section 112 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.) That, in addition
to the elimination of slums and blight from such area, the undertaking of an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment project in such area will further promote
the public welfare and the proper development of the community: by making land
in such area available for disposition for uses in accordance with the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan, to such educational institution or
hospital for redevelopment in accordance with the uses specified in the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan; by providing, through the redevelopment of
the area in accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, a
cohesive neighborhood environment compatible with the functions and needs of
such educational institution or hospitals; or by any combination of the
foregoing.
 
   (f)   Any documents which were submitted to Council to support findings in
the ordinance should be filed by the Clerk of Council with a copy of the
ordinance.
 
   (g)   The taking effect of the ordinance approving an urban renewal or
redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the City
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
Federal government, the State of Ohio, any entity, instrumentality or
subdivision of either, or from any other entity or person for such purpose.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.09 FEDERAL AID CONTRACTS.
   Any contract with a Federal agency for loans, advances, grants or other
Federal aid to the City shall be approved by the Law Director as to form and
legality and after approval and authorization by ordinance of Council, shall be
executed by the Mayor.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.10 MODIFICATION OF URBAN RENEWAL AND GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD RENEWAL PLAN.
   An approved urban renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time; provided that if the boundaries of the
project area are extended to include any land (except land contained within the
right-of-way lines of a dedicated street or alley) not previously included
therein or if there is added a new type of urban renewal activity which
requires the acquisition of property or if there is any change in the land use
or redevelopment restrictions or if there is a change in the proposed location,
extent or character of a public improvement or utility within the project area
or in any other matter directly within the jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission to approve or disapprove under Ohio R.C. 713.02, or if such
amendment, modification or change is deemed by Council to be a substantial
change in the
urban renewal or redevelopment plan, then all of the proceedings provided for
in Sections
147.07 and
147.08 shall be carried out in connection with such amendment, modification or
change except that the findings to be made in the ordinance approving the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan shall be altered to fit the circumstances.
The land use or redevelopment restrictions applicable to any land previously
conveyed by the City may not be amended, modified or changed without the
consent of the property owner thereto.
   A general neighborhood renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time, provided that any such amendment,
modification or change shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its
written approval or recommendations pursuant to the provisions of Section
147.07.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.11 EXECUTION OF URBAN RENEWAL PROJECTS.
   (a)   Acquisition of Property. As authorized by Council, the Community
Renewal Administrator with the appropriate advice and assistance of the Law
Director, shall cause the necessary steps to be taken to acquire the parcels of
land in the project area in accordance with the urban renewal or redevelopment
plan, including but not limited to, the negotiation for such parcels, obtaining
appraisals, title examinations and reports, with the Mayor executing contracts
for any of such services and appropriate documents to transfer title to the
City; provided, that in the event appropriation of property is necessary,
Council shall initiate and carry out the necessary proceedings, with the
appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees, boards and
commissions of the City. Acquisitions may take place at any time after
compliance with Sections
147.07  and
147.08 .
 
   (b)   City Activities Preparing Property for Disposition. After any
necessary appropriations of City moneys and authorization of expenditures by
ordinances of Council; after Council action, where appropriate, to rezone
property, vacate or dedicate streets or other public places and provide for the
establishment and preservation of open space areas; after certification of
funds by the City Auditor, where appropriate; and after preparation of or
approval of legal form of contracts by the Law Director, the Mayor shall make
the contracts and cause the purchase of the necessary supplies and materials
and the provision of the necessary labor for such City activities as may be
necessary to carry out the urban renewal project, including but not limited to
the demolition, rehabilitation or repair of structures (whether voluntarily by
the private owners thereof or by the City for demonstration purposes in limited
numbers), the removal of pavement, sidewalks, lighting and trees, capping,
removal and relocation of City-owned utility lines, grading, construction of
site improvements and supporting facilities and the temporary lease, rental or
permission to let others use structures or parcels of land while owned by the
City, relocation activities and the enforcement of any applicable provisions of
law or conforming agreements relative to building, zoning, platting and the
repair or rehabilitation of land and structures remaining in private ownership.
 
   (c)   Disposition of Property. Council may authorize by ordinance the
transfer, lease or conveyance of any real property in accordance with and for
the purpose of the plan, subject to such lawful terms, conditions, restrictions
and covenants (including covenants running with the land) to assist in carrying
out the purposes of the plan. All dispositions of real property shall be at not
less than the fair value thereof determined by Council based upon the proposed
new uses and restrictions thereon to be imposed thereon under the urban renewal
plan by Council through zoning ordinances, private covenant or otherwise. Such
determination shall be made only after obtaining independent appraisals of such
fair value upon the aforesaid basis, which appraisals shall not be binding upon
the City. The manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and may
be by negotiation, with or without any competitive bidding, and such
competition and award of a disposition contract may be based on factors other
than price alone. Two weeks publication in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City shall be sufficient notice for the taking of competitive bids or of
the execution of a disposition contract without competitive bidding. The
financial qualifications and legal status of those proposing to acquire or
lease such real property shall be considered in all dispositions. The Mayor
shall execute, on behalf of the City, such instruments as may be necessary to
transfer, lease or convey such real property in the form approved by the Law
Director and authorized by Council, which form shall include all covenants
running with the land, including any portions of the plan incorporated by
reference, and shall execute any certificates of completion of improvements or
other appropriate instruments, on behalf of the City, that may be necessary in
accordance with any covenants in such instruments of lease or conveyance.
 
   (d)   Conforming Agreement with Owner. If the owner of property in the
project area is willing to make the use of his property conform to the urban
renewal or redevelopment plan and Council finds and determines that the
acquisition of such property by the City will not be necessary if so conformed,
the Mayor, upon Council authorization, may enter into a conforming agreement
upon such terms and security as may be authorized by Council. Such agreement
may provide for the acquisition of property upon continued failure of the
property owner to keep his agreement after notice from the City specifying such
failure.
 
   (e)   Council May Authorize Employment of Community Corporations. In the
execution of urban renewal or redevelopment projects, Council may authorize, as
to any appropriate projects or parts of projects, the employment of community
improvement corporations, community redevelopment corporations and metropolitan
housing authorities, as defined by the statutes of Ohio, and when authorized by
ordinance of Council may grant leases, make conveyances and enter into
agreements with such corporations related to appropriate aspects of such
projects to the full extent of the powers possessed by such corporations.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.12 FINANCE.
   The cost of urban renewal activities may be paid in whole or in part by the
City from appropriate general or special funds or accounts established in
accordance with City ordinances and applicable laws, and the City may accept
grants or gifts of moneys or real or personal property from persons, entities,
governments or taxing authorities to be used for the planning and financing of
such urban renewal activities. All bonds or notes payable from the general
credit and taxes of the City to finance the urban renewal activities shall be
issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 133.
Accounts shall be maintained for the carrying out of those urban renewal
activities being financed by loans or advances from the Federal government
separate from any other City accounts, including City accounts used to carry
out activities being financed by the City and no money or real or personal
property shall in any way be pledged as security for the repayment of any
Federal loans or advances, except the separately described portion of a project
area set aside for such purpose, together with the proceeds from the sale,
lease or temporary operation thereof and Federal capital grant moneys earned in
connection therewith in order to avoid violating statutory and constitutional
debt and tax limitations.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.13 BUILDING PERMITS.
   After approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan by Council, no
building permit shall be issued for the improvement or enlargement of any
existing structure or for the construction of a new structure, in the clearance
and redevelopment portion of the project area, except that such permit may be
issued for the repair of an existing structure when such repair is deemed
necessary by the Building Commissioner for the immediate preservation of the
public health and safety or is required by the redeveloper in accordance with
the redevelopment plan.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.14 TAX EXEMPTION.
   (a)   All property of the City, including funds, owned or held by it for the
purposes of this chapter shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an
execution, and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the
same nor shall judgment against the City be a charge or lien upon such
property; provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not
apply to or limit the right of obligees to pursue any remedies for the
enforcement of any pledge or lien given pursuant to this chapter by the City on
its rents, fees, grants or revenues from urban renewal or redevelopment
projects.
 
   (b)   The property of the City, acquired or held for the purposes of this
chapter on January 1 of any year is declared to be public property used
exclusively for essential public and governmental purposes and such property
shall be exempt from all taxes of the City, County, State or any taxing
authority thereof; provided, however, that such tax exemption shall terminate
when the City sells, leases or otherwise disposes of such property in a project
area to a purchaser or lessee which is not a person, corporation, partnership
or other association entitled to tax exemption with respect to such property.
(Ord. 68-40. Passed 4-22-68.)
147.15 SEPARABILITY; CONFLICT.
   Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby
declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held
invalid, the remainder of the chapter and the application of such provision to
persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall
not be affected thereby.
   Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this chapter shall
be controlling. The powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and
supplemental to the powers conferred by other law.

of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by such
employer to such employee.
   In making such deduction at the time of payment, the employer shall compute
the tax to the nearest full cent, so that mills of five or more shall be

interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under

certified mail a written statement showing the amount of the tax so fixed
together with the interest and penalties thereon, if any. The tax shall be

employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed
and required to furnish to the Administrator or his duly authorized agent or
employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for making such examination and
investigations as are hereby authorized.

or presumed to be subject to the tax shall be deemed a violation of this

hearing before the Board of Review. Any person divulging such information in
violation of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the first

a return has been filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon within the time
prescribed herein; and provided further, that, in the absence of fraud, neither

taxes due. Such assessment may be based upon any information in the possession
of the Administrator, including estimates based upon the taxpayer's previous
returns.
   (d)   In each case, the Administrator shall give to the person assessed,
written notice of assessment. Such notice may be served by certified mail,

directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or

under oath, by such employer or taxpayer, such assessment shall become
inclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable. The petition must
state with particularity the objections to the assessment.
   (f)   When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Administrator shall set

not be refunded unless a claim for refund is made within three years from the

182.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer

Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in

182.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
182.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
182.091  of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)

used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.

shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
182.07  of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03 (23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03  of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

182.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation for work
done, or services performed or rendered outside of the City, if it be made to
appear that he has paid a municipal income tax on such net profits, salary,
wages, commission or other compensation to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit on the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by
him or in his behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed

or compensation earned in such other municipality or municipalities where such
tax is paid.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
 
182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081  of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
182.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
182.051 (C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service

other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net

submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.

   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10  of this Chapter.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.

to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99  of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-118A. Passed 11-9-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a

Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately

   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
182.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

City Treasurer as herein provided. Any person required to collect the tax
imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or having collected
the same, fails to remit the same to the City Treasurer in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure be the result of his own act
or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax, and shall, unless the
remittance be made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of this
chapter. The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission

reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the City Treasurer in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the tenth day of the
month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made
by check, unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the City
Treasurer, but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax

unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct amount. The person
receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms
and setting forth such information as the City Treasurer may require, showing
the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding
monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the City Treasurer with
a remittance for such amount. However, the City Treasurer may, in his
discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving admission
payments setting forth such additional information as he may deem necessary to
determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
(1968 Code Sec. 701.04)

admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of
the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the City Treasurer shall
determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the City Treasurer as to
report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied
shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable times
subject to examination and audit by the City Treasurer or his duly authorized
agent.
   If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be

   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the City Treasurer,
make application to and procure from the City Treasurer, a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00). Such certificate

Such certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be
issued by the City Treasurer without additional charge, shall be displayed in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.
(1968 Code Sec. 701.06)
183.07 CERTIFICATE FOR TEMPORARY SHOWS; JOINT LIABILITY.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
183.05 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person receiving
the admission charge made in connection therewith. The applicant for a
certificate of registration for such purpose shall furnish with the application
therefor the name and address of the owner, lessee or custodian of the premises
upon which the amusement is to be conducted, and such owner, lessee or
custodian shall be notified by the City Treasurer of the issuance of such
certificate and the joint liability for collection and remittance of such tax.
(1968 Code Sec. 701.07)
183.08 RULES AND REGULATIONS.

inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City at last once before they shall become effective and copies shall be

      (1)   Bids will first be evaluated to determine that a bidder’s offering

(d). Information furnished by the bidder pursuant to Section
189.04(b)(1) shall be relied upon in making this determination. Any bidder’s

quality.
      (2)   Following the determination as to domestic source end products,
remaining bids and proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with subsections
(b) and (c) hereof so as to give preference to Muskingum County bids or Ohio
bids or bidders who are located in a border state, provided that the border
state imposes no greater restrictions than contained in this system of
preferences.
   (b)   Buy Muskingum County Compliance.
      (1)   Where the preliminary analysis of bids identifies the apparent low
bid as a Muskingum County bid, the City shall proceed with its standard

         D.   Whether the lowest Muskingum County bid, if any, offers a
disproportionately inferior product or service.

inferior product or service, the City shall propose a contract award to the low
Muskingum County bid at the bid price quoted.
      (4)   Where the City determines that it is not appropriate to award the
contract to a Muskingum County bidder, the City shall proceed with the
determination set forth in subsection (c) hereof.

sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality;

deemed to be an excessive price. An “excessive price” shall be a price that
exceeds by more than five percent (5%) the lowest non- Ohio bid submitted;
         D.   Whether the lowest Ohio bid, if any, offers a disproportionately
inferior product or service.
      (3)   Where the City determines that selection of the lowest Ohio bid, if
any, will not result in an excessive price or disproportionately inferior
product of services, the City shall propose a contract award to the low Ohio
bid at the bid price quoted. (Ord. 08-44(A). Passed 6-9-08.)
189.03 LOCAL LABOR/CONSTRUCTION SERVICES BID PREFERENCE.
   (a)   Contracts that involve the provisions of labor for construction,

Trade Union, the City shall proceed with its standard contract award practices
and procedures.

enterprise or an entity which will be utilizing a Local Work Force or Local
Trade Union, if any, offers a price the City deemed to be an excessive price.
An excessive price shall be a price that exceeds by more than five percent (5%)
the lowest bid submitted.
      (3)   Where the City determines that the labor/construction services can
be performed by a Muskingum County business enterprise or as an entity which

submitted. Otherwise the City shall proceed with its standard contract award
practices and procedures.
   (b)   In order to insure compliance with the Local Workforce Credit pledge,
the City will hold seven percent (7%) from the full amount of the bid until the

vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to

technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers

Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle

punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

signal that the lawful parking period has expired and in such cases the right
of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner,
possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter
provided. Such visible signal shall be prima-facie evidence of illegal parking
by such operator, owner, possessor or manager.
(Ord. 62-114. Passed 8-27-62.)
353.05 OPERATION OF PARKING METERS.
   Except in a period of emergency determined by the Director of Public Safety

parking meter is located, the operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the
parking meter space, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in such meter
such proper coin of the United States as is required for such parking meter,
and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required by
the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of
the proper coin or coins, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on
such meter in accordance with directions appearing thereon. Failure to deposit
such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required,

parking meter space adjacent to a meter which indicates that unused time has
been left in the meter by the previous occupant of the space, shall not be
required to deposit a coin as long as his occupancy of such space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time. If such vehicle shall remain parked
in any such parking space beyond the parking time limit set for such parking
space, and if the meter shall indicate such illegal parking, then, and in that
event, such vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime, and beyond the

Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 SEIZURE OF CONTRABAND; LAW ENFORCEMENT FUND.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby authorized and directed to accept cash, vehicles
and other property from the common pleas courts of the State in accordance with
the Contraband Seizure Forfeiture Act, Ohio R.C. 2933.43 and Ohio R.C. 2925.13
Permitting Drug Abuse.
   (b)   The acceptance of any real estate by the Mayor shall be subject to the

   (e)   The Law Enforcement Fund is hereby created, Account No. 201-9-1-4102.
The funds shall be expended as permitted by law, including but not limited to
payment to informants, purchases of drugs or other matters and such other uses
as are set forth in Ohio R.C. 2933.43. All funds expended from such fund shall
be accounted for in compliance with the requirements of the State Auditor's
office.
(Ord. 87-83. Passed 7-13-87.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment

seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

operating a cable television system within the City in accordance with the
terms and conditions of an existing franchise.
   (c)   The grantee to whom Council grants a non-exclusive franchise shall pay
to the City at the time the grantee files the written instrument specified in
Section
757.06(j), the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such payment shall
also be nonrefundable, shall be made to the order of the City of Zanesville and
shall be used to offset the direct costs incurred by the City in granting the
franchise.
(Ord. 76-146. Passed 12-13-76.)
757.03 FRANCHISE CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Term. The term of the franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall
be for a period of ten years beginning on the first day following the effective
date of this subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 83-84. Passed 5-23-83.)
   (b)   Notice to the Grantee. Council shall not hold any meeting involving
the review, renewal, revocation or termination of the grantee's franchise
unless the Mayor has:
      (1)   Advised the grantee in writing, at least sixty days prior to such
meeting, as to its time, place and purpose; and
      (2)   Published a notice at least once ten days before the meeting in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City.
         (Ord. 76-146. Passed 12-13-76.)
   (c)   Review.
      (1)   Within ninety days after the end of the fifth year and the ninth
year of the renewal of this franchise, Council may adopt a resolution setting
forth the time and place of a Council meeting, the purpose of which shall be to
consider grantee's performance, under the franchise agreement, as amended, and
the possible need for reasonable and appropriate modifications of this chapter,
or any amendment thereto, and the franchise agreement of a nature that would
not result in effectively terminating the same under the then existing Federal
Communications Commission Rules for Cable Television.
      (2)   Within the ninety day period, above provided, a preliminary review
of the franchise shall be conducted by a special committee of Council and their
recommendations forwarded to Council for its benefit and consideration.
         (Ord. 83-84. Passed 5-23-83.)
   (d)   Renewal.
      (1)   Council shall adopt a resolution setting forth the time and place
of a Council meeting to be held not less than twelve months prior to the
franchise expiration date, the purpose of which will be to review the grantee's
performance during the entire term of its franchise, to consider the adequacy
of this chapter and the franchise agreement from the standpoint of the City,
the grantee and the Federal Communications Commission's rules and regulations
relative to cable television and to determine the advisability of renewing the
grantee's franchise for a period not inconsistent with such FCC rules.
      (2)   Council shall hear any interested persons during such Council
meeting and shall determine whether or not the grantee did reasonably comply
with the terms and conditions imposed by this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
      (3)   If Council determines that the grantee has been in substantial
compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by this chapter and the
franchise agreement, Council may renew the grantee's franchise for a period of
time not inconsistent with the then prevailing FCC Rules for Cable Television
in which event Council shall modify this chapter and the franchise agreement to
bring them into compliance with the FCC Rules for Cable Television.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the fact that Council may determine that the
grantee has been in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions
imposed by this chapter and the franchise agreement, Council shall have the
right not to renew the franchise, in which event Council shall on the
expiration date of the franchise, have the option to either; (1) purchase the
assets of the grantee's cable television system serving the City and adjacent
areas at its then fair market value, (2) lease the assets of the grantee's
cable television system serving the City and adjacent areas for a sum based
upon its then fair market value, or (3) consistent with the provisions of
Section
757.03(j), select a new grantee after a full public proceeding and cause such
new grantee to purchase such assets at fair market value.
   (e)   Revocation Procedure.
      (1)   Whenever the grantee willfully fails, refuses or neglects to
operate or maintain its cable television system in accordance with the terms of
this chapter and the franchise agreement or to comply with the conditions of
street occupancy, or to make required extensions, or in other ways violates the
terms and conditions of this chapter, the Mayor may notify the grantee in
writing, setting forth the nature and facts of such noncompliance he believes
have occurred. If within thirty days following such written notification by the
Mayor, the grantee has not furnished proof that corrective action has been
taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, or evidence that the
alleged violations did not occur, the Mayor shall place a request for
termination of the franchise agreement on the agenda of the next regular
Council meeting.
      (2)   If, after considering the Mayor's request for termination of the
franchise agreement and hearing all interested parties, Council determines that
the noncompliance of the grantee was with just cause, it shall direct the
grantee to comply within such time and manner and on such terms and conditions
as are reasonable.
      (3)   If Council determines that such noncompliance was without just
cause, then Council may adopt a resolution that either (1) forthwith terminates
the franchise agreement and instructs the grantee to promptly remove from the
public way all of its cable television system facilities within ninety days
from the date the grantee receives a written copy of such resolution, (2)
invokes the City's right to purchase the assets of the grantee's cable
television system serving the City and adjacent areas, including the head-end,
at a price not exceed its depreciated value as defined herein, or, (3) invokes
the City's right to lease the assets of the grantee's cable television system
serving the City, including the head-end, for a sum based upon its depreciated
value as defined herein, unless there is compliance by the grantee within such
period as Council may fix.
      (4)   In addition to all the other rights reserved to the City by virtue
of this chapter or otherwise, the City may invoke the rights as defined in
subsection (e)(3) hereof in the event:
         A.   The grantee becomes insolvent, or unable or unwilling to pay its
debts or is adjudged bankrupt.
         B.   The grantee attempts to or does practice any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its subscribers.
      (5)   No revocation or termination of the franchise agreement shall be
effected unless Council, at any regular or special meeting at which all
interested parties have been heard, has adopted a resolution setting forth the
reasons for the termination; in the event the termination of such agreement
depends upon a finding of fact, such finding of fact as made by Council after
such hearing shall be deemed to be conclusive unless modified as a result of
arbitration provided for in Section
757.06(h).
      (6)   The grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any
sanction under any provision of this chapter in any case in which performance
of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control.
      (7)   The termination of the franchise agreement shall in no way affect
any of the rights of the City under this chapter, the franchise agreement or
any provision of law.
   (f)   Termination for Cause of Forced Purchase by City.
      (1)   If at any time during the term of this franchise, Council
determines the grantee has materially breached the terms and conditions imposed
by this chapter and the franchise agreement after the City has exhausted all of
the remedial steps provided for herein, the City may either terminate the
franchise agreement or purchase or lease the assets of the grantee's cable
television system serving the City and adjacent areas including the head-end,
at a cost based on depreciated value as hereinbefore provided.
      (2)   In the event the City exercises its option to purchase or lease the
assets of the grantee's cable television system within the City at their
depreciated value, it shall give the grantee written notice of its intent to do
so. The grantee shall within seven days of receipt of such notice, enter into
bona fide negotiations with the City for the purpose of consummating the
transaction at the earliest possible moment.
   (g)   Arbitrary and Capricious Action by Grantee. If, as a result of a
dispute between the grantee and the City and prior to a settlement of that
dispute as provided for herein, the grantee arbitrarily or capriciously
discontinues service to its subscribers, the grantee shall forfeit its rights
of notice and a hearing as provided for Sections
757.03(b) and (e), and Council shall by resolution declare the grantee's
franchise agreement immediately terminated, and the City shall forthwith seek
appropriate judicial injunction relief and shall proceed to exercise its rights
and powers as provided for herein.
   (h)   Provision for Arbitration. In the event the City elects to purchase or
lease the grantee's cable television system at the fair market value or its
depreciated value and the terms and conditions of such purchase or lease cannot
be agreed upon, the final terms and conditions shall be determined by
arbitration as described in Section
757.06(h).
   (i)   Transfer of Ownership to City.
      (1)   Upon execution of the purchase agreement or lease agreement and any
payment that may be stipulated therein, the grantee shall immediately transfer
to the City possession, and in the case of purchase, title to all facilities
and property, real and personal, related to those cable television system
assets being purchased, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed
to be assumed by the City in lieu of some portion of the purchase price or
lease payment. The grantee shall execute such warranty deeds, lease agreements,
operating agreements or other instruments of conveyance to the City as are
necessary.
      (2)   The grantee shall make it a condition of each contract entered into
by it with reference to its operation under this chapter and the franchise
agreement, that each contract shall be subject to the exercise of these options
by the City, and that the City shall have the right to succeed to all
privileges and obligations thereof upon the exercise thereof.
   (j)   City's Right to Assign. The City shall have the right and power to
assign its purchase rights of the grantee's cable television system to a
successor grantee selected by the City in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this chapter and the Federal Communications Commission's rules
and regulations for cable television.
   (k)   Grantee's Obligation as Trustee.
      (1)   Until such time as the grantee transfers to the City or to a new
grantee possession and in the case of purchase, title to the cable television
system assets, real and personal, being transferred hereunder, the grantee
shall, as trustee for its successor in interest, continue to operate the cable
television system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and
all of the services that may be provided at that time. During such interim
period, the grantee shall not make any material, administrative or operational
change that would tend to:
         A.   Degrade the quality of service to the subscribers,
         B.   Decrease income, or
         C.   Materially increase expenses without the express permission in
writing of the City or its assignee.
      (2)   The grantee's obligation as trustee applies to all the
circumstances under which it may be required to continue to provide subscriber
services under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
   (l)   Management Fee. For its management services during the interim period,
the grantee shall be entitled to receive as compensation, the net profit, as
defined herein, generated during the period between the date the grantee
received written notice from the City of its intent to purchase or lease the
grantee's cable television system or the expiration date of the franchise,
whichever is earlier, and the payment of the purchase or lease price. Such
management services shall not continue without the grantee's consent for more
than nine months. However, if Council determines that the grantee is
responsible for any delay in transfer of control and, in the case of purchase,
ownership, the grantee shall continue to operate the cable television system as
provided in subsection (k) hereof without compensation for its services until
the sale agreement or lease agreement is executed and control and, in case of
purchase, ownership passes to the City or its assignee. In addition, the City
shall also have the right to:
      (1)   Forthwith terminate the grantee's franchise and have the system
removed, or
      (2)   Purchase the assets of the grantee's cable television system at its
depreciated value.
   (m)   Franchise Fee.
      (1)   The grantee shall pay to the City, in consideration of the granting
of the franchise to use the public ways for the operation of a cable television
system, three percent (3%) of its annual gross subscriber revenues as defined
herein during the period of its operation under the franchise agreement.
      (2)   The grantee shall file with the City, within thirty days after the
expiration of each of the grantee's fiscal quarter, a financial statement
clearly showing the gross subscriber revenues received by the grantee during
the preceding quarter. Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee
shall be payable to the City at the time such statement is filed. The grantee
shall also file, within 120 days following the conclusion of the grantee's
fiscal year, an annual report prepared and audited by a certified public
account acceptable to the City, clearly detailing the yearly total gross
subscriber revenues.
      (3)   The City shall have the right, consistent with the provisions of
Section
757.04(b)(2), to inspect the grantee's income records, the right of audit and
the recomputation of any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter
provided that such audit shall take place within twelve months following the
close of each of the grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due the City
as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty days following written
notice to the grantee by the City which notice shall include a copy of the
audit report. The cost of such audit shall be borne by the grantee if it is
properly determined that the grantee's annual payment to the City for the
preceding year is increased thereby by more than five percent (5%).
      (4)   In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not
made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
charged from such due date at the annual rate of nine percent (9%).
      (5)   In the event the franchise agreement is terminated prior to its
expiration date, and the City invokes its right to purchase or lease the
grantee's cable television system, the grantee shall file with the City within
thirty days of the date that control and, in the case of purchase, ownership
passes to the City or its assignee, a financial statement clearly detailing
gross subscriber revenues received by the grantee since the end of the previous
fiscal quarter. The grantee shall pay the franchise fee due at the time such
statement is filed.
   (n)   Insurance; Bonds; Indemnity.
      (1)   Upon the filing of the acceptance required under Section
757.06(j) and at all times during the term of the franchise, including the time
for removal of facilities or management as a trustee as provided for herein,
the grantee shall obtain, pay all premiums for, and file with the City Auditor
written evidence of payment of premiums and executed duplicate copies of the
following:
         A.   A general comprehensive public liability policy indemnifying,
defending and saving harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions,
agents or employees from any and all claims by any person whatsoever on account
of injury to or death of a person or persons occasioned by the operation of the
grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused
or occurred, with a minimum liability of five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) per personal injury or death of any one person and one million
dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury or death of any two or more persons in
any one occurrence.
         B.   Property damage insurance indemnifying, defending and saving
harmless the City, its officer, boards, commissions, agents and employees from
and against all claims by any person whatsoever for property damage occasioned
by the operation of the grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged
to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for property damage to the property of any
one person and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for any property damage
to the property of two or more persons in any one occurrence.
         C.   Copyright infringement insurance, indemnifying, defending and
saving harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and
employees from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for copyright
infringement occasioned by the operation of the grantee under the franchise
herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum
liability of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for the infringement of such
copyrights.
         D.   A performance bond running to the City with good and sufficient
surety approved by the City in the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000)
conditioned upon the faithful performance and discharge of the obligations
imposed by this chapter and the franchise agreement executed hereunder from the
date thereof.
      (2)   The bond and all insurance policies called for herein shall list
the City of Zanesville as co-insured and shall be in a form satisfactory to the
Law Director and shall require thirty days written notice of any modification
thereof or cancellation to the City Auditor and the grantee. The grantee shall,
in the event of any such cancellation notice, obtain, pay all premiums for and
file with the City Auditor, written evidence of payment of premiums, duplicate
policies of any insurance so cancelled within thirty days following receipt by
the City Auditor and/or the grantee of any notice of cancellation.
      (3)   The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold
harmless the City, its officials, boards, commissions, agents and employees
against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments
for damage arising out of the operation of the cable television system under
the franchise. These damages shall include, but not be limited to, penalties
arising out of any failure of the grantee to secure consents from the owners,
authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the
grantee's cable television system whether or not any act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise.
      (4)   The foregoing indemnity is conditioned upon the City's giving the
grantee notice of the commencement or making of any suit or action covered by
the terms of this section. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the City
from cooperating with the grantee and participating in the defense of any
litigation by its own counsel at its sole cost and expense. No recovery by the
City of any sum by reason of the bond required in this chapter shall be any
limitation upon the liability of the grantee to the City under the terms of
this chapter except that any sums so received by the City shall be deducted
from any recovery which the City shall establish against the grantee under the
terms of this chapter.
   (o)   Transfer of Franchise.
      (1)   The franchise granted under this chapter shall be a privilege to be
held in personal trust by the grantee. It shall not be assigned, transferred,
sold or disposed of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale, merger,
consolidation or otherwise, or by forced or involuntary sale, without prior
consent of Council expressed by resolution and then only on such conditions as
may therein be prescribed.
      (2)   Any sale, transfer or assignment shall be made by a bill of sale or
similar document, an executed copy which shall be filed with the Mayor within
thirty days after any such sale, transfer or assignment. Council shall not
withhold its consent unreasonably provided the proposed assignee agrees, in
writing, to comply with all the provisions of this chapter and the franchise
and must be able to provide proof of financial responsibility as determined by
Council.
      (3)   No such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage
or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or part, to secure an
indebtedness except that when such hypothecation exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the fair market value (as defined in Section
 757.01) of such property, prior consent of Council, expressed by resolution,
shall be required for such transfer, and such consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably.
      (4)   When there is an actual change in control of the grantee's
corporation or where ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
grantee's voting stock is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in
concert, none of whom already owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the grantee's
voting stock, singly or collectively, prior consent of Council, expressed by
resolution, shall be required, and such consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably.
      (5)   The consent of Council to any sale, transfer, lease, trust,
mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation shall not constitute a waiver or
release of any of the rights of the City under this chapter and the franchise
agreement.

Section 623(e) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. When an FM
outlet is located in the subscriber's premises there will be no additional
monthly charge; however, for FM subscription services only, a sum not to exceed

charges provided in this paragraph.
      (3)   The grantee shall not, with regard to fees, service facilities,

their behalf for regular subscriber service provided to ten or more dwelling
units within an apartment building, condominium, garden apartment or townhouse
complex under common ownership, or to ten or more room units within hotels and
motels.
      (4)   The grantee shall have the authority and the right to add to its
service or installation fees any Federal, State or City taxes directly imposed
on the grantee or his subscribers.
      (5)   Grantee may, at its own discretion, waive, reduce or suspend
connection fees for specific or indeterminate periods and/or the monthly

the sum of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) as compensation to grantee for
the loss of the converter.
   (b)   Books and Records.
      (1)   The grantee will, within thirty days following acceptance of the

location within any area of the City or any area that may be annexed by the
City subsequent to the granting of the franchise upon the written request of
five or more applicants living within 500 yards of each other.
      (2)   The grantee shall be entitled to recover from the applicants
requesting service extensions in the City within such annexed areas the direct

library building and such municipally owned buildings as may be designated by
the City; provided that if it is necessary to extend the grantee's trunk or
feeder lines more than 300 feet solely to provide service to any such school or
public building, the City shall have the option either of paying the grantee's
direct costs for such extension in excess of 300 feet, or of releasing the
grantee from the obligation to provide service to such building. The grantee
shall be permitted to recover from any public building owner entitled to free
service, the direct cost of installing when requested to do so, more than one
outlet, or concealed inside wiring, or a service outlet requiring more than 250

C.F.R. 76.92, during times at which the programming on Station WHIZ is the same
as other programming broadcast by grantee, grantee will broadcast WHIZ on both
the channel on which grantee ordinarily broadcasts Station WHIZ and the channel
on which grantee ordinarily broadcasts such other programming.
      (4)   Initially, grantee shall provide one channel for all of the access
programming described herein. Grantee shall, upon demonstration of need by
grantor, provide additional channels for access purposes.
      (5)   Grantor shall be permitted to have access to grantee's cable system

   (c)   Operational Requirements and Records.
      (1)   The grantee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable

with this chapter including applicable amendments of the Federal Communications
Commission and all other applicable federal, State or City laws and

television system and all its parts shall be subject to inspection by the City,
provided that electrical tests shall be limited to those set forth in
subsection (d) hereof.
      (2)   The grantee shall at all times collect and promptly remit to the
appropriate government authority any tax that may be legally imposed on the
grantee or the grantee's subscribers.
      (3)   The grantee shall maintain an office within the City which shall be

filed by the grantee with federal or State agencies having appropriate
jurisdiction in matters affecting cable television system operation shall be
simultaneously filed with the Mayor.
   (d)   Tests and Performance Monitoring.
      (1)   Not later than ninety days after any new or substantially rebuilt
portion of the system is made available for service to subscribers, technical
performance tests shall be conducted by the grantee to demonstrate full
compliance with the technical standards of the Federal Communications
Commission and subsection (c)(4) hereof. Such tests shall be performed by or
under the supervision of a qualified registered professional engineer or an
engineer with proper training and experience. A copy of the report shall
forthwith be submitted to the Mayor describing test results, instrumentation
calibration, and test procedures and the qualifications of the engineer
responsible for the tests.
      (2)   System monitor test points shall be established at or near the
output of the last amplifier in the longest feeder line, at or near trunk line
extremities, at not fewer than four widely scattered locations. At least once

files for not less than five years:
         A.   Visual and aural carrier level on each active channel.
         B.   Carrier-to-noise ratio on at least four frequencies distributed
across the pass band (to avoid interrupting service, these measurements may be
approximate and will be used only to detect significant changes).
         C.   Visual inspection of picture quality on all active channels to
detect degradation in quality attributable to the system.
      (3)   At any time the City may require additional tests, full or partial
repeat tests, different test procedures or tests involving a specific

basis of complaints received or other evidence indicating an unresolved
controversy or significant noncompliance, and such tests will be limited to the
particular matter in controversy. The City will endeavor to so arrange its
requests for such special tests as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the
grantee or the subscribers.
      (4)   A copy of the annual performance tests report required by the
Federal Communications Commission shall be simultaneously submitted to the

relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority
of the City to grant such franchise.
      (2)   The grantee by executing the franchise agreement acknowledges that

FCC Rules and Regulations. The grantee shall at all times comply with all laws,
or ordinances, rules and regulations of the City, the State and the federal
government in the construction and operation of its cable television system.
All rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission or
appropriate State agencies having regulatory jurisdiction over cable franchises

or void or that the City did not have the authority to impose such term or
condition.
   (d)   Failure to Enforce Franchise. The grantee shall not be excused from
complying with any of the terms and conditions of this chapter or the franchise

more of such terms or conditions.
   (e)   Rights Reserved to the City. The City hereby expressly reserves the

grounds for the City to invoke the remedies available under the terms and
conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement.

the grantee shall constitute acceptance of the terms and conditions imposed by
this chapter. The execution of the franchise agreement shall take place within

Service or his authorized subordinates, shall make any opening, excavation or
cut in, or remove any pavement, sod or other surface material from any street
or other thoroughfare, or from any park or other public grounds, unless such

Service. However, the provisions of this and Section

(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.02 APPLICATION INFORMATION; FEE.
   The application provided for in Section 901.01 shall set forth the number,
size and location of excavations desired to be made, or the location and extent
of pavement or other surface desired to be removed, shall state the purpose
thereof, and shall state the method of excavation and of making connections

pay to the City the fees outlined on the application, as reimbursement for any
cost of necessary preliminary investigations or inspections.
(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.03 PERMIT ISSUANCE; CONDITIONS AND DEPOSIT.
   The Director of Public Service shall not issue any permit to cut or excavate
any street,
thoroughfare, park or other public ground unless for some lawful purpose, and
unless such cut or excavation is reasonably necessary. He may in granting any
permit modify any particulars of the application therefor, and impose
conditions therein, for the purpose of minimizing any inconvenience or injury
to the public and the public property thereby. He shall not issue such permit
until the applicant shall have deposited with the City a sum of money
sufficient to defray the cost of refilling such excavation, removing any excess
materials and restoring the pavement or other surface, as may be required by
ordinance and to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Service.
   The deposit to be made under this section shall be at the rate identified on
the application.
(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.04 DRIVING PIPES; TUNNELING.
   The Director of Public Service may require the driving of pipes in cases
where soil conditions and other circumstances render such driving practicable,

(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.05 PROGRESS OF WORK; COVERING.
   All excavation in the streets, thoroughfares, parks and public places, and

every such excavation, or any part thereof designated by him, shall be securely
covered over with such materials and in such manner as to permit the passage of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic with the least interference or delay.
(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.06 EXCAVATED MATERIALS; REMOVAL OR FILLING.
   Material from any excavation in any street, thoroughfare, park or public

901.07 BACKFILL REQUIREMENTS.
   Every person who makes any excavation in any street, thoroughfare, park or
public ground, as soon as the installation or connection is made, shall
backfill such excavation up to the surface, with earth or backfilling material
in layers not deeper than six inches each, thoroughly compacted by ramming or
flushing. If the permittee fails to do any such backfilling to the satisfaction
of the Director of Public Service, he shall remove all unsatisfactory

and expense of the permittee.
(Ord. 2024-117. Passed 9-9-24.)
901.08 PAVEMENT RESTORATION.

or other surfacing is restored to his satisfaction he shall determine the
restoration cost to the City, including the cost of all such inspections, of
all backfilling done by the City, of all labor and material expended in
repairing or resurfacing, and a reasonable charge for overhead services. The
Director shall certify such cost to the City Auditor, who shall thereupon issue
a receiving warrant or voucher, to transfer to the General Fund so much of the
deposit made in respect of such improvement as may be necessary to defray the
cost so certified, and shall return any balance in such deposit to the
depositor. If the cost so certified exceeds the amount deposited, the City
Auditor shall proceed forthwith to collect the remainder due the City. However,
in lieu of the deposit required by Section
901.03 and the procedure provided in this section, the applicant for the permit
may deposit the sum identified on the permit in cash with the Director of

on deposit, be required to make the deposit called for in Section
901.03, provided that upon the restoration of the pavement or other surfacing
and upon being billed for the cost as stipulated in this section, the applicant
shall pay to the City the cost, as certified by the Director, and shall
continue to pay upon being billed for each successive opening thereafter. (Ord.

or to pay any balances due the City, by reason of work done in connection with

911.02 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation,
planning, management and administration of the use or occupation of all Rights-
of-Way in the City, the issuance of Right-of-Way permits to Persons for such
use or occupancy and to set forth the policies of the City related thereto.
   (b)   A Right-of-Way Permit issued pursuant to this chapter does not take
the place of any Service Permit, franchise, license, or permit which may be
additionally required by law, including any required by Chapter
757 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Zanesville. Each Permittee shall
obtain any and all such additional state, federal or City franchises, licenses
or permits necessary to the operation and conduct of its business or the
occupation or use of any Right-of-Way; provided, however, that no Permittee
holding a valid Right-of-Way Permit shall be required to obtain a Service
Permit for any type of services rendered by said Permittee for which the City
did not require Service Permits at the time said Permittee's Permit was last
issued or renewed. Should there be a direct conflict between the provisions of
this Chapter and a valid Service Permit, the provisions of the Service Permit
shall prevail; provided, however, that additional obligations shall not be
construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The Director is hereby directed and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)    The City's policy regarding Rights-of-Way is: To promote the

communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technology and innovative services, to the City's residents and taxpayers at
reasonable costs;

occupation of Rights-of-Way, or work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during Right-of-Way work, and ensure safe and efficient use of
the City's streets, Rights-of-Way, and easements, and eliminate wasteful,
unnecessary or unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (3)    To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (4)    To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
Rights-of- Way and the costs related thereto, including the regulation thereof;
      (5)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
Rights- of-Way; and when all requests for Right-of-Way use cannot be

no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting of a Permit
under this chapter.
   (f)    This chapter does not apply, and nothing herein should be construed
to apply the provisions of this chapter, to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the City or any City operations that occupy or use the Rights-of-
Way. It is specifically contemplated, however, that all City Departments or
Divisions that utilize the Rights-of-Way shall carry out their operations in a
manner consistent with the policy set forth in this chapter, including

Right-of-Way Permit issued hereunder; provided that, for purposes of this
chapter, Public Utilities subject to the jurisdiction and recognized on the
rolls of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) or a cable operator
possessing a valid franchise under federal law and applicable laws of the City
shall be presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial

with; provided, however, that such Right-of-Way Permit shall only relate to and
entitle the Permittee to utilize the Rights-of-Way, in accordance with this

   (b)   All other applications for General Right-of-Way Permits, or amendments
or renewals thereof, shall be filed in such form and in such manner as required

receipt of a complete application, issue a written report regarding such
application. The report shall recommend that the Right-of-Way Board deny or
grant the Right-of-Way Permit, subject to any appropriate terms and conditions,
in accordance with the criteria set forth in this chapter. The Director's

is in order and that the criteria set forth in Section
911.05 have been met, and that the application should be granted, the Director
shall, within forty-five (45) days of a receipt of a completed application,
conditionally grant or renew such a Right-of-Way Permit subject to any
appropriate terms and conditions or deny the same. The Director shall notify
the Right-of-Way Board of the results of such review. The Director's
conditional grant, renewal or denial shall be served upon the Applicant by
mail. Such conditional denial, grant or renewal shall become final unless
modified or rejected by the Right-of-Way Board within thirty (30) days of
issuance by the Director, or unless appealed pursuant to Section

years from issuance, or such lesser term as the Applicant requests.
   A Special Right-of-Way Permit for Residential Purposes may be granted for an
indefinite term from issuance, but may be canceled by the Director with sixty
(60) days written notice. Should the Director find that an emergency exists,
the Director may cancel said Permit within a lesser time period.

Application the Director shall review said application for conformance with the

911.04(h). If the Application should be determined to be incomplete, the
Director shall promptly notify the Applicant of any and all information
required. Further processing will be delayed until all such additional
information has been received by the Director. Following the approval of the
Director the Applicant shall be notified in writing of the approval by the City
with the City forwarding an approved copy of the application to the Applicant's
Designated Single Point of Contact. The Applicant must then conform to the
provisions of the Permit and the provisions of Section

911.04(h). Any such payment amounts must be received by the City in order to
validate the Permit.
   (e)   Permit Renewal. The Permittee shall file an application to renew its

under consideration now or in the future. The City reserves the right to
require digital mapping requirements in line with any proposed GIS System that
may be considered now or in the future. The City shall work with the Permittees
to determine a suitable date for the Permittees to provide such maps and
information in a digital format. At this time the following mapping
requirements shall apply:
      (1)   No later than June 30, 2003, existing General Right-of-Way
Permittees shall provide evidence that existing facilities are registered with
OUPS or any other underground reporting service organization as indicated in
this chapter. For any other future planned facilities after the effective date
of this chapter, applicants will file with the Director a schematic drawing, in
a form that is readily available to the applicant, of their proposed facilities
that they own or over which they have control with the Rights-of-Way. Said
drawing may be general in nature and shall at a minimum, locate, describe and
identify all uses of, and "as built" structures and facilities of such
Permittee in the Rights-of-Way as proposed and/or in existence including the
miles of Right-of-Way involved. Detailed drawings shall be required of all
General Right-of-Way Permit Applicants proposing to occupy public lands outside
public Rights-of-Way.
      (2)   Special Right-of-Way Permit Applicants for both Residential
Purposes and Nonresidential Purposes shall provide a semi-detailed schematic
drawing of their existing or proposed facilities in a form that is acceptable
to the City. This drawing shall include: the location of said facilities
relative to the existing City Rights-of-Way and or public lands, the size, type
and construction of the facility involved.
      (3)   Upon request from the Public Service Director within one hundred
twenty (120) days after new construction in the Right-of-Way has been
completed, a Permittee shall furnish “as-built” drawings that are readily
available to the Permittee.
   (d)   Establishment of Utility Corridors. The Director may assign specific
corridors within the Rights-of-Way, or any particular segment thereof as may be
necessary, for each type of facilities that are or that the Director expects
may someday be located within the Rights-of- Way. All excavation, construction
or other Permits issued by the City involving the installation or replacement
of equipment may designate the proper corridor for location of the equipment in
question.
      (1)   Any Permittee whose facilities are in the Right-of-Way and are in a
position at variance with the established utility corridors established by the
Director shall at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the
area, excluding normal maintenance activities, move such equipment to its
assigned position within the Rights-of-Way. This requirement may be waived by
the Director for good cause shown including consideration of such factors as:
the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs and hardship to the Permittee.
      (2)   If there is insufficient space within the Right-of-Way to
accommodate all of the requests of the Permittees, the Director shall have the
power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within
the Rights-of- Way. The Director shal1 make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Right-of-Way as set forth
in Section
911.02 of this chapter.
      (3)   Permittees shall cooperate to use existing poles and conduits for
installing their systems within the Rights-of-Way, consistent with PUCO

      (4)    No pole or other fixture placed in any Right-of-Way shall be
placed in such a manner that interferes with normal travel on such Right-of-
Way.
      (5)   Unless otherwise stated in the Permit, all facilities within the
Rights-of-Way shall be constructed, installed and located in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and in accordance with the following provisions:
         A.   Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in a
certain area within the City, a Permittee who desires to place its facility in
the same area must also locate its facilities, such as drops that cross private
property, underground;
         B.   Whenever the owner of poles are required to locate or relocate
facilities underground within a certain area of the City, every Permittee with
facilities within the same area of the City shall concurrently relocate their
facilities underground.
   (e)   Cooperation with Adjacent Property Owners. Permittees shall cooperate
with owners and developers of private property adjacent to the Rights-of-Way in
the construction of private turn lanes, driveway approaches, roadway widening
or other improvements which may require the Permittee to remove or relocate its
facilities, provided, however, that the Permittee's expenses have been
reasonably secured by the owner or developer who initiated said removal or
relocation.
   (f)   Facility Ownership Responsibility. Owners of facilities, poles,
conduits, vaults and other structures that are located within the Rights-of-Way
of the City shall have the responsibility for removal or relocation of such
facilities whenever required and shall coordinate the removal or relocation
with any other Permittee who has facilities attached to or enclosed within the
owner's facilities. Permittees neglecting or refusing to cooperate with the
facility owner in a timely fashion concerning said removal or relocation of
facilities shall be deemed to be in violation of Section
911.06(a)(4) of this chapter.
   (g)   Emergency Repairs. Each Permittee shall immediately notify the City of
any emergency situation that involves its facilities and that will require
excavation and/or occupancy of the Right-of-Way. The Permittee may proceed with
whatever actions it deems necessary to respond to the emergency. Upon securing
the site in question from imminent danger, all other provisions of this chapter
and any rules and regulations related thereto shall apply.
      (1)   To the reasonable extent that the City becomes aware of an
emergency regarding Permittee's facilities within the Right-of-Way, the City
shall attempt to contact the local representative of each Permittee known by
the City to be affected by the situation. In doing so the City will use the
twenty- four (24) hour emergency number(s) provided by each Permittee. However,
the City cannot and does not insure that every such contact will be made every
such instance.
      (2)   Should the Permittee's facilities create or contribute to an
imminent danger to health, safety or property, the City may take such
necessary, temporary steps as are required to protect the public safety.
   (h)    Removal of Graffiti. Within fourteen (14) calendar days notice, a
Permittee shall remove any and all graffiti on any of the Permittee's
facilities located within the City Rights-of- Way. Should the Permittee fail to
do so, the City may take whatever action is necessary to remove the graffiti
and bill the Permittee for the cost thereof. The Director may extend the period
for removal of graffiti if requested by any Permittee, if, in the Director's
sole opinion, such reasonable time extension is necessary.

   (d)   The Director shall establish additional or more stringent limitations
on wastewater strength and more stringent specific limitations and requirements
on individual dischargers where deemed necessary by the Director to comply with
the applicable Pretreatment Standards or the objectives set forth in Chapter
921. Such standards and requirements shall be published fifteen days prior to
their effective date in the largest newspaper of general circulation within the
City. Additionally, the Director shall notify in writing each regulated or
potentially regulated industrial discharger of the limitations or requirements.
All limitations and requirements established by the Director shall be rulings
subject to the provisions of Section
923.23. Local limits of wastewater strength can be found within the industrial
user discharge permit provided by the City of Zanesville Wastewater Treatment
Plant. The Director may also develop BMP’s and would be considered local limits
and pretreatment standards.
   (e)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, a SIU may request the Director to convert the limits
to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to
mass limits is within the discretion of the Director. The Director may
establish equivalent mass limits only if the SIU meets the conditions set forth
in 40 CFR 403.6(C)(5). The Director may convert the mass based limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414,419, and 455 to
concentration limits, in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(C)6, for purposes of
calculating limitations applicable to the individual SIU. The determination to
convert mass based limits to concentration limits is at the discretion of the
Director. (Ord. 15-123. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (f)   An application for modification of the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards may be submitted to the USEPA by the Director, when the
City's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the
pollutants as defined by 40 CFR - 403.7. The Director may apply to the USEPA
for allowable variances from categorical Pretreatment Standards for
fundamentally different factors, pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13. The Director may
require any or all dischargers potentially affected by such applications to
provide data, records and other pertinent information necessary for the
preparation and review of the application, subject to the provisions of Section
923.19. (Ord. 84-159. Passed 11-26-84.)
   (g)   The Director may issue specific orders to any industrial user or to
classes of industrial users or may issue general orders to all industrial users
to require compliance with any requirements under this section, including
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, other discharge limits and
reporting requirements. (See Section
923.14)
   (h)   Users may be required by the Director to comply with Best Management
Practices.

the City may issue a wastewater discharge permit.
   (e)   Permit Modifications.
      (1)   The City reserves the right to amend any wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the City with
applicable laws and regulations. All national categorical pretreatment
standards adopted after the promulgation of this section shall without further
action by the City become part of this section upon their effective date. A
discharger with an existing wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the
City within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable national
categorical pretreatment standard, the amended information required by this
chapter. New source dischargers shall submit to the City at least ninety (90)
days prior to commencement of discharge the amended information required by
this chapter. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in this
permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change in such
permit. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable
time scheduled for compliance.
      (2)   The Director may at any time, on its own initiative or in response
to a petition received from an SIU, determine that a non-categorical industrial
user is not a significant industrial user if the industrial user has not
reasonable potential to adversely affect the POTW’s operation in the opinion of
the City or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   Except for the case of centralized waste treatment facilities
regulated by and defined in 40 CFR 437, the Director may authorize a SIU
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the SIU has
demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is
neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only
at background levels from intake water and without increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the SIU. This authorization is subject to the following
conditions:
         A.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         B.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The SIU must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit.
         C.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
SIU must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's processed
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         D.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an
authorized representative of the discharger.
         E.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the U.S. EPA approved method from 40 CFR
Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in
the analysis.
         F.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director must be
included as a condition in the SIU's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the SIU in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Director for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver.
         G.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the SIU's
permit by the Director, the SIU must certify on each report the following
statement, establishing that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the SIU:
   "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the pretreatment standards under 40 CFR specify
applicable national pretreatment standard part or parts, I certify that, to the
best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of
list pollutant or pollutants in the wastewaters due to the activities at the
facility since submittal of the last periodic report under Paragraph (e) of
Rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code”.
         H.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the SIU's operations,
the SIU must immediately notify the Director in writing and start monitoring
that pollutant at the frequency specified by the applicable pretreatment
standard.
         I.   Monitoring waivers do not apply to pollutants where there are
certification processes and requirements established by the Control Authority
or by Categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., TOMP/Certification Alternative
to Total Toxic Organics Monitoring) unless allowed for by the applicable
Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
         J.   This waiver applies only to SIU Self-Monitoring and does not
remove the Director’s obligation to monitor for the parameter. However, this
waiver can be extended to monitoring completed by the Director in order to
satisfy SIU self-monitoring.
   (f)   Permit Duration. New and modified wastewater discharge permits shall
be issued fora specific time period, not to exceed five years. The discharger
shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration
of the existing permit.
   (g)   Compliance schedules.  
      (1)   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities will be required to comply with this section, the discharger shall
provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will
provide such additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional
operational and maintenance activities. The schedule shall contain milestone
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
discharger to comply with the requirements of this chapter or categorical
pretreatment standard including, but not limited to, dates relating to hiring
an engineer, hiring other appropriate personnel, completing preliminary plans,
completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction, start-up of operations, and all other
acts necessary to achieve compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Upon completing final plans all required permits shall be obtained
by the discharger.
   If required by Ohio EPA, a permit to install shall be obtained by the
discharger prior to construction. Final plans shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the discharger and certified to by a qualified engineer who
is a licensed professional.
      (3)   Under no circumstances shall the City permit a time increment in
the compliance schedule for any single step directed toward compliance, which
exceeds nine months.
      (4)   Not later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a
progress report to the City, including no less than a statement as to whether
or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone
date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of
progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to
return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than
nine months elapse between such progress reports to the City.
   (h)   General Wastewater Discharge Permits.
      (1)   The Director may issue a general permit to control SIU discharges
to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered
by a general permit must:
         A.   Have the same or substantially similar types of operations;
         B.   Discharge the same types of wastes;
         C.   Require the same effluent limitations; and
         D.   Require the same or similar monitoring.
         E.   In the opinion of the Director, be more appropriately controlled
under a general permit that under individual wastewater discharge permits.
      (2)   The Director may not issue a general permit for dischargers that
are subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards, categorical
pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or
industrial users whose limits are based on the combined waste stream formula or
net/gross calculations.
      (3)   To be covered by a general control mechanism, the SIU is required
to file a written request for coverage to the Director that identifies:
         A.   SIU’s contact information;
         B.   SIU’s production processes;
         C.   The types of waste generated;
         D.   The location of monitoring all wastes to be covered by the
control mechanism;
         E.   Any requests for a monitoring waiver for any pollutant not
present; and
         F.   Any other information requested by the Director.
      (4)   A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to
be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after
the Director has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request
has been granted in accordance with Section
923.17. The Director shall retain a copy of the general control mechanism,
documentation to support the Director’s determination that a specific SIU meets
the criteria listed above and a copy of the SIU’s written request for coverage
for three (3) years after the expiration of the control mechanism.
         (Ord. 15-123. Passed 11-23-15.)
923.15 REVIEW OF EXTRAORDINARY DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, develop color of
undesirable intensity, form suspended solids in objectionable concentration, or
create any other conditions deleterious to the sewage works, shall be subject
to control or prohibited by the Director.
   (b)   Concentrated dye wastes, spent tanning solution, or other wastes which
are highly colored, or wastes of unusual volume, concentration of solids, or
composition; for example, total suspended solids of inert nature (such as, but
not limited to, Fuller's earth, clay, lime slurries, and lime residues), total
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate) or unusual BOD, COD or chlorine requirements shall be subject to
review by the Director for:
      (1)   Approval or rejection of admission to the public sewers;
      (2)   Modification at the point of origin to permit admission to the
public sewers; or
      (3)   Pretreatment by the person to permit admission to the public
sewers.
   (c)   Any water or wastes containing suspended solids or dissolved solids of
such character and quantity that unusual provisions, attention or expense is
required to handle these solids at the wastewater treatment plant shall be
subject to control or prohibited by the Director.

wastewater discharge permit under Section
923.14, discharger, storm water discharger, person or governmental entity as
required by the Director or his authorized representative shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or
substances established by this section. Detailed plans or new construction
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Director and Building Inspector for review, and shall be
approved by the Director before construction of the facility. Each existing
facility shall complete its plan and submit same to the Director and Building
Inspector as required by the Director. New SIU’s who discharge to the POTW
shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
discharge protection procedures have been submitted and approved by the
Director or his authorized representative. Review and approval of those plans
and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the discharger from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this section.
 
   (b)   A person shall notify the City immediately upon the occurrence of a
slugload or accidental discharge of wastes prohibited by this chapter. The
notification shall include the location of the discharge, date and time, type
of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. A person who
discharges any prohibited liquid or solid waste into a public sewer or natural
outlet shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the sewage works. In
addition, he shall be liable for any fines imposed on the City under State or
Federal law as a result of this discharge. Each such discharge and each day on
which there continues to be a discharge shall be considered separate violations
and the penalties and costs shall be levied accordingly. Such penalties and
costs shall be collected by the City in the same manner as all other charges
set by the City.
   (c)   Any person who is unintentionally and temporarily in a state of
noncompliance with this chapter due to factors beyond his reasonable control
shall inform the City, within twenty-four hours of the commencement of the
operating upset. Where information is given orally, the person shall file a
written follow-up report with the City within five days. The report shall:
      (1)   Describe the incident, its cause and its impact on the person's
compliance status;
      (2)   Give the duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
of noncompliance. If the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the conditions of noncompliance.
   A documented and verified operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to
any enforcement action brought by the City against a discharger for
noncompliance with the chapter.
   (d)   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
person's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slugload,
accidental discharge or operating upset. Any employee who may cause or discover
such a discharge shall be given instruction in emergency notification
procedures.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
   (e)   The Director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and

address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of stored chemicals; and
      (2)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental
or slug discharge, as required by subsection (b) hereof; and
      (3)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental spills or
slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency

923.17 INDUSTRIAL USERS, REPORTS AND COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES.
   (a)   All industrial users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards and
any other industrial user as required by the Director shall not discharge
wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit
from the Director as required in Section
923.14. These industrial users shall submit a baseline monitoring report to
determine acceptability of discharge and compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. Industrial users subject to a newly
promulgated Categorical Pretreatment Standard shall submit this report within
180 days following the effective date of such a standard. New source
dischargers shall submit a baseline report at least ninety days prior to
discharging to the POTW. For new source industries, the Director may allow
estimates of production rates, discharge volumes and pollutant concentrations.
The information on this report shall be current and shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   A list of any environmental control permits held by the facility.
      (3)   A description of operations, including the nature, rate of
production and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of the operation(s).
This description shall include a schematic process diagram which indicates the
point(s) of discharge to the POTW.
      (4)   Measured average daily and maximum flows of regulated process
streams and other nonregulated streams.
      (5)   Results of sampling and analysis of regulated pollutants from each
regulated process. Except as indicated in subsection (a)(5)A. hereof, the user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Director
may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4)
grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition. grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Samples should be taken immediately downstream of pretreatment facilities if
such exist or immediately downstream of regulated processes if no pretreatment
facilities exist. All samples shall be representative of daily operations.
         A.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, hexavalent chromium, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques and composited in a laboratory.
         B.   Except for those pollutants that are required to be measured by
grab samples (referenced above), all other pollutants will be measured by flow-
proportional sampling unless justification for an alternate sampling type,
representative of the discharge, is documented in the industrial user file.
         C.   Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period
may now be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for hexavalent
chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may now be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil &
grease the samples may now be composited in the laboratory. Protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. 136 and appropriate
U.S. EPA guidance must be followed.
         D.   The Director may require an industrial user to install flow
monitoring facilities, instruments, and recording devices to enable accurate
measurement of flows as determined to be necessary.
         E.   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis
conducted by City in lieu of the industrial user, the City will perform the
repeat sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
         F.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the Discharger's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a Discharger to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the Discharger to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
         G.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based
on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report. based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (5.5)   Effluent limits, including Best Management Practices, based on
applicable pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Raw materials utilized and their amount.
      (7)   Type and amount of product produced. For industrial users subject
to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Director, this
report shall include a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production
rate. For industrial users subject to production based standards, this report
shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period.
      (7.5)   When determined to be necessary by the Director, submit
documentation indicating compliance with BMP’s.
      (8)   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities will be required to comply with this section, the discharger shall
provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will
provide such additional pretreatment according to the conditions in Section

this section or ninety days following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the sewage system by a new discharger, any discharger subject
to this section shall submit to the City a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. In cases where the
wastewater discharge permit requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice, the discharger must submit documentation required by the Director or
the wastewater discharge permit necessary to determine the compliance status of
the discharger. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operations and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, and this statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the discharger.
   (c)   An industrial user, as required by its discharge order, shall submit
to the Director during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by the Director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
the regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by Pretreatment
Standards. The Director, for extenuating circumstances, may authorize the
submission of the reports on months other than those specified herein.
   Each report shall include an accurate record of flows, including minimums,
averages and maximums, during the period based on actual measurements. The
Director may waive the requirements for actual flow measurement if reliable

924.03 USE OF FUNDS.
   (a)   The funds received from the collection of the charges or rentals
authorized by this chapter shall be deposited with the City Treasury and shall
be accounted for and shall be known as the Sanitary Sewer Fund, and subject to
the provisions of any ordinance or indenture of mortgage authorizing the
issuance of and securing mortgage revenue bonds for the sanitary sewerage
system of the City, when appropriated by Council, shall be available for the
payment of the cost and expense of the management, maintenance and repair of
the City sanitary sewerage system and the sewage pumping, treatment and
disposal works. Any surplus in such fund shall be used for the payment of the
interest on bonds issued and outstanding or which may be issued to provide
funds with which to pay the City's portion of the cost of construction of such
sanitary sewerage system, or parts thereof, and such sewage pumping, treatment
and disposal works and to retire such bonds when they mature, and/or for the
enlargement or replacement of such sanitary sewerage system, pumping, treatment
and disposal works, or for the creation of a sinking fund for payment of such
debt.
 
   (b)   A replacement fund shall be established to provide funds for expenses
required to furnish and install equipment, accessories or appurtenances
necessary to maintain the capacity and performance of the treatment works.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82; Ord. 91-32. Passed 3-11-91.)
 
924.04  CHARGES A LIEN; CERTIFICATION TO COUNTY AUDITOR.
   Each charge or rate levied by or pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a
lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the
sanitary sewage system of the City. If the same is not paid within thirty days
after it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the County Auditor
who shall place the same on the tax duplicate of the County with the interest
and penalties allowed by law and be collected as other taxes are collected.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.05  ANNUAL AUDIT OF SEWER FUND.
   (a)   The City Auditor shall prepare an annual audit of the Sewer Fund which
will be submitted to the State Auditor as a part of the "Report of Receipts and
Expenditures" required by Ohio R.C. 117.06.
 
   (b)   An annual audit shall be performed by the City Auditor of the Sewer
Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Budget for determination of sewer rates.
Adjustments shall be made as necessary.
(Ord. 91-32. Passed 3-11-91.)
 
924.06  SEWER SERVICE CHARGES DEFINED.
   (a)   Every person having access to or who discharges sanitary sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other wastes, either directly or indirectly into
the sewage works under the jurisdiction of the City, shall be charged for the
use of these works and for the treatment of their sewage.
 
   (b)   The sewer service charges shall consist of the base charge, volume
charge, strength surcharge, and industrial waste surveillance charge as
follows:
      (1)   Base charge.  The flat rate fee charged to each account which
covers the first 300 cubic feet of sewage used per billing period.
      (2)   Volume charge.  The service charge based on the volume of standard
strength sewage in excess of the first 300 cubic feet of sewage and charged to
all accounts in addition to the base charge. Standard strength sewage shall
include maximum strength as follows:
 
mg/l
A.   BOD (5 day)   200
B.   COD   400
C.   Suspended solids250
 
      (3)   Strength surcharge. The charge based on the pounds of chemical
oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids in excess of the
amount in standard strength sewage and charged to all industrial accounts in
addition to all other charges. The strength surcharge shall be based on the
cost of treating the excess quantities of waste measured in 100 pound units.
      (4)   Industrial waste surveillance charge. The industrial waste
surveillance charge is a flat rate fee charged to each industrial user for
months during which the City has analyzed his waste discharge. This fee,
assessed in addition to all other charges, shall be utilized to defray up to
one-half the cost of monitoring and analyzing point source discharges. The
remainder of the cost is incorporated into the volume charge for industrial
users.
 
   (c)   A separate account shall be established for each meter used to
establish volumes of sewage flow.
 
   (d)   Monthly and Bimonthly Accounts.
      (1)   All domestic users shall be classified as bimonthly accounts.
      (2)   All industrial users shall be classified as monthly accounts.
      (3)   All commercial users contributing an average of less than 5,000
cubic feet per month shall be classified as bimonthly accounts.
      (4)   All commercial users contributing an average of 5,000 cubic feet or
more per month shall be classified as monthly accounts.
         (Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.07  SEWER USER CLASSIFICATION.
   The classes of users shall be as follows:
   (a)   "Domestic class" shall include all single or multiple unit residential
accounts with domestic type wastewater only. A residence which includes a
commercial establishment shall be considered a domestic account if the
wastewater produced is primarily domestic in nature and the flow contributed by
the commercial activities of the establishment is a secondary flow of the sewer
connection and does not exceed the standards for standard strength wastewater.
   (b)   "Commercial class" shall include all nonresidential accounts that are
not required to be in the industrial class. Transient residences shall be
commercial accounts.
   (c)   "Industrial class" shall include all users who discharge to the City's
wastewater disposal system liquid wastes resulting from the processes employed
in industry or manufacturing, or from the development of any natural resource
and any user whose average wastewater strength exceeds one and one-half times
normal domestic sewage strengths in any of the parameters listed in
924.06(b)(2).
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.08 MEASUREMENT OF SEWAGE VOLUME AND STRENGTH.
   (a)   Determination of the Volume of Waste Discharged. In order to determine
the volume and concentration of waste discharged by any person for the purpose
of determining applicable sanitary sewage rate or industrial waste rate, the
City may use as the figure representing the number of cubic feet of sewage or
waste discharged into the sewerage system:
      (1)   The amount of water supplied to the premises as measured by a water
meter acceptable to the Director, there in use;
      (2)   The number of cubic feet of sewage discharged into the sewerage
system as determined by measurements taken by a sewage meter at a control
manhole, all installed by the owner, at the owner's expense;
      (3)   A figure determined by any combination of the foregoing; or
      (4)   By any reasonable method determined by the Director in certain
unusual circumstances where use of meters is not practicable.
 
   (b)   Analysis for Application of Industrial Waste Charges.
      (1)   In order to determine the proper industrial waste charges, the City
shall request all users classified as industrial waste users, to submit an
analysis of their discharge showing a determination of the concentration of
wastes contained in such discharge. Such analysis shall include all information
requested on forms provided therefor by the City.
      (2)   After the initial determination by the City, the City may from time
to time request a repeat analysis of any industrial waste user in order to
ensure the accuracy of the industrial waste charges.
 
   (c)   Validation of Analysis by City.  The City shall have the right to make
its own analysis of the user's discharge in order to validate the analysis
submitted by such user. Such analytical data and samples shall be made
available to the user. The cost of monitoring, analyzing and validating a
user's discharge shall be reimbursed to the City by the user in accordance with
Chapter
925.
 
   (d)   Special Charges for Industrial Wastes. The City may impose special
charges over and above the industrial waste rate if a particular waste causes
additional expense to the City in its handling and treatment. To determine
acceptability of any such waste and the charge for treatment thereof, the City
shall require persons wishing to discharge such wastes to submit a written
analysis of the characteristics of the wastes. Such analysis may be validated
by the City as provided for in subsection (c) hereof.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.09 DETERMINATION OF EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGE.
   (a)   The standard strengths for biochemical oxygen demand and suspended
solids, as shown in Section
924.06 shall be subtracted from the average strengths, as determined in Section
924.08, to determine the extra strengths of each industrial class user for each
strength surcharge billing period. The extra strengths and the volume of sewage
charged for the billing period shall then be used to determine the weight in
pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) to be
charged for strength surcharge. The BOD surcharge shall be based on pounds of
BOD or 0.5 times the pounds of chemical oxygen demand, whichever is greater.
 
   (b)   For use in determining the BOD and SS concentrations, an average will
be used which will be established from a minimum of two tests per month taken
on composite samples.
 
   (c)   The charges for handling those wastes exceeding the limits set forth
above shall be based on the following formula:
 
 
Cs=(Bc x B + Sc x S) Vu x 8.345
Cs=surcharge
Bc=unit cost for BOD (see Chapter
925 for rate)
B=concentration of BOD (exceeding base of 200 mg/l)
Sc=unit cost for suspended solids (see Chapter
925 for rate)
S=concentration of suspended solids (exceeding base of 250 mg/l)
Vu=total volume of flow in million gallons 8.345=constant of proportionality
 
   (d)   The charges calculated from the rate structure for any billing period
plus the cost of surcharge as calculated in subsection (c) hereof, will be the
charge made to that customer for that billing period.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.10 INDUSTRIAL WASTE TESTING.
   (a)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for Examination of Water
and Wastewater.
 
   (b)   The strength of the wastes shall be determined from samples taken at
the control manhole at any period of time or duration, and in any manner the
Director may elect. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer from the point at which the sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effects of the
wastes upon the sewerage system and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.11 SPECIAL CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS.
   (a)   Connections Involving Invalid Assessment; Payment of Assessment Prior
to Permit. Where public sewers have been constructed and the cost thereof has
been wholly or partly paid out of the funds of the City, or financed through
the issuance of bonds, and the owner of any property abutting upon such sewers
makes application to tap such sewers, no permit shall be issued to such
abutting property owner to make such connection unless he shall have first paid
that portion of the cost of such sewers which the property of such owner for
which a connection is desired to be made, was formerly charged in the form of
an assessment, but which assessment the City has been unable to collect due to
defects in procedure or the failure to obtain an assessment lien for such cost.
However, where a portion of the cost of such sewers to which connections are
desired to be made has been assessed against such abutting property and a valid
assessment lien imposed thereon for such cost, or where, in the case of an
invalid assessment, reassessment for such cost may be levied under and by
authority of Ohio R.C. 727.39, such permit shall be issued, provided the same
conforms with the other regulations of the City.
 
   (b)   Connections Involving No Assessments, Specific Areas and Manufacturing
Establishments. The Director may, upon written request, grant permits, as he
may deem proper, allowing persons to tap the public sewers which were
constructed by the City without the levy of a special assessment, for which
such persons shall be charged, except as hereinafter provided, a fee as
specified by the Director for each front foot of lot or tract of land within
the City, and a fee as specified by the Director for each front foot of a lot
or tract of land outside the City, which is to be connected with and to be
drained.
   For the privilege of tapping the storm and sanitary sewer extending on each
side of Main Street, from Ninth Street to Second Street, from Main Street to
Market Street, each person shall be charged a fee as specified by the Director
for each front foot of the land or tract of land so to be connected with and
drained by such sewer.
   The permit shall be issued by the Director under rules prescribed by him,
and the charges therefor shall be paid at the time of issuance. The price shall
not apply to and include persons who have been assessed according to law for
the construction of a sewer to be tapped, and who have paid such assessment,
they being entitled to such connections without further charge. However, the
owner or tenant for whose benefit a connection is made shall, in consideration
of the privilege thereby granted and enjoyed, hold the City harmless from any
loss or damage that may in any way result from and be occasioned by such
tapping or connection.
When it is desired to tap public sewers for connecting manufacturing
establishments situated in or adjacent to the City, the charge for each tap to
such manufacturing establishments shall be established by the Director.
 
   (c)   Connections Involving Exempt Assessments Claimed by Owner. When any
street or alley is improved by the construction of a sanitary sewer therein and
any property abutting thereon is held as exempt from assessment for the cost of
the construction of such sewer by reason of the claim by the owners thereof
that such property is already provided with adequate sewerage and local
drainage, in the event thereafter the owners or occupants of such premises
shall make application to tap such sewer, the price to be charged for tapping
shall be the same amount per front foot as the original cost price per front
foot assessed against the owner of property abutting such sewer.
 
   (d)   Residential Capacity Fee. In those cases where an interceptor runs
through or adjacent to any residential properties and a Y branch has heretofore
been installed in such interceptor sewer for future connection, the owner of
the property for which such Y branch was constructed may presently tap into
such interceptor sewer through the Y branch so constructed. For the privilege
of tapping and using an interceptor sewer under the conditions described
herein, each residential property owner shall pay a sum of one thousand five
hundred seventy dollars ($1,570) per equivalent dwelling unit of 250 gallons
per day per house. However, in those cases where the property lies in an area
where a lateral or service sewer has been installed, or for the installation of
which a resolution of necessity has been passed and the service sewers are in
the process of being installed, then such fee will be based on the assessment
charged in the area for each unit benefited on the service or lateral sewer.
Such payment shall be deposited to the benefit of the Sewage Revenue Fund
account, or to the Construction Fund for the service sewers being constructed
where such is the case.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
   (e)   Commercial or Industrial Capacity Fee.
      (1)    For the purpose of tapping into such Y branches already provided
and using interceptor sewers for the disposal of sanitary sewage, each
commercial, industrial and special type property owner shall pay, in addition
to charges customarily made, a sum to be determined by the Division of
Engineering and Construction of the City, based on uniform standards, such sum
to be not less than one thousand five hundred seventy dollars ($1,570) and
shall be based on the equivalent dwelling units of 250 gallons per day (gpd)
per unit. Industry would require consideration on a case by case basis and
would consider one Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) as not only the flow of 250
gpd but also the wastewater strength of 200 mg/I Biochemical Oxygen Demand
(BOD) and 250 mg/I Suspended Solids (SS). Therefore, one EDU would equal 0.417
pounds of BOD and 0.521 pounds of SS. Such sum shall be deposited to the
benefit of the Sewage Revenue Fund account, or to the Construction Fund for the
service sewers being constructed, where such is the case.
      (2)    Credits for existing sewer service capacity fees can be provided
for redevelopment and change in use when there is a requested increase in
capacity use only on the specific property. Such credit will be given when
increasing the equivalent dwelling units.
         In determining the credit, the customer's existing capacity shall be
compared to their proposed (expanded) capacity (e.g. equivalent dwelling
units). Existing capacity for purposes of valuing the credit shall be
established at the City's then current value of the amount of capacity at the
time of the application for credit. The difference between the value of the
full (requested) capacity and the redevelopment capacity credit shall be paid
to the City at the current rate.
         Capacity credits shall be provided to a customer that is properly and
legally connected to the sewer system, even if no sewer capacity fees had been
previously paid for the property. The customer's existing capacity for purposes
of establishing a redevelopment (capacity) credit shall be the lesser of the
current value of capacity at the time of the application for credit or the
value of capacity documented in a previously executed agreement between the
City and the customer. When the previous capacity is undocumented to the city
or the current property owner, the Public Service Director is given the
authority to establish the previous capacity based on historic data for the
property.
         Refunds or credits for existing water and sewer service capacity fees
will not be given when reducing the equivalent dwelling units loading. The
original capacity shall remain with the property and available for use.
Capacity and capacity (fee) credits shall remain with the property only and are
non-transferable to any other property.
         (Ord. 19-143. Passed 1-13-20; Ord. 2024-112. Passed 8-12-24.)
 
   (f)   Permits and Charges for Trailer Camp Connections. No connection shall
be made with any public sewer or drain by any private sewers or sewer systems
located on the premises of a trailer camp or trailer park, which sewers or
sewer systems are serving the trailers located therein, without written permit
from the Director. Any connection or opening made into any public sewer or
drain without such permit or in a manner different from the mode herein
prescribed shall be a misdemeanor. Each and every day that any person shall,
without such permit, continue to use and drain into the public sewer shall be
considered a separate and distinct offense.
   The Director may, upon written request, grant permits, as he may deem
proper, allowing persons owning or operating a trailer camp or trailer park to
tap the public sewers for connection therewith, for which such persons shall be
charged as hereinafter provided.
   For each and every trailer connected, or which may be connected in the
future, to the private sewer system which in turn is connected with the public
sewers of the City, a charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) per trailer shall be
made.
 
   (g)   Nonliability of City. The owner for whose benefit a sewer connection
is made shall, in consideration of the privilege thereby granted and enjoyed,
hold the City harmless from any loss or damage that may in any way result from
and be occasioned by such tapping or connections.
 
   (h)   Charge Designation and Payment. The charges provided for in subsection
(d) and (e) hereof shall be designated special sewage service charges, and
shall be paid in full at the time the application for a tap is approved.
 
   (i)   Application for Sewer Permit; Industrial Waste.
      (1)   Application for a sewer permit for any new or revised service to
establishments producing industrial wastes shall be made by the owner or his
agent to the Director on a special form furnished by the City. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other
information considered pertinent by the Director. Upon approval of the
application by the Director, a permit and inspection fee of seventy-five
dollars ($75.00) shall be paid to the City.
      (2)   All costs charged by the City's consulting sanitary engineer to
review plans and specifications shall be borne by the applicant and a deposit
for such service of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be paid to the City at
the time of application. Any additional charges or refund will be made at the
time the application is approved and the permit is issued. This plan review
charge shall be in addition to the permit and inspection fee described in
subsection (i)(1) hereof. (Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
   (j)   Treatment Charges for Holding Tank Waste (Residential).  A charge of
twenty- five dollars ($25.00) per truck plus five cents (5¢) per gallon or a
minimum of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per 2,000 gallons.
   In addition, a minimum chlorine surcharge of $.004 per gallon will be
assessed to all haulers. This surcharge may be adjusted from time to time by
the Director of Public Service depending on the cost of chlorine to the City.
(Ord. 90-31. Passed 3-26-90; Ord. 90-53. Passed 5-14-90; Ord. 06-69. Passed 7-
10-06; Ord. 10-78. Passed 10-25-10.)
   (k)   Treatment Charges for Other Wastes (Commercial). Treatment charges for
other waste (commercial and industrial); a charge of twenty-five dollars
($25.00) per truck plus ten cents (10¢) per gallon or a minimum charge of two
hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) and 2,000 gallons, and if receiving fats,
oil, or grease a charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per truck plus twenty
cents (20¢) per gallons shall be required.
   In addition, a minium chlorine surcharge of $.004 per gallon will be
assessed to all haulers. This surcharge may be adjusted from time to time by
the Director of Public Service depending on the cost of chlorine to the City.
   The commercial rate for a single source waste generator shall be ten cents
($0.10) per gallon for zero to 500,000 gallons and five cents ($0.05) per
gallon for 500,001 + gallons.
(Ord. 2020-33. Passed 3-23-20.)
 
   (l)   Testing Requirements for Scavenger Septic Haulers. A pH analysis is
required prior to dumping of each load for all domestic, commercial and
industrial haulers.
   An oil & grease is required once per month for all domestic, commercial and
industrial haulers.
   Commercial and industrial haulers are required to have a minimum of one
metals analysis per month. In addition, industrial haulers are required to have
three BOD and SS analyses per month for calculation of strength surcharges.
   All haulers are subject to the pH, oil & grease and metals limitations as
defined in Chapter
923. The City reserves the right to refuse any hauler who fails to meet these
limitations. In addition, all haulers must have a discharge permit as stated in
Section
923.04(a).
   All laboratory costs incurred by the City shall be charged to the septic
haulers in accordance with the fees determined and published by the Director.
 
   (m)   Pass-back Costs for Industrial Users. The Director of Public Service
shall periodically compute and publish actual costs incurred by the City for
the various laboratory tests, the cost of issuing discharge orders, the cost of
inspections and the costs of sampling and flow monitoring required for
industrial users. The Director of Public Service shall by regulation establish
a procedure for collecting any such pass-back costs from the industrial users.
(Ord. 90-31. Passed 3-26-90.)
 
924.12  LICENSING SEWER TAPPERS AND BUILDERS.
   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall engage in the business of sewer
tapping or sewer building, or open or tap any sewer in any street, alley or
public or private place within the City without first obtaining a license to
engage in such business. However, the provisions of this chapter shall not
apply to the regular employees of manufacturing establishments, which are
subject to inspection by representatives of the state under the provisions of
the Ohio Revised Code, doing sewer work on factory owned premises.
 
   (b)   Whoever desires to conduct, carry on or engage in the business of
sewer tapping or sewer building shall make application to the Director. If
satisfied of the competency of an applicant, the Director may issue a license
authorizing the applicant to conduct, carry on or engage in the business of
sewer tapping sewer and/or building.
 
   (c)   For a sewer tapper and/or sewer builder's license, the fee on original
application shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00), and on the yearly renewal
thereof, the fee will be fifteen dollars ($15.00).
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.13  SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any person whereby a
waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for
treatment, subject to payment by the person.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.14 CONTRACTS WITH POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS AND INDUSTRIES.
   The Director is authorized to negotiate a contract, subject to final
approval by Council, with each benefited political subdivision and industry
connected, or to be connected, to the City's sewerage system for the treatment
and disposal of its sewage and industrial wastes. Such contracts shall be based
on the same conditions and charges as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
 
924.15 REVIEW OF CHARGES AND FEES.
   Annually, by September 1, the Director shall prepare an updated capital
improvements schedule and a recommended schedule of service charges. He shall
submit the sewer service charge schedule at the first regular Council meeting
thereafter for ratification and incorporation into the City ordinances. The
schedule shall be in accordance with the following requirements:
   (a)   The schedule shall result in the distribution of the costs of
operation and maintenance of the treatment works within the City's jurisdiction
to each user class in proportion to the user's contribution to the total
wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance costs, including replacement, to each user's class.
      (Ord. 82-211. Passed 12-13-82.)
   (b)   The schedule shall be reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to
reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs. The schedule
shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs of all treatment works
operation and maintenance and debt service.
   The Director shall notify each customer annually as to the actual costs of
the rates are attributed to operation, maintenance, replacement and debt
service.
(Ord. 91-32. Passed 3-11-91.)

927.02 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL; CONSTRUCTION AND POST- CONSTRUCTION STORM
WATER CONTROL.
   (a)    Purpose and Scope.
      (1)    The purpose of Section
927.02 is to establish technically feasible and economically reasonable
standards to achieve a level of erosion and sediment control that will minimize
damage to property and degradation of water resources and wetlands, and will
promote and maintain the health and safety of the citizens of the City.
      (2)    This section will:
         A.    Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
         B.    Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and
wetlands that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   (b)    Regulated Activities. Section
927.02 applies to all regulated discharges outlined in the eligibility section
of the most recent version of the Ohio EPA General Construction Storm
Water Permit.
   (c)    Application Procedures.
      (1)    Applicants must submit the following documentation to the
permitting authority prior to construction:
         A.    An Ohio EPA General Construction Storm Water Permit notice of
intent form.
         B.    Site location map.
         C.    Two copies of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3).
One copy of the approved SWP3 will be returned to the applicant.
         D.    A General Storm Water Drainage Permit as defined in Section
928.05. 
      (2)    Criteria for the listed documentation must be the same as outlined
in the most current Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National
Pollution Discharge Elimination (NPDES) General Storm Water Permit for
Construction Activities. Within 30 calendar days of the receipt of all
documentation, the permitting authority shall approve or disapprove the
application for a sediment erosion control permit. A statement of disapproval
shall include the reason therefore and shall identify the deficiencies in the
documentation and shall state the procedures for filing a revised plan. Upon
receipt of revised documentation, the plan reviewer shall respond with approval
or disapproval within 30 calendar days. Once final approval has been made and a
permit issued, any subsequent changes shall be approved in writing by the
authorized agency.
      (3)    The permittee must also obtain coverage under the Ohio EPA General
Construction Storm Water Permit before earth disturbance begins. A copy of the
Ohio EPA coverage letter shall be mailed to the MS4 permitting authority as
evidence of coverage. If the operator of a project fails to obtain Ohio EPA
General Construction Storm Water Permit coverage the project will be considered
an illicit discharge.
   (d)    Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. The applicant shall submit a
Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) consistent with the requirements
set forth in the most recent Ohio EPA NPDES General Construction Permit. For
specific requirements of an SWP3, the designer shall refer to SWP3 check list.
The SWP3 must address erosion and sediment control during construction as well
as post-construction practices. Post-construction practices must meet the
requirements of the most recent Ohio EPA General Construction Storm Water
Permit. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures as recommended by the most current
edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual as published by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.
      (1)    Non-structural post-construction water quality practices. Non-
structural post-construction best management practices include preservation,
planning, or procedures that direct development away from water resources or
limit creation of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation
easements, riparian and wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design
are all non-structural controls.
         A.    All non-structural water quality practices must be protected
from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
         B.    All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must be clearly shown and described on the current deed for
the subject property and recorded in the Muskingum County, Ohio Recorder's
office and be disclosed to potential buyers.
      (2)    Structural water quality practices. Structural post-construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
         A.    All structural water quality practices must be established prior
to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
         B.    Maintenance. The post-construction water quality practice must
be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the
Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
   (e)    Compliance with Local, State, and Federal Regulations. All submittals
are required to show proof of compliance with all state and federal
regulations. Approvals issued in accordance with this subchapter do not relieve
the applicant of responsibility for obtaining all other necessary permits and/
or approvals from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other
federal, state, and/or county agencies, if requirements vary, the most
restrictive requirement shall prevail. These permits may include, but are not
limited to, those listed below:
      (1)    Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of the Ohio EPA Water Quality Certification application tracking number,
public notice, or approval letter.

927.03  ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION ELIMINATION.
   (a)    Purpose/Intent. The purpose of Section
927.03 is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City of Zanesville through the regulation of non-storm water
discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as
required by federal, state and local law. This subchapter establishes methods
for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives
of this subchapter are:
      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the (MS4) by storm
water discharges by any user.
      (2)    To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
      (3)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
subchapter.
   (b)    Applicability. This subchapter shall apply to all water entering the
MS4 generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted
by an authorized enforcement agency.
   (c)    Discharge Prohibitions.
      (1)    Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
         A.    Waterline flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration ("infiltration"
is defined as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system, including
sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the ground, through such
means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes. "Infiltration"
does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains; air
conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities.
Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being
necessary to protect public health and safety. Dye testing is an allowable
discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement
agency prior to the time of the test. The prohibition shall not apply to any
non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
      (2)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
         A.    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
         B.    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
         C.    A person is considered to be in violation of this subchapter if
the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
   (d)    Suspension of MS4 Access.
      (1)    Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Public Service Director or Designee may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (2)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have his or her MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
      (3)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this subchapter, without the prior approval of
the authorized enforcement agency.
   (e)    Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges. Any person subject to
an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit
may be required in a form acceptable to the Public Service Director or Designee
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
   (f)    Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants by
the Use of Best Management Practices. The Public Service Director or Designee
will require best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility
which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the
MS4, or waters of the state. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-
structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with Section
 927.03, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this subchapter. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
   (g)   Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part
of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other
obstacles that would pollute and contaminate. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (h)   Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system,
or water of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than
the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the Public Service Director or
Designee within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

sections dealing with each type of application.
      (4)    Joint hearings. When an application requires action by two or more
City Planning Review Boards, excluding City Council, a joint public hearing may
be held. The intent of the joint hearing is to allow members of the different
Boards to hear relevant testimony, to participate in discussions on the

involved.
   The Chairman of the Board having initial jurisdiction on the application
shall chair the joint hearing. Each Board shall operate according to their
respective provisions as provided in this Zoning Code. A separate "notice of
decision" and appropriate "certificate" and/or "permit" shall be issued by each
Board.
 
   (b)   Public Notice. The requirements for public notice herein shall be
complied with for any zoning action that requires a hearing.

objector to any petition requiring a hearing shall notify the petitioner that
he or she has been so retained and shall file an objection at the hearing. Such
notice shall be delivered no later than four days before the scheduled date of
the hearing. If such notice has not been given, and the petitioner so requests;
the body conducting the hearing may reschedule the hearing.
 
   (d)   Public Hearing, Subpoenas and Witnesses.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a complete and accurate application, no later than
by the filing deadline established by the Department, for a zoning action
requiring a hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall transmit the application to
the next regularly scheduled Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals,
Design Review Board or Council meeting as provided herein, which shall hold a
hearing on the application.
      (2)   Applicants shall have the right to have subpoenas issued by the

President of Council.
 
   (e)   Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, Historic Preservation
Board or Downtown Design Review Board.  The Planning Commission, Board of

petitioner approves any further postponement.
   Within ten days after the close of the public hearing, the Secretary to the
Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, Historic Preservation Board or
Downtown Design Review Board shall prepare a report consisting of written
findings of fact pertaining to the approval criteria provided herein for the
applicable zoning action together with an action on the application, passed by
a majority vote of its members, and any conditions or restrictions to which the
action is to be subject. The report shall include the roll call vote on the
action.
   The action taken by the Planning Commission shall be in the form of a
recommendation for final action by Council. The action taken by the Board of

the action may include any modification of normal requirements that is
authorized by this Code.

   The Planning Commission shall transmit to Council its report within ten days
after the close of the informal hearing held by the Commission. Council shall
act upon applications heard by the Commission (amendments and conditional use
approval of planned unit developments) but not upon applications decided by the
Board of Zoning Appeals or Design Review Board. It shall not act upon any
application requiring a public hearing until either it has received a report
thereupon from the Planning Commission or until ten days have elapsed from the
close of the informal hearing held by the Commission thereupon.
   Council shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the provisions on
hearing process herein except for public notice. Council shall give at least
thirty days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing in a newspaper of

and adjacent roadway system (functional classification, lanes, speed limits,
etc.). This description shall include surrounding land uses, expected
development in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions,
special site features and a description of any planned roadway improvements.
The study shall define and justify the study area selected for analysis.
      (b)    Description of the Proposed Development. A description of factors
such as the number and types of dwelling units, the gross and usable floor
area, the number of employees, and shift change factors. Intended phasing or
future expansion shall also be noted.
      (c)    Description of Existing Traffic Conditions. Existing conditions
including existing peak hour traffic volumes (and daily volumes if applicable)
on street(s) adjacent to the site. Existing counts and levels of service for
intersections in the vicinity, which are expected to be impacted, shall be
provided. Traffic count date shall not be more than two (2) years old.
      (d)    Roadway Characteristics Shall Be Described and Illustrated, as
Appropriate. Features to be addressed include land configurations, geometries,
signal timing, traffic control devices, posted speed limits, average running
speeds, and any sight distance limitations. Existing levels of service shall be
calculated for intersections included within the study area. The existing right
of way shall be identified along with any planned expansion of the right of
way. Existing driveways and potential turning movement conflicts in the
vicinity of the site shall be illustrated and described.

Impact Study with a construction completion date beyond one (1) year at the
time of the traffic study, the analysis shall also include a scenario analyzing
forecast traffic at date of construction completion.
       (f)    Trip Generation. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed
development for the a.m. (if applicable) and p.m. peak hour and average day
shall be calculated. This forecast shall be based on the data and procedures
outlined in the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE).
      (g)    Phased Projects.  For projects intended to be developed in phases,
the trip generation by phase shall be described.
       (h)    Methodology.  A description of the application of standard
engineering procedures for determining the distribution shall be attached (trip

shall be provided. Before and after capacity analyses shall be performed for
all street intersections where the expected traffic generated at the site will
comprise at least five percent (5%) of the existing intersection capacity.
       (j)    Access Design/Access Management Standards. The study shall
include a map and description of the location and design of proposed access
(driveways or new street intersections) including: any sight distance
limitations, dimensions from adjacent driveways and intersections within a
minimum of two hundred fifty feet (250 ft.) on either side of the main roadway,
data to demonstrate that the number of driveways proposed is the fewest
necessary, and support that the access points will provide safe and efficient
traffic operation.

1115.01 PURPOSE.
   Because of special characteristics of particular properties in the City, the
literal application of the provisions of this Zoning Code may in certain
instances create hardships not intended by these regulations. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may accordingly grant variances from the literal application of
the provisions of this Code based on findings of fact as provided in this
chapter. Variances herein shall be considered the same as variations under the
Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.02 APPROVAL PROCESS.
   Variances shall be approved only in conformance with the approval process
provided in
Chapter
1113 and the approval criteria in Table 4, Section
1115.06. Minor variances may be reviewed and approved by the Planning and
Zoning Administrator or referred to the Board of Zoning Appeals for cause.
(Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.03 APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR USE VARIANCES.
   A use variance allows for a use to occur on property that is not permitted
within the zoning district the property is located in. Use variances are
specific and substantial thus they require special conditions the Board must
consider when making a decision. In granting approval or conditional approval
of a use variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall prepare written findings
of fact that the majority of the conditions below apply to the application.
   (1)    The property cannot be put to any economically viable and appropriate
use under any of the permitted uses in the zoning district;
   (2)    The Variance requested stems from conditions that are particular to
the subject property and are not applicable, generally, to other properties
within the same zoning classification;
   (3)    The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
   (4)    Granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent property owners or residents;
   (5)    Granting of the variance will not adversely affect the community
character, public health, safety or general welfare;
   (6)    The Variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of
the Zoning Code;
   (7)    The Variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant;
   (8)    The applicant's predicament feasibly cannot be resolved through some
method other than a variance; and
   (9)    Granting of a variance would not adversely affect the delivery of
government services. (Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.04 MINOR VARIANCES.
   The purpose of minor variance procedures is to reduce the time and expense
to applicants
obtaining approval of simple variances that are likely to have minimal adverse
impact.
   The fee owner, contract purchaser or option holder of one parcel or lot that
wishes to request a variance for that property may apply under minor variance
procedures.
   Filing submissions shall be as determined on a case-by-case basis by the
Planning and Zoning Administrator and may be less than required for other
variances in Table 1, Section
1113.13. The Planning and Zoning Administrator may refer any Minor variance to
the Board of Zoning Appeals for cause. Minor variance procedures shall not
apply to an application involving more than one residential dwelling or more
than one commercial parcel. The applicant has the right to appeal a Minor
Variance decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.05 EXISTING VARIANCES.
   Any lawful variance previously granted to any lawful use existing on the
date of adoption of this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto that requires a
variance under such Code or amendment, shall be considered a lawful variance
without the need for approval of a variance hereunder.
(Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.06 TABLE 4: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR AREA VARIANCES.
   In granting approval or conditional approval of an area variance, the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall prepare written findings of fact that the majority of
the conditions below apply to the application:
   1.    Special Circumstances Not Found Elsewhere. Special circumstances,
fully described in the written findings, exist that are peculiar to the
property for which the variance is sought and that do not apply generally to
other properties in the same zoning district. And these circumstances are not
of so general or recurrent a nature as to make it reasonably practical to
provide, in the form of an amendment to this Code, a general regulation to
cover them.
   2.    Circumstances Relate to the Property Only. Since a variance will
affect the character of its surroundings long after a property changes hands,
the special circumstances referenced herein relate only to the physical
character of the land or building( s) for which a variance is sought, such as
dimensions, topography or soil conditions. They do not concern any business or
activity the present or prospective owner or tenant carries on, or seeks to
carry on, therein, nor to the personal, business or financial circumstances of
such owner or tenant or any other party with interest in the property.
   3.    Unnecessary Hardship. For reasons fully set forth in the written
findings, the literal application of the provisions of this Zoning Code would
result in unnecessary and undue hardship or practical difficulties for the
applicant, as distinguished from mere inconvenience.
   4.    Not Resulting from Applicant Action. The special circumstances,
practical difficulties or hardship that are the basis for the variance have not
resulted from any act, undertaken subsequent to the adoption of this Code or
any applicable amendment thereto, of the applicant or of any other party with a
present interest in the property, such as knowingly authorizing or proceeding
with construction or development requiring any variance, permit or approval
hereunder prior to obtaining such variance, permit or approval.
   5.    Preserves Rights Conferred by District. A variance is necessary for
the applicant to enjoy a substantial property right possessed by other
properties in the same zoning district and does not confer a special privilege
ordinarily denied to other properties in the district.
   6.    Necessary for Use of Property. The granting of a variance is necessary
not because it shall increase the applicant's economic return, although it may
have this effect, but because without a variance the applicant shall be
deprived of reasonable use or enjoyment of, or reasonable economic return from,
the property.
   7.    Not Alter Local Character. The granting of the variance shall not
alter the essential character of the locality nor substantially impair
environmental quality, property values, or public safety or welfare in the
vicinity.
   8.    Consistent With Code and Plan. The granting of a variance shall be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Code and of the
Comprehensive Plan of the City, as viewed in light of any changed conditions
since their adoption.
   9.    Minimum Variance Needed. The variance approved by the Board of Appeals
or Planning and Zoning Administrator is the minimum required to provide the
applicant with reasonable use and enjoyment of his property.
      (Ord. 19-145. Passed 1-13-20.)
1115.07 DEFINITIONS.
   A Minor variance is defined as any deviation from a Part 11 Planning and
Zoning Code stipulation that is less than a twenty-five percent (25%) deviation
of the requirement.

classification.
   3. Consistent with Comprehensive Plan Objectives.
The proposed use or zoning classification is in harmony with the objectives of
the Comprehensive Plan of the City as viewed in light of any changed conditions
since its adoption.
   4. Furthers Public Interest.
The proposed use or zoning classification promotes the public interest and not
solely the interest of the applicant.
   (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1117.04 TABLE 6: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR REZONING TO HO DISTRICT.

affected property owners of reasonable use of or reasonable economic return
from their property.
   4. Consistent With Adjacent Property or Preservation Plan.
The placement of the property or area in the HO District is consistent with the
historic significance or HO zoning of adjacent property or with a plan for
preserving all suitable properties, or areas of historic, cultural or
architectural significance in the City and does not represent an arbitrary
imposition only upon certain properties or areas with such significance.
   (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1117.05 APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR ALLEY VACATIONS.
   In recommending approval or conditional approval of an alley vacation, the
Planning Commission shall transmit to Council written findings of fact that all
of the conditions below apply to the application. In granting approval or
conditional approval, Council shall similarly find that all of the following
conditions apply:
   1. Recent Trend of Development.
Is the request supported by or will it serve the recent trend of development in
the immediate area?
   2. Access to Adjacent Properties.
Does the alley provide access to other properties that abut the alley? If so,
do these properties have other means of access?
   3. Future Development Plans.
Is the alley vacation necessary for future development plans?
   4. Public Utilities.
Will future development plans allow for public utility easements if and/or when
needed by the City? (Ord. 95-59. Passed 5-8-95.)

1119.02 WHEN REQUIRED.
   (a)    A certificate of appropriateness shall be required for any property
in an HO District prior to:
            (1)    The issuance of any building permit, demolition permit,
certificate of compliance, or sign permit for such property; or
            (2)    The removal of any tree on such property; or
            (3)    Any action causing, in the judgment of the Zoning
Administrator, a material change in, addition to or removal of:
                  A.    The external architectural features of any structure on
such property, including the kind, color and texture of exterior building
materials and the type, character and design of doors, windows, signs, light
fixtures, moldings, railings and other appurtenances or any exterior change to
a principal or existing accessory structure that in the judgement of the Zoning
Administrator constitutes a major exterior change to the property.
      
   (b)    No certificate shall be required for:
      (1)   Routine maintenance and repair that does not involve structural
change or significant change, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, to
material, design, texture, color or other aspects of the outer appearance of a
property; or
            (2)    Any construction, alteration or demolition which in the

1119.07 TABLE 7: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)    In granting approval or conditional approval of a certificate of
appropriateness, the Board shall prepare written findings of fact that the
proposed alteration or change is compatible, as applicable, with the character
of:
           (1)    The existing property being altered; and
            (2)    Surrounding properties; and
            (3)    Adjacent public ways; and
            (4)    The historic district, if any, in which the property is
located.
   
   (b)    Such compatibility shall be judged with respect to the following
elements of design:
            (1)    Height and scale;
            (2)    Proportions of windows, doors, sign lettering and other
design features;
           (3)    Shape of roof;
           (4)    Materials, textures and colors; substitute materials may be
used if:
                  A.    They may be installed without irreversibly damaging or
obscuring the architectural features or trim of the building.
                  B.    The substitute material can match the historic material
in size, profile and finish so there is no change in character of the historic
building or area.
            (5)    Directional expression, or the horizontal or vertical
character of the structure;
            (6)    Open space, including setbacks and spacing between
structures or signs; and
            (7)    Landscaping.
            (8)    Other.
                  A.    The Board shall hold approval on items in which the
Zoning Administrator determines an alternative board or commission within the
City of Zanesville should provide a preliminary review or decision that may
aide the Board in their decision making process.
   
   (c)    It is not the intent of these criteria to prohibit such contemporary
design or architectural styles as may be compatible with a historic
environment.
   (d)   For approval of a certificate, the Board shall require only such
degree of compatibility as can be achieved without depriving the property owner
of reasonable use of and a reasonable economic return from his property.
   (e)   The Historic Preservation Board shall utilize the City of Zanesville
Design Guidelines, as adopted by the Zanesville City Council per Ordinance 19-
138, when making decisions on the compatibility of proposed construction of,
alterations to, and removal of properties within the HO District.

1121.01 PURPOSE.
   Certain uses cannot be allowable generally in a particular zoning district,
or in any zoning district, because of the impact their special character
creates on surrounding areas.
   Some such uses may, however, be allowed under special conditions. These uses
are provided for in this Zoning Code as Conditional uses and Special Permit
uses.
   Because Conditional and Special Uses are compatible with the applicable
zoning district only under special conditions, a Conditional or Special Use
permit is required before any use authorized herein as a Conditional or Special
use may be established.
   Except as specifically provided herein, all regulations of the applicable
zoning district, and all other applicable regulations of this and other City
ordinances, shall apply to conditional uses.
(Ord. 18-76. Passed 7-23-18.)
1121.02 APPROVAL PROCESS.
   Conditional uses shall be approved by the Planning & Zoning Administrator
only in conformance with the approval process provided in Chapter
1113, the applicable standards and approval criteria in Tables 8, 9, 10 and
1137.05, and other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 18-76. Passed 7-23-18.)
1121.03 EXISTING USES.
   Any lawful use existing on the date of adoption of this Zoning Code or any
amendment thereto that requires conditional use approval under such Code or
amendment, shall be considered a lawful conditional use without the need for
approval of a conditional use permit hereunder whether or not a conditionally
permitted use permit was ever issued prior to such date. It shall be the
responsibility of the user of the property to provide evidence of the existence
of the use on or prior to such date.
   Any change of, expansion of, addition to or structural alteration of such a
use subsequent to such date shall, however, require the approval of a
conditional use permit.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1121.04 REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a) In evaluating the suitability of a proposed conditional use, the
Planning & Zoning Administrator shall examine the following characteristics of
the proposed use and its individual structures or components:
      (1)   Location and orientation;
      (2)   Lot size;
      (3)    Size of facility, including floor area, structure height, design
capacity and anticipated employment;
      (4)    Site design and arrangement;
      (5)    Provisions affecting on- and off-site pedestrian and traffic
movement, vehicle storage and the passage of emergency vehicles;
      (6)    Appearance;
      (7)   Screening or landscaping;
      (8)   On- or off-site buffering from incompatible uses with open spaces
or transitional uses;
      (9)   Operations factors, such as hours of use or environmental controls;
and
      (10)   Other characteristics of the proposed use pertinent in the
judgment of the Board to an assessment of the impact of the use on the area.
   (b)   The Planning & Zoning Administrator may call upon technical experts or
have studies performed to determine specific development standards or
conditions for any particular conditional use.
(Ord. 18-76. Passed 7-23-18.)
1121.05 EXPANSION OR ALTERATION.
   Any expansion, enlargement or structural alteration of a conditional use
shall require an additional conditional use permit.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1121.06 ZERO LOT LINE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the provisions herein governing zero lot line
development are:
      (1)   To allow the development of single-family detached housing that
makes more efficient use of land and provides more usable open space on the
lot, especially where lots are smaller, by allowing the width of one interior
side yard to be reduced to zero for the purpose of creating more usable open
space on the remainder of a lot;
      (2)   To assure that the design of such housing development provides a
suitable environment both for its occupants and the neighborhood; and
      (3)   To thereby encourage the provision of higher-density affordable
housing that is detached, that tends to be owner-occupied, and that is thereby
more compatible with existing residential areas in the City.
   (b)   Approval Process. Zero lot line development of single-family detached
homes may be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a Special use in the
zoning districts specified in this Zoning Code consistent with the approval
process provided for conditional uses in Chapter
1113 and with applicable standards and approval criteria in Tables 8 and 10,
Sections
1121.07 and
1121.09.
(Ord. 18-76. Passed 7-23-18.)
1121.07 TABLE 8: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   In granting approval or conditional approval of a conditional use, the
Planning & Zoning Administrator shall prepare written findings of fact that on
the basis of the characteristics cited under Section
1121.04, or changes to such characteristics that staff requires, the proposed
use shall be compatible with existing uses in the area, and with permitted uses
in the zoning district, in the following ways:
   1.    Traffic. Any adverse impact of types or volumes of traffic flow not
otherwise typical in the zoning district has been minimized.
   2.    Environmental Nuisance. Any adverse effects of noise, glare, odor,
dust, waste disposal, blockage of light or air, or other adverse environmental
effects of a type or degree not characteristic of permitted uses in the zoning
district, have been appropriately controlled.
   3.   Neighborhood Character. The proposed use shall fit harmoniously with
the existing natural or man-made character of its surroundings and with
permitted uses in the zoning district. The use shall not have undue deleterious
effect on the environmental quality, property values or neighborhood character
already existing in the area or normally associated with permitted uses in the
district.
   4.   Public Services and Facilities. The proposed use shall not require
existing community facilities or services to a degree disproportionate to that
normally expected of permitted uses in the district, nor generate
disproportionate demand for new services or facilities, in such a way as to
place undue burdens upon existing development in the area.
   5.    Public Safety and Health. The proposed use shall not be detrimental to
the safety or health of the employees, patrons or visitors associated with the
use nor of the general public in the vicinity.
   6.    Other Factors. The proposed use is in harmony with any other elements
of compatibility pertinent in the judgment of the staff to the particular
conditional use or its particular location.
(Ord. 18-76. Passed 7-23-18.)

in conformance with the City Building Code. In manufactured home parks,
dwellings shall be anchored in a manner approved by the Public Service
Director.
      (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1121.09 TABLE 10: STANDARDS AND APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR ZERO LOT LINE
DEVELOPMENTS.
   In granting approval or conditional approval of a conditional use for a zero
lot line single-family detached residential development, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall prepare written findings of fact that the proposed use shall
comply with the following standards in addition to other criteria applicable to
conditional uses generally:
   1. Minimum Size.
No zero lot line development shall include fewer than twelve lots. Zero lot
line design shall not apply to isolated individual lots in areas of
conventionally sited dwellings.
   2. Yards.
Only a rear yard and/or a single side yard, but no front yard, may be reduced
to zero.
Yards on adjacent lots may not both be reduced to zero if they abut the same
side lot line.
If a side yard is reduced to zero, the remaining side yard shall have a minimum
width of fifteen feet.
   3. Wall Maintenance Easement.
A perpetual wall maintenance easement shall be provided in every yard that is
adjacent to a zero side yard in an adjoining lot.
The easement shall be four feet in width measured from that portion of the lot
line that is adjacent to a building on the other lot.
The easement shall be shown on the plat and incorporated into each deed
transferring title to the property. Proof of recording of such easements shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a building
permit.
Obstructions otherwise permitted in interior side yards are allowed within the
easement provided they do not impede access to the wall on the adjacent lot for
painting, cleaning, maintenance and repair.
Roof overhangs may project up to two feet into the easement on the adjacent
lot, but the roof shall be so designed that water runoff onto the other lot is
confined to the easement area.
   4. Wall Openings.
No windows, doors, air conditioning units or other openings shall be permitted
on the side of a building abutting a zero side yard.
   5. Orientation.
Where possible, the building wall abutting the zero side yard should face north
to allow maximum use of the remaining yards for outdoor activities at different
times of the year.
   6. Varied Height and Setback.
Where possible, front yard depth, building height and roof lines should be
varied to avoid monotonous appearance, which is more objectionable when homes
are closer together and lots are smaller.
   7. Block Length.
Where possible, shorter blocks and cul-de-sac streets should be used to reduce
the monotony of site design.
   8. Open Space.
Any common open space areas provided shall meet requirements for ownership,
maintenance, upkeep, covenants and financial guarantees specified in this
Zoning Code for common open space in Planned Unit Developments.

1129.03 NONRESIDENTIAL USES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Yard requirements for nonresidential permitted and conditional uses
except permitted public uses and conditional public uses and temporary uses
shall be the same as required for single-family detached dwellings in the same
zoning district. Where a building height is over thirty-five feet, however,
each required yard shall be increased by two feet for each additional foot of
building height over thirty-five feet.
   (b)   The lot width and area requirements for each nonresidential permitted
use except permitted public uses and temporary uses shall be the same as
required per dwelling unit in the same district. For nonresidential conditional
uses, such requirements shall be as determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
For both nonresidential permitted and conditional uses, maximum building height
shall be governed by a maximum floor area ratio of 0.6 and off-street parking
and loading and landscaping requirements and sign regulations shall be as
provided in Chapters
1149,

the Zoning Administrator shall issue a permit that sets forth any conditions or
restrictions.
   (d)   A temporary use permit shall be revocable and valid for a period not
exceeding thirty days or such other period as the Zoning Administrator may
establish, whichever is less. Renewal of the permit by the Zoning Administrator

1129.07 MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
   (a)   Legislative Purpose.  Although medical marijuana is in some respects
legal under applicable state law, it remains illegal under federal law. The
purpose of this Section is to prohibit the use of certain real property in the
City for a medical marijuana-related business or home occupations. This Section
is expressly adopted as an exercise of the City's power of local self-
government and Home Rule authority contained in Section 3, Article XVIII of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio, and pursuant to the provisions of Ohio
Revised Code Section 3796.29.
   (b)   Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply for all purposes
under the Zoning Code:

CHAPTER 1134
Special Use Permit
1134.01   Process.
1134.01 PROCESS.
   The purpose of establishing a Special Use Permit process is to ensure that a
proposed use is conducted in a manner that is harmonious and compatible with
uses located on the same or surrounding properties. The process recognizes
that, within a given zoning district, certain uses may be appropriate and
compatible in some locations but not in others. The Special Use Permit process
allows a site-specific inquiry into the compatibility of a proposed use at a
particular location, taking into account: the characteristics of the site and
the surroundings; the relevant zoning and planning principles; and the input of
the reviewing parties.
   (a)   Authority. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a Special Use
Permit, and the decision is final.
    (b)   Appeals. Decisions may be appealed by the applicant or directly
impacted party to the Court of Common Pleas.
   (c)   Application.  Applications are available and processed by the Planning
& Zoning Administrator or designee.
   (d)   Previous Special Use Permits. If a Special Use Permit has been denied,
the use that was denied may not be re-applied for, at the same location, until
twelve full months have passed since the final denial date.
   (e)   Precedents. The fact that a Special Use Permit for the same or similar
use has been granted previously for the subject property or nearby property is
a factor to be considered, but is not determinative.
   (f)   Burden of Proof. The applicant bears the burden of proof to establish
that the approval of a Special Use Permit is warranted.
   (g)   Expiration. A Special Use Permit will expire when the use ceases at
the location for six continuous months where issued and/or when majority
ownership changes.
   (h)   Determinations. In order to approve a proposed Special Use Permit
application, the Board of Zoning Appeals must determine that:
      (1)   The proposed use can be conducted in a manner that is harmonious
and compatible with existing surrounding land uses, and with future surrounding
land uses as projected by the General Plan.
      (2)   The subject site is physically suitable for the type and intensity
of land use being proposed;
      (3)   Street or highway facilities providing access to the property are
or will be adequate in size to meet the requirements of the proposed use; and
      (4)   Approval of the Special Use Permit at the site in question will not
be inconsistent with or compromise the public health, safety and welfare or the
overall objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.

The roof shall be pitched at not less than a 1:4 ratio between vertical rise
and horizontal run, except over porches or attached garages or carports, unless
site-built dwellings with flat roofs are common in its environs. The roofing
material shall be of a type or shall resemble a type commonly found on site-
built dwellings.

the Community Development Director may reduce a percentage and/or the entirety
of the required setbacks outlined in Section
1137.03 Table 11. The Community Development Director shall review and provide a
written finding of fact for such a reduction based on the following criteria:
   (a)   Feasibility for Development.  The specific conditions of the subject
parcel create an undue hardship for the property owner to develop the lot.
   (b)   Economic Viability of the Development.  The project would not be
economically viable under the current setback standards.
   (c)   Neighborhood Characteristics.  The reduction in setback standards is
consistent with the surrounding community characteristics.
   (d)   Public Health, Safety, and General Well-Being. The reduction in the
setback standards will not jeopardize the public health, safety, or general
well-being. Additionally, it will not add an undue burden on city provided
services.

1145.01  AE AGRICULTURE AND ESTATE DISTRICT.
   (a)    Purpose. This district is intended:
      (1)    To provide land outside of the intensely developed portions of the
City for agriculture and low-density estate single-family residences prior to
the time such land is needed for urban development;
      (2)    To allow continued agriculture cultivation of such land prior to
its development
      (3)    To discourage the scattering of parcels of intensive development
and the premature and uneconomic extension of public facilities and services;
and
      (4)    To encourage the maintenance of open areas for future urban uses
that will require large undeveloped sites.
   (b)    Regulations. As provided in Tables 16 and 17, Sections
1145.05 and
1145.06.
(Ord. 11-62. Passed 10-11-11.)
1145.02 CO CONSERVANCY OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)    Purpose. This is an overlay district that imposes requirements in
addition to those of one or more underlying zoning districts. It is intended:
      (1)    To control development in areas subject to flooding and high
ground water levels and thereby prevent property damage in these areas and in
their surroundings;
      (2)    To protect areas of special environmental sensitivity by directing
development to other portions of a site;
      (3)    To preserve natural drainageways for economical disposal of storm
water;
      (4)    To insure that adverse soil or slope conditions are overcome prior
to development; and
      (5)    To accomplish the forgoing objectives without economic loss to the
property owner by permitting a transfer of land use intensity from the
conservancy area to other portions of a development site.
   (b)    Regulations. As provided in Tables 16 and 17, Sections
1145.05 and
1145.06.
(Ord. 11-62. Passed 10-11-11.)
1145.03 HO HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)    Purpose. This is an overlay district that imposes requirements in
addition to those of one or more underlying zoning districts. It is intended:
      (1)    To protect and enhance the cultural, educational, and living
environments of the City by affording special protection to structures and
neighborhoods with special historic, cultural or architectural character;
      (2)    To stimulate appropriate investment in and improvement of such
structures and neighborhoods by assuring a controlled neighborhood environment
compatible with the improvement of historic properties;
      (3)    To promote business and economic development by preserving
neighborhoods having special character to attract residents and visitors;
      (4)    To preserve the existing character and property values of the
oldest parts of the City by discouraging incompatible change and development;
and
      (5)    To prevent blight and decay in sound older neighborhoods.

1149.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the amount and location of
vehicle parking, loading areas, access, and mobility in order to promote a more
efficient use of land, enhance the development form, encourage the use of
alternative modes of transportation, provide for better pedestrian and bicycle
movement, and protect air and water quality. The provisions of this section are
intended to:
   (a)   Prevent and alleviate the congestion of public streets;
   (b)   Encourage the incorporation of alternative modes of transportation by
emphasizing pedestrian circulation and establishing requirements for bicycle
parking;
   (d)   Increase and protect the capacity of the roadway system;
   (d)   Minimize the detrimental effects of vehicular use areas on adjacent
properties;
   (e)   Encourage the reduction of impervious surfaces through effective
design and shared parking where practical; and
   Promote the health, safety, and public welfare by establishing minimum
requirements for off-street parking and loading areas as well as provisions for
access control.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   New Uses. The requirements of this chapter shall apply to any zoning
permit application involving the construction of a new structure or use in any
district.
   (b)   Expanded Uses.
      (1)   Whenever a building or use created prior to the effective date of
this code is expanded or enlarged in floor area, number of units, seating
capacity, or otherwise that will create a need for an increase in the number of
parking spaces, loading spaces, or vehicle stacking spaces, the additional
spaces shall be provided on the basis of the new demand created by the area of
the alteration, addition or change.
      (2)   If the proposed change, expansion or enlargement will increase
floor area, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or other area to an
extent larger than thirty-five percent (35%) of the building or use prior to
the effective date of this code, then the entire site shall come into
compliance with the requirements of this chapter and landscaping and buffering
requirements as prescribed in the Code.
      (3)   Any expansion, or enlargement smaller than the established in
subsection (b)(2) above shall comply with the requirements of this chapter for
any new parking, loading or stacking space areas required by the expansion. In
cases where these small expansions or enlargements occur over a period of time
after the effective date of this code, the site shall come into full compliance
with the requirements of this chapter and landscaping and buffering
requirements in the Code, once the total expansion or enlargement of the floor
area, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or other area exceed thirty-
five percent (35%) of the original size at the time this code became effective.
      (4)   If a vehicular use area is expanded without an expansion of any
buildings or structures, the expansion shall be reviewed through the zoning
permit process.
   (c)   Zoning Compliance. No certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be
authorized unless the use meets the minimum number of parking spaces required
by this chapter.
   (d)   Existing Uses. The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to
buildings and uses legally in existence on the effective date of this code
unless modified in the manner stated in subsection (b) or (c) hereof.
Furthermore, any facilities regulated by this chapter that serve such existing
buildings or uses shall not be reduced below the requirements established in
this chapter in the future.
   (e)   Planned Unit Developments. All development in a PUD shall be subject
to the standards of this chapter unless otherwise modified through the PUD
review and approval process. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.03 SIZE OF REQUIRED FACILITIES.
   Sizes of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided for all new
uses and existing uses that are enlarged, expanded or changed, in conformance
with the standards of Table 18, Section
1149.26. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.04 EXCEPTION FOR C-3 DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.
   In recognition of the existing character and pedestrian orientation of the
City's older downtown business areas, no off-street parking or loading shall be
required for individual uses located entirely within the C-3 Downtown
Commercial District. This exception is made to minimize curb cuts disruptive to
safe and efficient pedestrian circulation and to encourage provision of off-
street parking in centralized locations that serve multiple uses.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.05 PRESERVATION AND REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SPACES.
   No off-street parking or loading spaces either provided in conformity with
the provisions of this or a previous Zoning Code or voluntarily provided in
excess of what such provisions require, shall be reduced in size or number
below the requirements herein, or further below such requirements, so long as
the use they serve continues in operation.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.06 SUBMISSION OF SITE PLAN.
   (a)   A site plan showing off-street parking and loading facilities shall
accompany an application for any of the following for any use required to
provide over four off-street parking spaces or one or more off-street loading
spaces:

      (2)   Conditional use permit;
      (3)   Rezoning;
      (4)   Preliminary or final plat approval as provided in the Subdivision
Control Ordinance;
      (5)   Variance from off-street parking or loading requirements; and
      (6)   Planned unit development preliminary or final plan.
   (b)   The Zoning Administrator may waive or defer this requirement in any
instance in which the specific use of the premises, and therefore the specific
parking and loading requirements applicable, are not yet determined, such as in
the case of a rezoning for an industrial subdivision. The site plan shall meet
the requirements of Table 2, Section
1113.14.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.07 STORAGE AND REPAIR.

Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.08 ACCESS.
   Each required off-street parking space and loading space shall open directly

used for parking or loading purposes.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.11 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   All off-street parking and loading areas shall be landscaped and screened as
provided in Chapter
1151. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.12 USE OF PARKING SPACES.
    Except as otherwise provided herein, required off-street parking shall be

(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.13 SMALL CAR PARKING SPACES.
      Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of required off-street parking spaces may

1149.26, provided that such spaces are clearly identified by signs and pavement
markings as intended for small cars only.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.14 COLLECTIVE PROVISION.
   Required parking spaces for different uses may be provided collectively.

separate use. A binding written agreement shall be filed with an application
for a building permit guaranteeing the intended users of collective parking
spaces the right to their use. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.15 SURFACING OF PARKING AREAS.
   Except in the case of single-family detached dwellings, all open off-street
parking areas and related vehicular access drives and aisles shall be surfaced
with an asphalt, concrete, brick or paving block pavement. (Ord. 19-92. Passed
9-9-19.)
1149.16 OFF-STREET PARKING ALTERNATIVES.
   (a)   Land Banked Parking. Up to fifty percent (50%) of the required parking
spaces may remain landscaped and unpaved, or paved with pervious pavement,
provided that the parking and unpaved areas complies with the following
standards and is authorized in accordance with this section.
      (1)   The parking plan submitted with the site plan application shall
denote the location and layout of that portion of the parking area that
currently is deemed not required. The plan shall indicate the "land banked"
parking spaces will be constructed according to these regulations in the event
that the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines at any time that all or
any portion of this parking is necessary.
      (2)   The applicant shall be required to design the site for full
compliance with the applicable storm water regulations, lighting regulations,
and landscaping regulations even though a portion of the parking area may not
be developed initially.
      (3)   Any conditions required by the City, and the design for the site as
established above, shall be illustrated on a final site plan, approved as part
of the zoning permit application and maintained as part of the City's official
records.
      (4)   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking area that
is so designated for future construction be used for construction of any
structure or paved surface with the exception that pervious pavement may be
used to provide temporary parking provided that the pavers allow for grass and
other vegetation to grow through the material.
      (5)   At no time shall any portion of the land banked parking or loading
area that is so designated for future construction as provided herein be
counted as open space or other non-paved areas required by other provisions of
the code.
      (6)   The owner shall initiate construction of the approved land banked
parking area(s), as identified on the approved parking plan, within three
months of the receipt of a certified letter or a letter through normal postal
service (in the event that the certified letter is not accepted) sent to the
owner of record from the Planning and Zoning Administrator, identifying that
such parking is determined to be necessary. Such determinations may be made:
         A.   When the Planning and Zoning Administrator is reviewing an
application related to a change of use or activity; or
         B.   When the Planning and Zoning Administrator, or their designee,
documents that vehicles related to the use are consistently parked on the
grass, landscaping area, or on the street.
      (7)   Off-site or shared parking alternatives shall not be permitted
where land bank parking is utilized. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.17 SHARED PARKING OR OFF-STREET PARKING.

parking or up to 100 percent of a parking lot may be utilized for off-site
parking provided it complies with the standards of this subsection.
   (b)   Shared parking is encouraged and permitted if the multiple uses that
the shared parking will benefit can cooperatively establish and operate the
facilities and they are located on the same or adjacent properties.
   (c)   The applicant shall have the burden of proof for reduction of the
total number of parking spaces and shall document and submit information
substantiating their request.
   (d)   Shared parking may be approved if:
      (1)   A sufficient number of spaces is provided to meet the highest
demand of the participating uses;
      (2)   Evidence has been submitted by the parties operating the shared
parking facility, to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Administrator,
documenting the nature of uses and the hours when the individual uses will
operate so as to demonstrate the lack of potential conflict between them.
   (e)   Off-site parking shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking
standards for residential uses or hospitals. Required parking spaces reserved
for persons with disabilities shall not be located in an off-site parking area.
   (f)   No off-site parking space shall be located more than 500 feet from the
primary entrance of the use served, the off-site parking areas shall still
adhere to the vehicular use landscaping regulations of the code.
   (g)   If an off-site parking area is located in a different zoning district

1149.18 WHEEL STOPS AND CONTINUOUS CURBS.
   (a)   Wheel stops or continuous curbs shall be provided in areas adjacent to
sidewalks, walkways, and landscaping areas to protect such areas from damage or
encroachment of vehicles and to provide necessary traffic control in the
vehicular use area.
   (b)   Each wheel stop shall be a singular block of reinforced concrete,
stone, or other durable material with dimensions capable of preventing vehicles
from rolling over the wheel stop, preferably five inches in height, six inches
in width and eight feet in length. Wheel stops shall be securely attached to
the ground and may be used only at the end of parking stalls.
   (c)   Continuous curbs shall be made of concrete or stone, and shall be a
minimum of six inches in height and six inches in width. They shall form a non-
interrupted edge around all landscaped areas adjacent to parking and turn-
around areas which are not protected by wheel stops. Continuous curbs may be
modified or interrupted for the purposes of accommodating storm water runoff.
   (d)   The wheel stop or continuous curb shall be located a minimum of four
feet from any structures, buildings, walls, or the trunk of a tree to prevent a
vehicle from driving onto the landscape area or hitting any structure or plant
material at the edge of the vehicular use area. The separation may be reduced
to two feet from the edge of any shrub. The mature size of the plant material
shall be specified to determine if the landscaping meets the setback
requirements.
   (e)   Where continuous curbs are used, the paved area of the parking stall
length may be reduced by two feet provided that the vehicle overhang will not
encroach on pedestrian circulation or the required setback for desirable plant
growth. Where wheel stops are used, the paved area of the parking stall length
required shall not be reduced.
(Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.19 LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   On Same or Separate Lot. Required off-street parking for single-family
detached and attached dwellings and manufactured homes on individual lots shall
be provided on the same lot as the use served. Parking spaces within garages or
carports and on driveways shall be counted as required spaces for such
dwellings.
   Required parking for other uses may also be provided on a separate lot that
is in the same possession by deed or lease. No parking on a separate lot for
any nonresidential use shall be separated from the use by any residentially-
zoned property not in the same possession as the use.
   Required parking for all uses with the exception noted in Section
1149.19 (a) shall be located no more than 500 feet from the nearest point of
the parking area to the nearest entrance to the use served.
   (b)   In Yards.
      (1)   Single-family and townhouses. Required off-street parking for
single-family detached and attached and townhouse dwellings may be located in
front, side and rear yards.
         For every 800 square feet of area contained within the actual front or
corner side yard, one motor vehicle may be located forward of the actual
building line opposite the front or corner side lot line the front of the
dwelling faces, provided that the vehicle is located entirely on a driveway.
Any additional motor vehicles shall be parked to the rear of such building
line. Except that where the dimensions of actual side yards and the absence of
an alley preclude vehicular access to the side and rear yards, this restriction
shall not apply.
         Where, because of the slope of a lot, location of a garage outside of
the required front or corner side yard would necessitate a driveway slope
greater than twelve percent (12%), the garage may be located within the
required yard a minimum of six feet from the street line.
      (2)   Other uses. Required off-street parking for other uses may be
located in required front, side and rear yards in all districts subject to the
requirements for parking screening strips in Section
1151.03(b).
         No off-street parking, driveway or other accessway for any non-single-
family residential use is permitted within any required yard abutting property
in an RS District. No parking for any nonresidential use is permitted within
any required yard abutting property in any residential district.
         Parking of motor vehicles on residential lots shall be limited to
residents and visitors to that property or adjacent residential property only.
All residential driveways and parking areas shall be properly maintained with
an asphalt, concrete, brick, paving block or dust free crushed aggregate
surface. (Ord. 19-92. Passed 9-9-19.)
1149.20 PARKING OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.
   (a)    In Residential Districts. A single recreational vehicle as defined

         A.    The vehicle shall be parked in a garage, carport or covered
parking space, where one is available on the premises large enough to
accommodate the vehicle;
         B.   Otherwise, the vehicle shall be parked in the driveway to the
rear of the actual building line of the principal building that is opposite the
street to which the driveway has access where this is possible to do;
         C.   Otherwise, where the dimensions of actual side yards and the
absence of an alley make compliance with subsection (a)(4)B. impossible, the
vehicle shall be parked in the driveway ahead of such building line but not
encroaching upon any public sidewalk;
         D.   Otherwise, where the dwelling unit does not have its own
driveway, the vehicle shall be parked in an open off-street parking space.
   (b)   In Other Districts. There shall be no restrictions on parking of
recreational vehicles in nonresidential districts, other than those concerning

1151.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the requirements in this chapter is to provide for
appropriate landscaping and screening of parking and other outdoor areas that
shall:
   (a)   Improve the appearance of vehicular use areas and property abutting
public rights of way;
   (b)   Require buffering between different land uses; to protect, preserve
and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the surrounding
neighborhoods;
   (c)   Promote public health and safety through the reduction of noise
pollution, air pollution, visual pollution, air temperature and artificial
light glare;
   (d)   Promote and encourage storm water mitigation using landscape features
on new and existing sites;
   (e)   Promote the preservation and replacement of trees and significant
vegetation removed in the course of land development;
   (f)   Promote the proper utilization of landscaping between certain land
uses to minimize the opportunities for nuisances.
      (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.02 STORM WATER MITIGATION USING LANDSCAPE FEATURES.
   Applicants for new and existing site development may be eligible for storm
water mitigation credits from the City of Zanesville. Specific landscape
features developed and implemented which mitigate storm water impacts of hard
surfaces are eligible for credits. See the current City Storm water Credits
Manual and Storm Water Codes for eligible landscape features and credits
available. (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.03 MINIMUM LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS.
   This section describes the minimum requirements that shall be met in regard
to perimeter buffer landscaping for different land uses, perimeter landscaping
for vehicular use areas, interior landscaping and shading of parking lots,
landscaping for service areas, and additional site landscaping for businesses,
buildings, structures or other new developments.
   (a)   Perimeter Buffer Landscaping Requirements.
      (1)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to require buffering
between different land uses and along certain public rights-of-way (property
perimeter requirements). See Section
1151.10, Table 23 for specific requirements.
      (2)   Opacity requirements. Landscape materials, earth mounding, fences,
and walls used to fulfill perimeter buffering requirements shall be installed
to provide 100 percent year round opacity. Plant material used to fulfill the
requirements of this section must be evergreen and meet height and opacity
requirements within four years after installation.
      (3)   Perimeter buffer landscape zone. The perimeter buffer landscape
zone shall be provided by the property under development.
   (b)   Parking Screening Strip (Edge of Parking Area).
      (1)   Purpose. Parking Screening Strip requirements provide buffering of
area used by vehicles such as parking lots and driveways from adjacent property
or public rights-of-way. See Section
1151.11, Table 24 for specific requirements.
      (2)   Berming. For optimum screening effectiveness and improved landscape
design, parking screening strips in front of corner side yards of uses
providing over 120 open off-street parking spaces shall be bermed so as to
largely conceal parked cars from view of the street except where in the
judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals the size, configuration or existing or
proposed topography of the lot makes this infeasible or unnecessary or where
erosion, drainage or maintenance problems might result. Berms shall be a
minimum of two feet high at all points.
      (3)   Requirements conflicts. Whenever a parcel or activity falls under
two or more of the categories listed in Section
1151.11, Table 24, only the category with the most stringent requirements shall
be required.
      (4)   Perimeter buffer landscape zone conflicts. The required perimeter
buffer landscape zone may be combined with a utility or other easement as long
as all of the landscape requirements can be provided in addition to, and
separate from, any other easement. Cars or other objects shall not overhang or
otherwise intrude upon the required perimeter buffer landscape zone more than
two and one-half feet, and wheel stops or curbs shall be required.
      (5)   Existing landscape material. Existing landscape material shall be
shown on the required plan, and any material in satisfactory condition may be
used to satisfy these requirements in whole or in part when, in the opinion of
the public service authority, such material meets the requirements and achieves
the objectives of this chapter.
      (6)   Landscaping at driveway and street intersections.  To ensure that
landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard, a sight triangle shall
be observed at all street intersections or intersections of driveways and
streets. Within this sight triangle, no landscape material or parked vehicles,
except for required grass or ground cover, shall be permitted. Trees shall be
permitted within the sight triangle, as long as only the tree trunk is visible
between the ground and a height of eight (8) feet above the ground, except
during early growth stages, or as long as the tree otherwise dos not present a
traffic visibility hazard.
         A.   Driveway intersection sight triangle. At intersections of
driveways with streets, the sight triangle shall be established by locating the
intersection of the street curb with the driveway edge, and by measuring from
this point to a distance of ten (10) feet along the driveway to a point and a
distance of thirty (30) feet along the street curb to a point and connecting
these points.
         B.   Street intersection sight triangle. At street intersections, the
sight triangle shall be formed by measuring 30 feet along each curb line from
the intersection point of the two streets and connecting the end points.
   (c)   Parking Island Strip (In Interior of Parking Area).
      (1)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to break up large areas
of impervious surfaces in order to provide shade and heat abatement, and
enhance the appearance of the community.
      (2)   Applicability.  Any open vehicular use area, excluding loading,
unloading and storage areas in an industrial zone or business zone, containing
more than 6,000 square feet of area, or twenty (20) or more vehicular parking
spaces, shall provide interior landscaping in addition to the previously
required perimeter landscaping. Interior landscaping for vehicular use areas
may be peninsular or island types, and must include at least one deciduous
shade tree per peninsula or island in order to be counted towards the required
landscape area.
      (3)   Landscape Area. For each 100 square feet or fraction thereof, of
vehicular use area, a minimum total of five (5) square feet of landscaped area
shall be provided.
         A.   Minimum Area. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be 112
square feet with a minimum inside dimension width of seven (7) feet, and a four
(4)-foot minimum dimension to all trees from edge of pavement where vehicles
overhang.
         B.   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly dispersed
            1.   For vehicular use areas of less than 30,000 square feet, no
individual landscape area shall be larger than 350 square feet in size.
            2.   For vehicular use areas over 30,000 square feet, no individual
landscape area shall be larger than 1,500 square feet in size.
            3.   In both cases, the least dimension of any required area shall
be four feet minimum dimension to all trees from edge to pavement where
vehicles overhang.
            4.   Individual landscape areas larger than above are permitted as
long as the additional area is in excess of the required minimum total.
      (4)   Tree Planting Requirement. The following number and size of trees
are required within the interior landscaped area. This requirement is based
upon total ground coverage of structures and vehicular areas:
         A.   There shall be a minimum of one tree for every 5,000 square feet
of ground coverage. Trees must be at least two and one-half inches in caliper
at installation.
         B.   Small trees shall not be used to fulfill this requirement, but
are allowed as part of the overall planting design. See Section
1151.12, Table 25 for definition of Small trees.
         C.   Trees shall have a clear trunk from the ground to at least five
(5) feet above the ground, and the remaining landscaped area shall be covered
with hardwood mulch or planted with shrubs or ground cover, with no element to
exceed two (2) feet in height.
      (5)   Vehicle over-hang.  Parked vehicles may hang over the interior
landscaped area no more than two and one-half (2 ½) feet, as long as concrete
or other wheel stops are provided to ensure no greater overhang or penetration
of the landscaped area.
   (d)   Screen (Around Other Open Uses).
      (1)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to screen Service
Structures from public view.
      (2)   Applicability. Service structures shall be screened in all zoning
districts. For the purposes of this section, service structures shall include
but not limited to loading docks, storage tanks, dumpsters, electrical
transformers, HVAC units, utility vaults which extend above the surface,
cooling towers, roof top units and other equipment or elements providing
service to a building or site. Structures may be grouped together; however,
screening height shall be based upon the tallest of the structures. Roof top
mechanical units must be screened to the full height of the unit.
      (3)   Screening requirements. A continuous (having 100% opacity) hedge,
vertical planting, fence wall or mound of earth is required to enclose any
service structures on all sides, unless such structure must be frequently moved
or serviced, in which case screening on all but one side is required. The
height of the screening material shall be one foot more than the height of the
enclosed structure, but shall not be required to exceed twelve (12) feet in
height. Whenever a service structure is located next to a building wall,
perimeter landscaping material or vehicular use area landscaping material, such
walls or screening material may fulfill the screening requirement for that side
of the service structure if that wall or screening material is of sufficient
height to meet the height requirement set out in this section. Plant material
used to screen a service structure shall be an evergreen species which retains
its needles throughout the year. Deciduous plant material cannot be used to
fulfill this screening requirement. The height of the evergreen plant material
at installation must be equal to, or greater than, two-thirds (2/3) of the
height of the service structure(s), and meet the height and opacity
requirements within four (4) years. No interior landscaping shall be required
within an area screened for service structures.
      (4)   Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is emptied
or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a curb to contain the
placement of the container shall be provided within the screening material on
those sides where there is such material. The curbing shall be at least one (1)
foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent possible damage to the
screening when the container is moved or emptied.
   (e)   Additional Site Landscaping Requirements.
      (1)   Applicability.  All new developments, regardless of type, and all
alterations or expansions to existing developments, shall provide site
landscaping in addition to any previously required perimeter landscaping. Site
landscaping shall consist of foundation plantings, new tree planting or the
preservation of existing trees or hedges within the development site.
      (2)   Preservation of wooded areas. Efforts shall be made to preserve
natural vegetation areas. Streets, lots, structures and parking areas shall be
designed to avoid the unnecessary destruction of heavily wooded areas or
outstanding tree specimens. Whenever possible, heavily wooded areas may be
designated as park reserves. (Refer to Chapter
1152, Tree Preservation).
      (3)   Site planting requirements.
         A.   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide landscaping
to enhance the appearance and customer attraction of commercial and industrial
areas, to enhance the architectural character and aesthetics of residential
neighborhoods, and to enhance the beauty of the city. This section pertains to
additional landscaping located around the building and other portions of the
site. It does not include landscape material that has been provided to fulfill
the planting requirements for interior landscaping, vehicular use area
perimeters, property perimeters, and street trees. See Section
1151.12, Table 25 for specific requirements.
         B.   For all new development the following landscape requirements
shall apply:
            1.   All building facades fronting on a public street or plaza,
where the building is greater than four (4) feet from the sidewalk, shall have
continuous foundation plantings.
            2.   In the case of additions to existing buildings, the facades on
both the addition and the existing building shall be landscaped with continuous
foundation plantings.
            3.   Foundation plantings may be accommodated in planters or
clustered in landscaped beds when continuous plantings are not feasible.
         C.   Parking Lots: See division (b) of this section, Parking Screening
Strip.
         D.   New tree plantings shall not be required if the aggregate trunk
sizes of existing trees meet or exceed the requirements set forth in this
chapter and providing that the trees are evenly distributed throughout the
developed area and not confined either to dense clusters or to the perimeter of
the developed area. The minimum tree size for existing trees shall be no less
than two and one-half inches in trunk diameter. Trees to be preserved shall be
subject to review by the Community Development Department.
            (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.04 SITES AFFECTED.
   (a)   New Sites.  No certificate of zoning compliance or building permit
shall be issued for any site development, or the construction or improvement to
any building, structure or vehicular use area except where landscaping for such
development has been approved as required by the provisions of this subchapter.
   (b)   Existing Sites. No building, structure, or vehicular use area shall be
constructed or expanded unless the minimum landscaping required by the
provisions of this subchapter is provided to the property to the extent of its
alteration or expansion. In the case of a substantial expansion, the entire
site must be brought into compliance with the minimum requirements of this
subchapter. An alteration or expansion to an existing property is substantial
when:
      (1)   In the case of a building or structure expansion which does not
involve additional land, the square footage of the alteration or expansion
exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the square footage of the existing
building exclusive of the alteration or expansion.
      (2)   In the case of an alteration or expansion involving both an
existing building or structure and additional land, and if applicable,
additional structures or buildings, the area or square footage of the expanded
or altered land or structure or building, respectively, exceeds thirty-five
percent (35%) of the area or square footage of the existing land or structure
or building respectively, exclusive of the alteration or expansion.
         (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.05 VARIANCES.
   Any landscape plan disapproved by City Staff or the Planning Commission may
be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
hear requests for major variances from the landscape requirements of this
section in accordance with procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Minor
variances are reviewed and considered by City Staff.
(Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.06 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Because of their special characteristics, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
require conditional uses to provide landscaping or screening that exceeds the
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.07 LANDSCAPE MATERIALS.
   The landscaping materials shall consist of the following: the proposed
landscape materials should complement the form of the existing trees and
plantings, as well as the development's general design and architecture. The
type of shade and sun found on the site should be considered in selecting
planting materials.
   (a)   Earth Mounds. Earth mounds shall be physical barriers which block or
screen the view similar to a hedge, fence or wall. Mounds shall be constructed
with proper technique and planted with adequate plant material to prevent
erosion. A difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not
constitute an existing earth mound and shall not be considered as fulfilling
any screening requirement. Where mounds are to be mowed, the maximum permitted
side slope is 3 horizontal units per 1 vertical until (3:1).
   (b)   Plants. Artificial plants are prohibited. All plant materials shall be
living plants and shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Quality. Plant materials used in conformance with provisions of
this chapter shall be nursery grown in accordance with good horticulture
practices, grown under climatic conditions similar to those in central Ohio,
shall conform to the standards of the AmericanHort Organization and shall have
passed any inspections required under state regulations. In addition, trees
shall be free of disease, insects and/or damage, and shall be correctly labeled
indicating genus, species and cultivar. All trees must be transported from the
nursery or holding area in a covered fashion to protect the tree from wind
damage.
      (2)   Deciduous trees. Defined as trees which normally shed their leaves
in the fall.
         A.   Trees shall be species having an average mature crown spread of
greater than fifteen (15) feet in central Ohio. Tree having an average mature
crown spread of less than fifteen (15) feet may be substituted by grouping of
the same to create the equivalent of a fifteen (15) foot crown spread.
         B.   A minimum of ten feet overall height or a minimum caliper of at
least one and three-fourths (1 3/4) inches immediately after planting shall be
required (where caliper is trunk diameter measured six inches above the
ground). In areas which have visibility requirements, trees shall have trunks
which can be maintained clear of branches from the ground to a height of five
(f) feet above the ground. At vehicular use area intersections, trees shall
have trunks which can be maintained to be clear of branches from the ground to
a height of eight (8) feet above the ground.
         C.   Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to public
roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15)
feet to such public works, unless the tree root system is completely contained
within a barrier for which the construction dimensions shall be five feet
square and five feet deep, and for which the construction requirements shall be
four inch thick, reinforced concrete.
      (3)   Prohibited trees. Prohibited Trees shall be those currently listed
in Section
1151.13, Table 26 of the Zanesville Planning and Zoning Code.
      (4)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five (5)
feet high with a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches immediately after
planting.
      (5)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs shall be at least two (2) feet in minimum
height when planted, and both shrubs and hedges shall confirm to the opacity
and other requirements within four (4) years after planting.
      (6)   Vines. Vines shall be at least twelve (12) or fifteen (15) inches
long at planting, and are generally used in conjunction with walls or fences.
      (7)   Grass or ground cover. Lawns shall be planted in perennial mix
consisting of fescue, bluegrass or other members of the Grass Family (Poaceae),
or other species normally grown as permanent lawns in central Ohio. These lawns
may be sodded or seeded, except in swales or other areas subject to erosion,
where solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch shall be used, and
nurse-grass seed shall be sown for immediate protection until complete coverage
otherwise is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeks and noxious
pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be planted in such a manner as to present
a finished appearance and seventy-five percent (75%) of complete coverage after
complete growing seasons, with a maximum of eight inches on center. In certain
cases, ground cover also may consist of rocks, pebbles, sand and similar
approved materials.
   (c)   Maintenance and Installation. All landscaping materials shall be
installed in accordance with accepted, good construction and planting
procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
proper maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in proper,
neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times. All
unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one (1) year, or by
the next planting period, whichever comes first; while other defective
landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within three (3) months. All
nonliving landscaping, including fences, walls and ornamental lighting, shall
be maintained in a good condition at all times so as to present a healthy, neat
and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Violation
of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the City
to refuse zoning compliance or institute legal proceedings. Any individual
found to be in violation of this section shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor
per tree or other planting. (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)
1151.08 PLAN SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL.
   Whenever any property is affected by these landscape requirements, the
property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan for submittal to the
Community Development Department for review. Said landscape plan shall be
prepared by a Landscape Architect or industry certified landscape designer.
   (a)   Landscape Plan Content. The contents of the landscape plan shall
include the following:
      (1)   Site Plan.
         A.   Drawn to an easily readable scale no smaller than one (1) inch
equals twenty (20) feet;
         B.   Generally oriented such that north is at the top of the plan;
         C.   Showing and labeling by name, dimensions and square footage:
            1.   All existing and proposed property lines, easements, buildings
and other structures, vehicular use area including parking stalls, driveways,
service areas, water outlets, locations of structures within twenty (20) feet
of property lines on adjoining parcels, and
            2.   Landscape materials including botanical and common plant
names, installation sizes, on-center planting dimensions where applicable, and
quantities for all proposed plants and existing trees;
   (b)   Site grading with a minimum of one-foot contour intervals;
   (c)   Typical elevations and/or cross sections as may be required to
understand elements of the plan;
   (d)   Title block including zoning district, pertinent names and addresses,
identity of property owner, initials of person preparing the plan, along with
scale, date and north arrow. (Ord. 19-82. Passed 8-26-19.)

Notes for Table 26
Prohibited trees shall also include any that appear on lists of prohibited or
invasive plants published by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the Ohio
Department of Agriculture, or the Ohio Invasive Plant Council.
Number of varieties per street  As a rule, streets are more attractive when
they contain only one kind of tree. In new developments where an entire street
is to be planted it is suggested that the property owners agree on a single
variety. Although the planting along one street may be of a single variety, any
one community should have a dozen or more kinds. The use of several varieties
adds interest to the street-tree plantings of the City and insures against the
loss of all trees in case of an epidemic disease striking any one species. The
International Society of Arboriculture's "Diversification Formula" will be used
as a guideline to prevent overplanting of a single tree species or family. This
formula states that, out of the total tree planting, no more than ten percent
(10%) should be from one family, and no more than five percent (5%) should be
of one species. Sub-dividers or developers are requested to consult with the
Community Development Department for a list of the current recommended street
trees.

   (m)   And to promote the public health, safety, and welfare through the
preservation and replacement of trees while allowing for the reasonable
development of lands in such a manner that implements the stated goals,
objectives, policies and standards of the city. (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.02 APPLICABILITY.
   Applicants for new and existing site development may be eligible for storm
water mitigation credits from the City of Zanesville. Specific landscape
features developed and implemented which mitigate storm water impacts of hard
surfaces are eligible for credits. See the current City Storm water Credits
Manual and Storm Water Codes for eligible landscape features and credits
available.
   (a)   Trees. This subchapter applies to trees which have a minimum six-inch
diameter breast height (DBH), measured four-and-a-half feet above the ground,
hereinafter known as protected trees, on all public and private properties, in
all zoning districts except single family. However, owners of single family
lots will be encouraged to replace protected trees.
   (b)   Exempted Trees. This tree preservation subchapter shall not apply to
sites which have previously approved final development plans, final plat, or a
certificate of zoning compliance or other similar final approval by the city
prior to the date this provision takes effect.
   (c)   Tree Removal. No trees shall be removed from any parcel of land until
a tree removal permit has been issued signifying compliance with the
regulations of this Chapter by the Community Development Department or
designee, unless specifically exempted by the provisions of this Chapter.
   (d)   New Development or Construction. No building permit or certificate of
zoning compliance shall be issued for any development or the construction of
any building, structure or vehicular use without it first being determined
through the development plan review process that the proposed development is in
conformance with the provisions of this Chapter.
      (1)   Substantial Alteration or Expansion of Existing Development. No
building, structure or vehicular use area shall be substantially altered or
expanded without it first being determined through the development plan review
process that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of
this chapter. A substantial alteration or expansion is defined as the square
footage of the alteration or expansion exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the
square footage of the existing building, structure or vehicle use area
exclusive of the alteration or expansion.
         (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.03 PENALTY.
   In the event any violation of this chapter is committed, for which no
specific penalty is otherwise provided, the owner or owners of the building or
premises upon which the violation has been committed, any architect, builder or
contractor who assists in the commission of such violation and any person, firm
or corporation who violates or assists in the violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter, shall for each and every violation for
noncompliance be guilty of a minor misdemeanor, subject to a fine of one
hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day during which a violation or noncompliance
occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.04 PRE-CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   General regulations. Prior to any construction activities on a site
containing protected or public trees, a tree preservation plan including a tree
survey, a site plan addressing street tree and public tree requirements, and a
tree removal permit (if applicable) must be submitted to the city for review
and approval. Prior to any construction activities on a site containing
protected or public trees, excepting for heavily wooded sites, the developer or
owner shall be required to have tree replacement plan in place and approved.
   (b)   Certificate of zoning compliance. A certificate of zoning compliance
shall not be issued unless the tree survey and tree preservation plans have
been submitted and approved by the city. No work shall begin on the site until
the site has been inspected by the city for compliance with the tree
preservation plan, including installation of protective fencing and tree
preservation signage. In the event that work is started without the city
inspection, a re-inspection fee will be collected for each re-inspection.
   (c)   Site layout and design. All reasonable efforts shall be undertaken in
the architectural layout and site engineering design of the proposed
development to preserve existing protected trees.
      (1)   It shall be required that building(s), driveway(s), sidewalks, bike
paths, storm water management facilities, and parking areas be designed in such
a way as to avoid unnecessary removal of protected trees.
      (2)   The required drainage and grading plan, including storm water
management facilities, shall be developed in such a way as to avoid removal of
protected trees in tree preservation areas, caused by risk of loss through
change in grade or moisture.
      (3)   Proposed placement of all utility service lines shall be shown on
the tree preservation plan. Every effort shall be made to protect existing
protected trees during the placement of utility service lines including
directional boring as opposed to open cutting as appropriate. A copy of the
tree preservation plan and this subchapter shall be submitted at the
preliminary plat stage by the applicant to the appropriate public utilities in
order to alert said public utilities to the proposed placement of the utility
service lines.
      (4)   Landscape planning shall include the preservation of existing
healthy protected trees.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made during architectural and site
engineering layout and design, including grading and utility placement, of the
proposed development to preserve protected trees on adjacent parcels through
sensitivity to the critical root zones of said protected trees. The critical
root zones of protected trees on adjacent parcels shall be carefully reviewed
and consideration given during the preparation of the tree preservation plan.
         (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.05 TREE REMOVAL PERMIT.
   (a)   Issuance: No person shall remove, injure, destroy, disturb, or
undertake any procedure which is likely to cause the death or substantial
destruction of any protected tree without first procuring a tree removal permit
from the city. Tree removal permits authorizing the removal of a protected tree
may be issued by the Community Development Department or designee for the
following reasons:
      (1)   The tree is dead or dying;
      (2)   The tree is affected with any injurious disease, fungus, insect or
other pest;

1152.06 TREE PRESERVATION PLAN.
   (a)   Tree preservation and habitat protection.  All existing on-site
healthy trees shall be preserved to the fullest extent reasonable, unless
directed otherwise by the Community Development Department or designee. Special
consideration should be given to mature or exceptional specimens. If
appropriate, a habitat protection area shall be established to protect stream
banks, wetlands, steep slopes, wildlife scenic views and other unique natural
resources.
   (b)   Tree Preservation Plan. A tree preservation plan, which includes a
tree survey, shall be filed in connection with the following projects:
excavation, earth moving, demolition, road widening, road construction, road
extensions, parking lots, utility service lines, utility structures, bike
paths, sidewalks, the construction of new buildings, the construction of
building additions, the construction of detached accessory buildings. The tree
preservation plan and tree survey shall be filed prior to the commencement of
any construction activities, including clearing and grading, and must be
approved by the city. All structures and construction activity shall be located
upon a parcel of land in such a way as to minimize tree damage and/or removal,
consistent with the various setback requirements of the city Zoning Code and
consistent with standard engineering practices for the design of public and
private utilities, and with established erosion and sedimentation control
practices, and consistent with the city's storm water management regulations.
The tree preservation plan shall specify the following:
      (1)   Tree preservation area and building activity area on the parcel of
land;
      (2)   Tree survey to be drawn to a suitable scale, not to exceed 1" = 50
feet, showing all existing trees on the site with a six-inch diameter at breast
height (DBH) or greater. The tree survey shall indicate the location, species,
the condition, and the outline of the critical root zone or fifteen (15) feet
from base of trunk, whichever is greater;
      (3)   The location of all protective fencing;
      (4)   Location of all utility lines;
      (5)   Site grading;
      (6)   Specified locations for ingress, egress, operation and parking of
all construction vehicles and equipment, and storage of solvents, hazardous
materials, and soil and material stockpiles;
      (7)   Specified locations for all clearing, grubbing, grading and
excavation;
      (8)   Other measures such as construction pruning and root pruning of
trees directly impacted by construction must also be indicated on the plan or
on an accompanying sheet and approved by the city. Pruning shall be performed
in accordance with International Society of Arboriculture Standards and
American National Standards Institute A-300 Pruning Standards; and
      (9)   Short term and long term maintenance plans.
   (c)   Coordination.  The required tree preservation plan shall be
coordinated with all landscaping required by the Landscape Code, Section
1151, to achieve a cohesive landscape treatment for the entire site. (Ord. 19-
91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.07 CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Tree Preservation Plan. The approved tree preservation plan shall be
available on the building site before work commences and at all times during
construction of the project. The owner shall be responsible for notifying all
contractors and utilities involved with a given project of the tree
preservation plan.
   (b)   Construction Measures. During all phases of construction, all steps
necessary to prevent the destruction or damage to protected trees (other than
those specified to be removed) shall be taken, including but not limited to the
following:
      (1)   No construction activity, movement and/or placement of equipment,
vehicles, or materials or spoils storage shall be permitted within the tree
preservation area. No excess soils, additional fill, liquids, or construction
debris shall be placed within the critical root zone of any tree that is to be
preserved;
      (2)   All required protective fencing or other physical barrier must be
in place around the tree preservation area and approved by the city prior to
the beginning of construction, including site clearing. The owner shall be
responsible for the construction, erection, and maintenance of temporary
fencing or other physical barrier around the tree preservation areas so that
all protected trees shall be preserved. The fencing or other protective barrier
must be located a distance from the trunk that equals, at a minimum, the
distance of the critical root zone or fifteen (15) feet, whichever is greater,
unless otherwise approved by the Community Development Department or designee.
The fencing or other physical barrier must remain in place and be secured in an
upright position during the entire construction period to prevent impingement
of construction vehicles, materials, spoils, and equipment into or upon the
tree preservation area. Tree protection signs must be located along the
fencing. Any change in the protective fencing must be approved by the Community
Development Department;
      (3)   No attachments, including but not limited to ropes, nails,
advertising posters, signs, fences or wires (other than those approved for
bracing, guying or wrapping) shall be attached to any trees;
      (4)   No gaseous, liquid or solid substances which are harmful to trees
shall be permitted within the tree preservation area;
      (5)   No fire or heat shall be permitted within the tree preservation
area;
      (6)   Unless otherwise authorized by the tree removal permit, no soil is
to be removed from or placed upon the critical root zone of any tree that is to
remain; and
      (7)   All utilities, including service lines, shall be installed in
accordance with the tree preservation plan. Public utilities which have been
notified of the tree preservation plan shall be responsible for adhering to
said tree preservation plan during installation of necessary utility service
lines. Every effort shall be made to protect existing protected trees during
the placement of utility service lines including auguring and/or jacking as
opposed to open cutting as appropriate.
   (c)   Compliance. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation,
including public utilities, to fail to abide by the terms of any tree
preservation plan or tree removal permit issued by the city. If, in the opinion
of the city, the necessary precautions as specified in the tree preservation
plan were not undertaken before construction commenced or are not maintained at
any time during construction, a stop work order will be issued by the city
until such time as the permittee complies with these precautions. (Ord. 19-91.
Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.08 TREE REPLACEMENT.
   (a)   Tree Replacement Plan. A tree replacement plan prepared in
consultation with the City shall be required as part of the applications for a
tree removal permit and/or a certificate of zoning compliance. Tree
replacements shall be indicated on a plan, drawn to a scale of not less than 1"
= 50', which shows proposed locations and a plant list that specifies quantity,
species, installation size, and total replacement caliper inches. This plan
shall be approved by the Community Development Department or designee, and
shall include:
      (1)   The location, common name, and size of all replacement trees to be
planted on the site. If all required replacement trees cannot be accommodated
on site, the plan shall indicate where and how the applicant will replace the
balance of the required trees as outlined by this section.
   (b)    Protected Trees. Protected trees shall be replaced in accordance with
the following schedule and with trees described in (c) below:
      (1)   Protected trees having a trunk diameter breast height up to twelve
(12) inches are to be replaced on a one-for-one basis;
      (2)   Protected trees having a trunk diameter breast height of twelve
(12) inches up to eighteen inches are to be replaced on a two-for-one basis;
      (3)   Protected trees having a trunk diameter breast height of twelve
(12) inches up to eighteen inches are to be replaced on a two-for-one basis;
      (4)   Protected trees having a trunk diameter breast height of twenty-
four (24) inches up to thirty inches are to be replaced on a four-for-one
basis; and
      (5)   Protected trees having a trunk diameter breast height of thirty
(30) inches and over are to be replaced on a five-for-one basis.
   (c)    Replacement Trees. All replacement trees should be of a deciduous
species which is indigenous to the region and shall be made with new trees of
not less than two-and-one-half inch caliper, measured six (6) inches above the
ground level. Replacements shall be made within one year of the date of the
removal of any trees for which such replacement is required. All replacement
trees shall otherwise conform to the Landscape Code, Section
1151. See Section
1151.13, Table 25 for Prohibited Trees.
   (d)   Replacement Options. The intent of replacement of removed trees
overall is to maintain an equivalent tree canopy citywide before and after
removal/construction.
      (1)   On-Site Replacement Option. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the
required replacement trees shall be replanted in a location on the site from
which the original trees were removed to maintain the remaining natural
distribution of tree cover in the City.
      (2)   Tree Bank Fund Option. If On-Site Replacement, (d) (1) above,
cannot accommodate the required replacement trees, a payment in lieu of
replanting may be utilized, with fee rate to be determined by the City of
Zanesville. The replacement fee for each tree shall be allocated to the Tree
Bank Fund according to the schedule of fees established by Council. Tree Bank
Funds shall be used only for the planting and installation of trees on public
property at any location within the City, including in the right of way as
determined by the City in its sole discretion. Planting and installation may
include purchase, transportation, mulching, watering, and labor associated with
the replacement tree(s) for up to one year from the date of planting. An
Applicant who chooses this Replacement Option shall have no right of decision
in the location, type, or method of installation or maintenance of trees, as
the payment is a voluntary payment in lieu of planting the required caliper
inches of trees on site as given in replacement Option (d) (1).
      (3)   Replacement Schedule for Heavily Wooded Sites. In lieu of the
provisions in the Section above, the developer or owner of a heavily wooded
site, as defined herein, shall, during the course of development, be required
to retain or replace protected trees in accordance with the following
provisions:
         A.   Any lot with a minimum of seventy percent (70%) canopy coverage
is considered a heavily wooded site.
         B.   A minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the development site shall
remain under canopy coverage.
         C.   At the conclusion of development and installation of landscaping,
a sufficient number of large canopy trees shall have been planted or retained
so as to return the development site to the percentage of canopy coverage
existing prior to development. The canopy coverage shall be achieved over a
thirty year period.
      (4)   Additional Requirements. The requirement for tree canopy coverage
shall be considered as being in addition to any other landscaping required.
         A.   Failure to replace a protected tree or a canopy tree within one
year of the approval of the application is a violation of the Zoning Ordinance,
subject to penalty.
      (5)   Tree Replacements and Landscape Code. The tree replacement
requirements of this Chapter shall be in addition to the landscaping and
screening requirements of the Landscape Code. All replacements shall be
installed and maintained in accordance with the Landscape Code.
         A.   The required tree replacement plan shall be coordinated with all
landscaping required by the Landscape Code to achieve a cohesive landscape
treatment for the entire site.
            (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.09 DUTY OF PROPERTY OWNER TO PRUNE PLANTS ON PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning real property
bordering on any street upon which property there may be plants, trees or
shrubs, to prune, or cause to be pruned, such plants, trees or shrubs in such
manner that they will not obstruct or shade the street lights, obstruct the
passage of pedestrians on sidewalks or pathways, obstruct visibility of traffic
signs, obstruct visibility of or from any driveway, street, or alley
intersection, or generally obstruct vehicular traffic.
   
   (b)   Should any person or persons owning real property bordering on any
street fail to prune plants, trees, or shrubs as herein provided above, the
City shall order such person or persons within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of written notice, to so prune such plants, trees, or shrubs. The order shall
be served by hand delivery to the property owner or by mailing a copy of the
order to the last known address of the property owner by certified mail, return
receipt requested.
   (c)   When a person to whom an order is directed shall fail to comply within
the specified time, it shall be lawful for the city, its employees, or agents
to enter onto the property to prune such plants, trees, or shrubs and to bill
to the property owner the actual cost of the work incurred by the city. In
addition to paying the actual cost of the work, the property owner shall pay a
penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the actual cost of the work.
   (d)   If the property owner fails to pay for the actual cost of the work
and/or the penalty, city council may make a written return to the county
auditor of its action with a statement of the charges of its services, the fees
of the officers who made the service of the notice and return, and a proper
description of the premises. Such amounts, when allowed, shall be entered upon
the tax duplicate, shall be a lien upon such lands from the date of the entry,
and shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the city with the general
fund.
   (e)   Notices of violations of this section shall be served by certified
mail and/or by hand delivery to the property owner. (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-
19.)
1152.10 FLEXIBILITY.
   The standards and criteria in this Chapter establish the City's objectives
and the level of tree preservation expected. However, in applying these
standards, the Development Department, Shade Tree Commission, and City Council
may exercise discretion and flexibility with respect to the placement and
arrangement of required elements to assure that the objectives of this chapter
and the proposed development are best satisfied.
(Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)
1152.11 APPEALS.
   Any aggrieved property owners may appeal in writing to the Board of Zoning
Appeals any decision made by the city staff. (Ord. 19-91. Passed 9-9-19.)

1155.01 PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this chapter are intended for special situations in which:
   (a)   Adequate space, light, air and other objectives of this Zoning Code
relating to the public health, safety and welfare can be achieved without the
literal application of the detailed zoning and subdivision requirements
otherwise applicable; and
   (b)   Special amenities and benefits to the community beyond those required
by this and other City ordinances can be achieved by allowing more flexible
design than is otherwise permitted by such requirements.
   These objectives can be achieved where an area of land is planned for
development as an integrated unit and where its design is subject to more
detailed review and approval by the City than is normally required.
   The objective of Planned Unit Development (PUD) is therefore not simply to
allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations. It is instead to
encourage a higher level of design and amenity than it is possible to achieve
under the usual land development requirements.
   It is accordingly the intent of the City to suspend the application of
detailed zoning and subdivision standards as provided herein only where such
special amenity is achieved. In this way the City may grant the creative
developer a desirable flexibility and at the same time not only protect but
enhance the welfare of the residents and other users of a development as well
as the rest of the community.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1155.02 QUALIFICATION FOR FILING AS A PUD.
   (a)   No development shall be filed as a Planned Unit Development unless it:
      (1)   Is at least two acres in size; and
      (2)   Contains more than two detached buildings accommodating principal
uses; and
      (3)   Is initially under the same ownership or control.
   (b)   A Planned Unit Development may be residential, commercial, office,
industrial or a combination thereof. Flexibility to suspend requirements
imposed elsewhere is not conferred upon the PUD applicant as a matter of right
but is in all cases subject to a finding by the City that the objectives of
these provisions shall be served thereby.
(Ord. 17-02. Passed 2-13-17.)
1155.03 INCENTIVES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   To further a superior level of design and amenity in new developments, the
following incentives are offered in Planned Unit Developments:
   (a)   Variable Density and Dimensional Zoning Standards. Standards for
minimum lot area, minimum lot area per dwelling unit, lot width, building
height, floor area ratio, yard dimensions, off-street parking and loading,
landscaping and screening, fences and signs may vary from those established
elsewhere in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   More Than One Principal Building Per Lot. In a Planned Unit
Development more than one principal building may be located on a lot.
   (c)   Variable Subdivision Design Standards. Dimensional and design
standards for subdivisions and subdivision improvements such as streets,
blocks, sidewalks and parkways, but not improvement construction standards, may
vary from those established in the City Subdivision Regulations.
   (d)   Mixed Land Uses. Land uses other than those allowed as permitted or
conditional uses in the applicable zoning districts may be permitted on up to
thirty percent (30%) of the net site area of a Planned Unit Development.
      (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1155.04 REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Site Plan Review. Whether or not a land subdivision is involved,
preliminary and final plans for the development shall be filed and approved by
the City in conformance with the provisions of Table 2, Section
1113.14.
   (b)   Required Common Open Space. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the
net site area in residential use in each phase shall be set aside for permanent

1155.08 TABLE 31: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   In recommending approval or conditional approval of a preliminary or final
plan for a Planned Unit Development (PUD), the Planning Commission shall
transmit to Council written findings of fact that the application meets all of
the criteria below, or shall meet them when the Commission's conditions are
complied with. Council shall not be bound by the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, but in granting approval or conditional approval, Council shall
also find that all of the following criteria are met or shall be met when any
conditions to which the approval is made subject are complied with.
   (a)   Superior Design. The PUD represents a more creative approach to the
unified planning of development and incorporates a higher standard of
integrated design and amenity than could be achieved under otherwise applicable
zoning district and subdivision regulations, and solely on this basis
modifications to the use and design standards established by such regulations
are warranted.
   (b)   Meets PUD Requirements. The PUD meets the requirements for Planned
Unit Developments set forth in this Code, and no modifications to the use and
design standards otherwise applicable are allowed other than those permitted
herein.
   (c)   Consistent with City Plan. The PUD is generally consistent with the
objectives of the City Comprehensive Plan as viewed in light of any changed
conditions since its adoption.
   (d)   Public Welfare. The PUD shall not be detrimental to the public health,
safety, morals or general welfare.
   (e)   Compatible with Environs. Neither the PUD nor any portion thereof
shall be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other properties in its
vicinity, seriously impair property values or environmental quality in the
neighborhood, nor impede the orderly development of surrounding property.
   (f)   Natural Features. The design of the PUD is as consistent as practical
with the preservation of natural features of the site such as flood plains,
wooded areas, steep slopes, natural drainageways or other areas of sensitive or
valuable environmental character.
   (g)   Circulation. Streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bicycle paths, off-
street parking and off-street loading as appropriate to the planned land uses
are provided. They are adequate in location, size, capacity and design to
ensure safe and efficient circulation of automobiles, trucks, bicycles,
pedestrians, fire trucks, garbage trucks and snow plows as appropriate without
blocking traffic, creating unnecessary pedestrian-vehicular conflict, creating
unnecessary through traffic within the PUD, or unduly interfering with the
safety or capacity of adjacent streets.
   (h)   Open Spaces and Landscaping. The quality and quantity of common open
spaces and landscaping provided are consistent with the higher standards of
design and amenity required of a PUD. The size, shape and location of a
substantial portion of total common open space provided in residential areas
render it useable for recreation purposes.
   Open space between all buildings is adequate to allow for light and air,
access by fire fighting equipment and for privacy where walls have windows,
terraces or adjacent patios. Open space along the perimeter of the development
is sufficient to protect existing and permitted future uses of adjacent
property from adverse effects from the development.
   (i)   Covenants. Where individual parcels are to be later sold, adequate
provision has been made in the form of deed restrictions, homeowners or
condominium associations, or the like for:
      (1)   The preservation and maintenance of any open spaces, thoroughfares,
utilities, water retention or detention areas, and other common elements not to
be dedicated to the City or another public body; and
      (2)   Such control of the use and exterior design of individual
structures, if any, as is necessary for continuing conformance to the PUD plan,
such provision to be binding on all future ownership.
   (j)   Public Services. The land use, intensities and phasing of the PUD are
consistent with the anticipated ability of the City, the school system and
other public bodies to provide and economically support police and fire
protection, water supply, sewage disposal, schools and other public facilities
and services without placing undue burden on existing residents and businesses.
   (k)   Phasing. Each development phase of the PUD can, together with any
phases that preceded it, exist as an independent unit that meets all of the
foregoing criteria and all other applicable regulations herein even if no
subsequent phase should ever be completed. The provision and improvement of
public or common area improvements, open spaces and amenities--or the provision
of financial sureties guaranteeing their improvement--is phased generally
proportionate to the phasing of the number of dwelling units or amount of
nonresidential floor area.

1157.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this chapter is to provide for the continuation and,
under appropriate circumstances, elimination of existing uses of property that
do not conform to the requirements of this Zoning Code or that may not conform
to future amendments thereto.
   (b)   The provisions herein are designed to accomplish this intent in a way
that:
      (1)   Recognizes the rights and interests of owners of individual
properties that have been rendered nonconforming by City action to upgrade
zoning policies and standards;
      (2)   Allows the property owner or lessee to recover his or her
investment in the nonconformity, while also recognizing that by virtue of the
nonconformity he or she enjoys a special right not available to other property
owners in the same zoning district; and
      (3)   Minimizes the nuisance, reduction in neighboring property values
and other adverse effects of properties that do not conform to their environs.
         (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1157.02 TYPES OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (a)   A nonconformity is any characteristic of a building, structure or lot
or parcel of land, or of the use thereof, which was lawful prior to the date of
enactment of this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto but that does not
currently conform to the requirements thereof.
   (b)   The lawful issuance of a building permit prior to the dates specified
above shall be considered to establish the lawfulness of any building or
structure.
   (c)   There are three categories of nonconformities:
      (1)   Activity nonconformities. A property with an activity nonconformity
is being used for a purpose not allowed in its zoning district.
   Activity nonconformities are any activities or functions carried on at a
premises (as either a principal or accessory use) that are not allowed by the
permitted and conditional uses of the zoning district in which the premises is
situated, irrespective of the use for which the premises was designed.
   The use of a dwelling now located in a Residential District as the site of a
previously legal business is an example of an activity nonconformity. The
design of such a structure is conforming, but its use is not.
   The provisions herein recognize that activity nonconformities can generally
be eliminated more easily and at less cost than other kinds of nonconformities.
      (2)   Design nonconformities. A property with a design nonconformity was
designed for a purpose not allowed in its zoning district. Its present use may
or may not be for a purpose allowed in that district.
   A design nonconformity is the design or intended use of all or substantially
all of a premises for any principal or accessory use not allowed by the
permitted and conditional uses of the zoning district in which it is located,
irrespective of the nature of the activities currently carried on at that
premises.
   A previously legal premises now located in a Residential District that was
designed and intended as an automobile service station or an open sales lot,
would be an example of a design nonconformity, even if no service station or
sales business were currently operated on the premises. A store building in a
Residential District presently used as an elementary school would be another
example. In both cases the use or activity on the premises is conforming but
the design or appearance of the premises is not.
   The provisions herein recognize that design nonconformities are more
difficult and more costly to eliminate than activity nonconformities.
      (3)   Standards nonconformities. Standards nonconformities are all other
nonconformities with the requirements of this Code, including nonconformities
involving:
         A.   Yards;
         B.   Building height;
         C.   Lot area or lot area per dwelling unit;
         D.   Lot width;
         E.   Floor area ratio;
         F.   Off-street parking and loading;
         G.   Dimensions of signs;
         H.   Landscaping and screening; and
         I.   Fences.
   An undeveloped lot not meeting the minimum width required by its zoning
district, or an otherwise conforming business with a sign that does not meet a
requirement of the sign regulations, would be examples of standards
nonconformities.
   The provisions herein recognize that certain types of standards
nonconformities are difficult and costly to eliminate while other types can be
eliminated more easily and at relatively modest expense.
         (Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1157.03 ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   Properties with nonconformities shall be lawful uses hereunder, and may
continue unchanged without time limitation, but changes to such properties
shall be subject to the provisions of Table 32, Section
1157.07.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1157.04 APPROVAL CRITERIA.
   In granting or denying approval for changes involving properties with
nonconformities in conformance with Table 32, Section
1157.07, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be guided by the approval criteria
for conditional uses provided in Table 8, Section
1121.07 and shall find that after the proposed change is made the property is
not likely to conform to such criteria to a significantly lesser degree than
before the action was taken.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1157.05 CONDITIONAL OR INTERMITTENT USES.
   Conditional uses approved by the City shall not be considered to have
activity or design nonconformities but shall require an additional conditional
use permit for any alteration, enlargement or extension. The casual,
intermittent or temporary use of land or structures shall not be sufficient to
establish the existence of a nonconformity.
(Ord. 87-94. Passed 7-27-87.)
1157.06 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   A certificate of occupancy shall be required for the continuation of
all nonconformities created by this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto.
   (b)   When the City Zoning Administrator determines that a property has any
nonconformity, he or she shall notify the owner or lessee thereof of such
nonconformity and of the regulations applicable thereto.
   Such notice shall require that the recipient file with the Zoning
Administrator, within ninety days of the date thereof, either satisfactory
evidence that the property is not nonconforming or a completed application for
a certificate of occupancy to continue the nonconformity.
   Upon timely receipt of a complete and accurate application therefor, the
Zoning Administrator shall issue a certificate of occupancy for the
nonconforming property.
   (c)   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a file of all nonconformities
of which he or she has sent notice and of all nonconformities issued
certificates of occupancy.

   The procedures herein are intended to enforce the performance standards
herein, to protect businesses from arbitrary enforcement, and to protect the
public from unnecessary enforcement costs.
   (a)   New Uses. An application for a conditional use permit or a building
permit for an industrial use within the I-1 Industrial District shall include a
certification by a licensed engineer, licensed architect or scientific
laboratory that the use involved in the application is able to meet all
applicable performance standards to the extent that this can be judged based on
the submitted building plans and other information available prior to
construction.
      This certification shall be accompanied by copies of all data or
information supplied by the applicant and used as the basis of the
certification. The Zoning Administrator may refer the certification and data to
the Director of Public Service for review.
      The Zoning Administrator may also require such certification for a land
use in any other zoning district when in his or her judgment the use has
potential to exceed any performance standard herein. Such certification may
include all performance standards or only individual standards specified by the
Zoning Administrator.
   (b)   Existing Uses. In enforcing performance standards on existing uses,
the Zoning Administrator may issue a written notice of violation to an alleged
violator.
      The Zoning Administrator shall, before issuing such notice, make
technical determinations of violation when such determinations can be made
using equipment and trained personnel normally available to the City or
obtainable without extraordinary expense.
      In other cases, however, technical complexity or extraordinary expense
may make it unreasonable for the City to maintain personnel or equipment for
making determinations of violation prior to issuing a notice of violation. In
such cases, a notice of violation may be issued when the Zoning Administrator
has other reason to believe there is probable violation.
      The Zoning Administrator shall give notice of violation by any means that
ensures a signed receipt for such notice to the party responsible for the
alleged violation.
      The notice shall describe the alleged violation and the results of
technical determinations or the other reasons why the Zoning Administrator
believes there is a violation. The notice shall require either an answer or
correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator and within a time limit he or she shall specify in the notice.
      The notice shall also state that failure to provide an answer or correct
the alleged violation within this time limit shall constitute admission of a
violation.
      The notice shall further state that, if technical determinations have not
already been made, upon request of the alleged violator such determinations
shall be made. If a violation is found as a result of such determinations, the
cost of the determinations shall be assessed against the properties or parties
responsible in addition to any other penalties provided for. If no violation is
found, the City shall pay the cost of the determinations.

1163.01  PURPOSE.
   The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the design, placement,
and construction of telecommunications facilities in order to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
telecommunications marketplace in the City. Specifically, the purposes of this
Chapter are:
   (a)    To regulate the location of towers and other telecommunications
facilities in the City;
    (b)    To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of telecommunications facilities;
   (c)    To minimize adverse visual impact of telecommunications facilities
through careful design, siting, landscaping, and stealth techniques;
   (d)    To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower structures
to support telecommunications facilities;
   (e)    To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers and antenna
support structures as a primary option to construction of additional single-use
towers;
   (f)    To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and other
telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly designed,
constructed, and maintained, and are fully removed upon cessation of operation;
and
   (g)    To ensure that telecommunications facilities are compatible with
surrounding land uses.
      (Ord. 98-132. Passed 9-28-98.)
1163.02  APPLICABILITY.
   All towers, antenna support structures, antennas, and other
telecommunications facilities, any portion of which are located within the
City, are subject to this chapter. Except as provided in this chapter, any use
being made of an existing tower or antenna support structure on the effective
date of the ordinance enacting this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming
structure and allowed to continue, even if in conflict with the terms of this
chapter. Any tower site that has received approval in the form of a building
permit by the City, but has not yet been constructed or located, shall be
considered a nonconforming structure so long as such approval is current and
not expired.

than 750 feet to any residential zoning district.
       (3)    Towers greater than l50 feet in height, when permitted, shall be
located no closer than 1,000 feet to any residential zoning district. Towers
greater than 150 feet are not permitted unless the additional height is
necessary to:
         A.   Facilitate co-location of telecommunications facilities; or
         B.   Meet the coverage requirements of the applicant's grid system, to
be documented with written, technical evidence from an engineer that
demonstrates that the height of the tower is the minimum height required to
function satisfactorily, and no tower that is taller than such minimum height
shall be approved.
      (4)    Distance to residential zoning district requirements shall be one-
half (½) of the distances established above for towers incorporating stealth
design.
   (d)    Antennas may be mounted to existing towers or antenna support
structures under the following guidelines:
      (1)    Any such antenna and its supporting facilities that are mounted to
an existing structure shall be painted a color which matches, or is compatible
with, the structure on which it is located.
       (2)    Any antenna and supporting facilities located above the primary
roof of an antenna support structure shall be set back one foot from the edge
of the roof for each one foot in height that the antenna extends above the
primary roof of the structure. This setback requirement shall not apply to
telecommunications facilities which are screened from view through the use of
stealth design, panels, walls, fences, or other screening techniques approved
by the City.
       (3)    The height from grade of the antenna shall not exceed the height
from grade of the antenna support structure by more than 20 feet.
      (4)    Micro antennas not exceeding five feet in height may be placed on
any building in a permitted zoning district and shall not be subject to the
edge of roof setback requirements.
   (e)    All other uses accessory to any telecommunications facility,
including but not limited to business offices, maintenance depots, and
materials and vehicle storage are prohibited from the site unless otherwise
permitted in the zoning district in which the telecommunications facility is
located.
(Ord. 98-132. Passed 9-28-98.)
1163.05 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)    The applicant shall demonstrate, using the latest technological
evidence, that the telecommunication facility must be placed where it is
proposed in order to satisfy its necessary function in the applicant's grid
system. Part of the demonstration shall include a drawing showing the
boundaries of the area around the proposed location which would permit the
facility to function properly in the company's grid system.
   (b)    If the applicant proposes to build a tower (as opposed to mounting an
antenna on an existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has
contacted the owners of all tall structures within an appropriate zoning
district within a one-half (½) mile radius of the site proposed, asked for
permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for
either non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic demand was
made by the owner of the potential antenna support structure, based on
prevailing market values. "Tall structures" must be at least fifty feet in
height and shall include but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers,
buildings, antenna support structures of other telecommunications companies,
other towers, and roadway light poles.
   The City may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant
has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
   (c)    The applicant shall demonstrate that the telecommunications facility
is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily or to accommodate the
co-location requirement. No facility that is taller than the necessary height
shall be approved.
   (d)    The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed telecommunications
facility is safe and that the surrounding properties will not be negatively
affected by tower failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields
or radio frequency interference. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
proposed facility meets FCC radio frequency emission standards. Furthermore,
all towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as approved by the
manufacturer.
   (e)    A chain-link fence shall be required around any tower and its support
structures. The fence shall be a minimum of six feet in height and shall be
erected to prevent access to non- authorized personnel.
   (f)    In order to screen support structures, fencing, and other ground
level features and to soften the appearance of the site, any freestanding tower
shall incorporate landscaping which includes evergreen trees, shrubs, and other
landscaping vegetation. In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site
shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
   The City may permit any combination of vegetation, topography, walls,
decorative fencing or other features instead of landscaping if the same degree
of screening as the required landscaping is achieved.
   If an antenna is mounted on an existing structure and other related
equipment is housed inside of an existing structure, landscaping will not be
required.
   (g)    The applicant must demonstrate to the City that it is licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Towers built on speculation shall not
be permitted. At least one licensed user must be committed to placing its
facilities on a tower before the tower will be approved.
   (h)    Adequate parking shall be required for users of a tower such as
maintenance personnel. If the site is not fully automated, the number of
required parking spaces shall equal the number of employees working on the
largest shift. All parking facilities shall be consistent with the applicable
parking requirements established in the Zoning Code.
   (i)    Unless required otherwise by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) or the FCC, all towers shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or similar
color minimizing its visibility. Towers shall meet all FAA regulations. No
tower shall be lighted except when required by the FAA. No signs shall be
permitted on any telecommunications facility. All utility lines serving a tower
shall be underground.
   Any antenna that is mounted to an existing structure shall be painted a
color which matches, or is compatible with, the structure on which it is
located.
   (j)    The owner of property used as a site of a telecommunications facility
shall maintain such property and all structures in good condition and free of
trash, outdoor storage, weeds, and other debris.
(Ord. 98-132. Passed 9-28-98.)
1163.06  CO-LOCATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)    For the purpose of encouraging co-location of telecommunications
facilities and other uses, towers shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Towers less than seventy-five feet in height shall be designed,
engineered, and constructed to support facilities installed by two or more
telecommunications providers.
       (2)    Towers at least seventy-five feet in height but less than 150
feet in height shall be designed, engineered, and constructed to support
facilities installed by three or more telecommunications providers.
       (3)    Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed,
engineered, and constructed to support facilities installed by four or more
telecommunications providers.
   As used in the above, the term "providers" shall include the antennas of
police, fire and EMS departments. Furthermore, an applicant must demonstrate
that the area acquired for the use and construction of the tower and support
structures is sufficient in size to accommodate any additional structures that
may be required if additional providers are added to the tower.
   (b)    In order to reduce the number of towers needed in the City, the owner
of an existing tower shall not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other
users, including other telecommunications companies and the antenna of local
police, fire and EMS departments. The owner of an existing tower may request
reasonable compensation for the use of the tower.
   (c)    Authorization for a tower shall be issued only if there is not
technically suitable space reasonably available on an existing tower or
structure.
(Ord. 98-132. Passed 9-28-98.)
1163.07 ABANDONMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)    The owner of a telecommunications facility shall be required to
notify the City's Zoning Officer in writing of its intent within thirty days of
its cessation of business, discontinuance of service, or any transfer, merger,
or acquisition of ownership.
   (b)    If at any time the use of any telecommunications facility is
discontinued for 120 days, the Zoning Officer may declare the facility
abandoned. The 120 day period excludes any dormancy period between construction
and initial use of the facility. Discontinued shall mean that the facility has
not been properly maintained, has been abandoned, become obsolete, or is unused
for telecommunications purposes. The Zoning Officer shall serve the facility's
owner with a declaration of abandonment, with instructions to either reactivate
use of the facility or dismantle and remove the facility within sixty days from
the mailing of the notice.
   Service of said notice shall be by ordinary mail with return receipt to the
last known address of the owner and service shall be presumed if said receipt
is returned by the U.S. Post Office. If the notice is returned as undelivered,
the City shall post the notice on the facility for a period of thirty days. If
reactivation does not occur or dismantling is not commenced or dismantling is
not diligently pursued within the 60 day period and no appeal is filed as
provided in this section, the City may remove the facility or contract to have
the facility removed and assess to the operator and/or owner of the facility
the costs of removal.
   The notice of declaration of abandonment required by this section shall
inform the owner that it has the right to appeal the order to reactivate or
dismantle by filing a written notice of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals,
pursuant to Section
1105.13 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)    No telecommunications tower shall be constructed, replaced or altered
without first obtaining any applicable building permits.
(Ord. 98-132. Passed 9-28-98.)

CHAPTER 1165
Elimination of Spot Blight
1165.01    Legislative finding.
1165.02    Definitions.
1165.03    Determination of blighted premises.
1165.04    Public hearing.
1165.05    Acquisition and blight determination by City.
1165.06    Terms of sale; prohibition of recurrence of blight.
1165.07    Finances.
1165.08    Provisions of this chapter not limitaton.
1165.09    Severability.
1165.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   (a)   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City of
Zanesville properties that by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or the occurrence of criminal
activity which constitute public nuisances at the premises or combination
thereof constitute a blight and a nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood
because such premises are fire hazards, health hazards, places of retreat for
immoral or criminal purposes or for the breach of the public peace, substantial
and unreasonable interferences with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment
of other premises in the neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating
property values in the area.
   (b)   It therefore becomes necessary in order to eliminate nuisance and
blight and prevent recurrence of blight on the premises for the City to obtain
the title of the blighted premises and to take direct action to remove the
blight or provide for its removal by others and to make further provisions for
future development, redevelopment or use of the premises in such a way as to
prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the premises. It is further
found and determined that acquisition of such blighted property by the City in
order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent its recurrence constitutes
a public purpose.

      (Ord. 2024-30, Passed 2-26-24.)
1165.03  DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   (a)   The Community Development Director with the consent of the member of
Council in whose ward the premises is located, shall present to the Planning
Commission, from time to time and as circumstances warrant, findings which
shall list therein the location and ownership of premises which said Director
has reason to believe are blighted premises and which are located within the
City of Zanesville. The findings shall state briefly the factors which would
warrant the determination that the premises in the findings are blighted. The
premises so listed in the findings shall be only those blighted premises which,
in the opinion of the Director, are such that, in order to eliminate the
existing blight and to prevent future blight, acquisition thereof will be
necessary for one or more of the following reasons which shall be stated in the
findings:
      (1)    The owner of the blighted premises cannot or will not:
         A.    Eliminate the blighted condition, and/or
         B.    Prevent recurrence of the blighted condition.
      (2)    The owner of the blighted premises has not responded to a lawful
order by the City to take action to eliminate its recurrence within 30 days
after due notice of the request or order has been given by:
         A.    Posting such order or notice on the premises; or
         B.    Personal delivery; or
         C.    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address, as
listed in County property tax records, of the owner; or
         D.    Publishing in a newspaper of general circulation a notice of the
issuance of the order relating to the premises and directing the owner to
contact the Community Development Director in regard to such order.
      (3)    Direct action, short of acquisition by the City to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition of blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful.
      (4)    In the opinion of the director requesting the determination based
upon conditions existing on the premises and in the neighborhood, such direct
action would be likely to prove inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent its
recurrence.
   (b)    For purposes of subsection (a)(1) hereof, it shall be prima facie
evidence that the
owner of the blighted premises is unwilling or unable to eliminate or prevent
the recurrence of the blighted condition of the premises if:
      (1)    The blighted premises has been condemned; or
      (2)    The blighted premises is a vacant lot which has been cited by the
Community Development Director more than three times in a one year period or
where the City has had to maintain the lot at least twice during a one year
period; or
      (3)    The blighted premises has been used on more than two occasions
during a one year period as the site for the commission of criminal acts which
constitute a public nuisance.
   The owner's unwillingness or inability to eliminate or prevent the
recurrence of the blighted condition of the premises may also be established
through testimony and documentary evidence of the Planning Commission hearings
on the finding.
   (c)   Upon the finding of blight by the Planning Commission, the property
owner will be notified as described under Section
1165.04.
   (d)   The Planning Commission will make a recommendation to Council that the
property is blighted, and the Community Development Director will send
legislation to Council.
   (e)   The property owner will be notified as described under Section
1165.04 that a public hearing will be held prior to the third and final reading
of the legislation.
(Ord. 2024-30. Passed 2-26-24.)
1165.04  PUBLIC HEARING.
   Council shall set a date for public hearing in regard to the existence of
blight on the premises and the necessity for acquisition of the premises by the
City in order to eliminate blight and prevent the recurrence thereof. Said
hearing shall be held prior to the third reading of the ordinance by Council.
Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing, the Clerk of Council shall
promptly cause notice to be given to the owner or owners of record of the
premises and the known occupants thereof, if any, or the known person in charge
of the premises, if any, notifying them of the time and place of the hearing
and apprising them of their right to appear at such hearing to show cause why
the premises should not be declared to be blighted or why the City should not
acquire said premises for the purpose of eliminating blight thereon and
preventing the recurrence of blight.
   Notice of such hearing shall be given by:
   (a)    Posting the notice thereon on the premises; or
   (b)    Personal service; or
   (c)    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the owner
or owners of record of the premises or person known in charge of the premises
or to known occupants thereof; or
   (d)    Publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within
the City of Zanesville.
   (e)    At the required public hearing, the legislation shall be read and
shall constitute prima facie evidence of blight on the premises and the need
for the City to acquire such premises in order to eliminate the blight and
prevent recurrence of blight thereon. Thereafter, the owner or owners, person
in charge, occupant of the premises or any person having an interest therein
may proceed to show cause why the premises should not be declared blighted or
the City should not acquire said premises for the purposes of eliminating
blight or preventing its recurrence. At the hearing, the owner or owners,
person in charge of the premises or occupant may cause to be presented to the
committee or committees of Council any records of the City pertaining to issues
relevant to the hearing and may examine City employees in regard thereto;
provided that the production of such records or the presence of such employees
is required by the owner or owners, person in charge or occupant of the
premises in writing at least 24 hours prior to the hearing.
   (f)    If the owner or owners, person in charge or occupant of the premises
does appear and presents testimony for the purpose of showing cause why the
premises should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire the
premises for the purposes of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence
of blight, the director requesting the legislation, or designated
representatives, shall proceed to present evidence to Council of the existence
of blight on the premises and the need to acquire the premises for elimination
of the blight and the prevention of the recurrence of the blight thereon.
Members of the general public residing in he neighborhood or who may otherwise
have knowledge of the condition of such premises may address the committee or
committees at the public hearing in regard to the proposed action by the City.
Council may adjourn the public hearing, from time to time, and grant
continuances in order that further argument or evidence can be presented in
regard to the existence of blight on the premises or the need for the City to
acquire the premises in order to eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence of
blight thereon.
      (Ord. 2024-30. Passed 2-26-24.)

1167.01 TITLE.
   This code shall be known, cited and referred to as: The City of Zanesville
Downtown Design and Exterior Maintenance Code.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Downtown Design & Exterior Maintenance Code is to
preserve and enhance the economic vitality and viability of Downtown
Zanesville. In doing so, the Downtown Design & Exterior Maintenance Code
provides for the further implementation in the economic enhancement strategies
of the Downtown Zanesville Master Plan 1995, prepared by HyettPalma, Inc. The
Code makes exterior maintenance and building method recommendations based on
those strategies. It also encourages the establishment of an open dialogue
between the Downtown Design Review Board and the developer during the planning
stages of the project. The Downtown Design Review Board should work with
applicants in a cooperative manner to encourage quality oriented development,
while remaining sensitive to the needs and wishes of the applicant.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.03 REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Minimum Requirements. The provisions herein shall, in their
interpretation and application, be held to be minimum requirements.
   (b)    More Restrictive Requirement Applies. Except as otherwise provided
herein, in any case in which any portion of this chapter or any other City
ordinance, or any law, regulation, or any private agreement, covenant or
easement applying within the City, establishes a requirement that is either
more or less restrictive than a particular requirement established herein, the
provision that is the more restrictive or that imposes the higher standard or
requirement shall govern. (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.04 VARIANCES.
   The Downtown Design Review Board may grant variances from the literal
application of the provisions herein where such application to a particular
property would cause hardship or practical difficulties. Variance requests to
all other provisions of the City Zoning Code shall be heard by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.05 APPEALS.
   (a)    Applicability. Any party aggrieved by an administrative order or
decision made under this Code by any authorized administrative official may
appeal that order or decision to the Downtown Design Review Board. Appeals of
decisions of the Downtown Design Review Board shall be made to the Board of
Zoning Appeals under the provisions for appeals of the Zoning Code (Section
1105.13).
   (b)    Appeal Process. Appeals shall be decided only in conformance with the
approval process provided in Chapter
1105 and the design guidelines herein.
   (c)    Stay of Proceedings. The filing of a notice of appeal shall stay all
proceedings of the action appealed unless the authorized administrative
official issuing the order/decision certifies to Downtown Design Review Board
that, in his or her judgement, a stay would cause immediate peril to life,
health or property. In such case, no proceedings shall be stayed without
issuance of a restraining order by the Downtown Design Review Board or a court
of record.
   (d)    Hearing and Action. Upon receipt, the Zoning Administrator shall
transmit the notice of appeal and the complete record of the decision to the
Downtown Design Review Board. Public hearing on the appeal shall be at the next
available Review Board meeting.
   After the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall within thirty (30) days
take final action on the appeal, whereby it may affirm, reverse or modify the
action being appealed, subject only to judicial review in the Court of Common
Pleas in accordance with applicable state statutes. To this end, the Board
shall have all the powers of the party from which the appeal was taken and may
direct the issuance of a permit.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.06 AMENDMENTS.
   To adapt to changing development conditions and provide for the phased
implementation of the Downtown Master Plan, the Downtown Design Review Board,
in conjunction with the Planning Commission, may from time to time recommend,
and Council may adopt, amendments to the provisions of this Code as provided by
the Ohio Revised Code.
   Amendments to this Code shall be approved only in conformance with the
approval process provided in Chapter
1113.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1167.07 FILING SUBMISSIONS.

guidance it provided at this preliminary hearing.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1171.06 MODIFICATION OF OTHER CODES.
   The Downtown Design Review Board's decision on an application shall not
modify the particular allowances and prohibitions of the Zoning Code,
Subdivision Regulations, Building Code or other development controls except as
specifically authorized herein to achieve a more satisfactory design.
   Except as explicitly authorized herein, the Board shall not disallow a land
use, land use intensity, building height or other characteristic of development
that is allowed by the Zoning Code, nor allow a use or development standard
disallowed by the Zoning Code. The Board may recommend to Council amendments to
such other codes or regulations that it believes are necessary to achieve
design objectives.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1171.07 DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA.
   In granting Design Approval or Conditional Design Approval, the Downtown
Design Review Board shall prepare written findings of fact that the proposed
alteration or change is compatible, as applicable, with the character of:
   (a)   The existing property being altered; and
   (b)   Surrounding properties; and
   (c)   Adjacent public ways; and
   (d)   The Downtown Master Plan district in which the property is located.
      (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1171.08 PROJECT REVIEW.
   Assisting the Downtown Design Review Board is the Staff of the Community
Development Department. Located on the second floor at City Hall, the
Department Staff is available to meet with property owners/developers to review
their downtown improvement project and to assist them through the Board review
process.
   (a)   Categorizing Your Exterior Project. No matter which exterior project
you have in mind, it involves either maintenance or exterior change. The Review
Chart on the following page contains some common examples of both types of
projects.
      (1)   Repair: is the routine work to maintain your building or site by
protecting existing features. Examples include fixing a door or reglazing a
window. Before beginning work, meet with the Zoning Administrator in the
Community Development Department to see if the repair work involves in-kind
replacement or significant exterior change.
      (2)   In-kind replacement: involves replicating a deteriorated part with
one of the same material, design, arrangement, texture, or color. Before
beginning work, consult with the Community Development Department to review
your replacement project.
      (3)   Exterior change: includes alterations, new construction, additions,
demolition, major site work, landscaping, fencing, or signage. For these
projects, you must apply for design approval from the Downtown Design Review
Board.

1173.01 PURPOSE.
   The Downtown Design Review Board shall consider the design guidelines in the
following sections when reviewing any action made subject to its review. Such
compatibility shall be judged with respect to the following design review
guidelines. It is not the intent of these guidelines to prohibit contemporary
design or architectural styles as may be compatible with the downtown
environment. (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1173.02 STOREFRONTS.
   The storefront is one of the most important components of an older
commercial building. Traditionally, it was valued for its commercial appeal and
for its ability to draw customers into the building. It was designed to work in
harmony with the upper facade of the building to form a cohesive whole. Often,
however, the storefront is the part of the building that is changed the most.
In downtown Zanesville, there are several examples of late 19th and early 20th
century storefronts which have had minor or no changes made. Some examples have
had parts of the storefront either removed or covered up. Other downtown
storefronts have been removed entirely and replaced with modern materials.
   (a)   While each storefront is different, there are typical storefront
treatments that characterized Zanesville's traditional commercial buildings.
These same rules should guide storefront design and rehabilitation today.
      (1)   An emphasis on transparency. Large expanses of display windows and
transoms are used to admit light into a typically windowless commercial space.
      (2)   A feeling of containment. The storefront is contained within the
space intended for it. The opening is usually framed by a horizontal beam above
and piers at each end.
      (3)   An entrance which draws you in. Entry doors in the storefront may
be flush, but are often recessed to provide more display window area. Often a
separate entry door is used to gain access to upper floors.
      (4)   An emphasis on compatibility. The storefront has a character which
is appropriate to the building's architectural style.
Storefront design evolved and underwent changes between the time that downtown
Zanesville's first commercial buildings were built in the early 1800's to
around 1940. Typical features of the downtown's 19th century storefronts
include large display windows flanking a recessed single or double door, with
stone or cast iron columns providing support. The display windows were raised
off the sidewalk by wood or metal panels known as bulkheads. A transom window
often existed above the door. The horizontal lintel over the storefront usually
contained the store's sign.
After the turn of the century, storefronts typically employed large transom
windows across the entire front. Metal framing and trim began to be used in the
display windows, giving the storefront a light and airy feel. During the 1920's
and 1930's, innovations in storefront design included the use of curved glass,
deeply-recessed entries, floating display islands, metal panels, and ceramic
tile used in the bulkheads or other parts of the storefront.
   (b)   Recommendations for Storefronts.
      (1)   Sometimes cleaning and maintenance is all that is needed to enhance
the original storefront's appearance. Try to change as little of the original
storefront as possible.
      (2)   Removal of original storefront materials such as wooden bulkhead
panels, original plate glass, stone or cast iron columns and piers, transom
glass, original doors, and trim is not recommended. Make every effort to
preserve such elements, even if they are not complete storefronts. Changes in
size or area of original storefronts are not recommended.
      (3)   Stark, plain, or unattractive altered storefronts can sometimes be
softened by simple and inexpensive efforts, such as painting, new signage, or
installing canvas awnings. Another option is to restore an altered storefront
to its original appearance, or as close to the original as is possible.
      (4)   Wood-shingled mansards, blank metal panels, diagonal siding, and
board-and-batten surfaces would not have been used traditionally in storefront
design and are therefore discouraged.
      (5)   "Theme restorations" (i.e. Tiffany, Colonial, Mediterranean,
Bavarian, Wild West) and the use of ornate doorways, varnished surfaces,
stained glass, and other similar features to make a storefront look older or
more decorative should be avoided. Any reconstruction of a storefront should be
based on physical evidence or historic photographs of the building.
      (6)   Buildings with multiple storefronts should be unified through the
use of architecturally compatible materials, colors, details, awnings, signage,
and lighting fixtures. All sides of a building should be architecturally
consistent with the front facade and storefront.

1173.03 UPPER FACADES/EXTERIOR WALLS.
   (a)   Much of the streetscape in downtown Zanesville is defined by the upper
facades of its buildings. The upper facades provide rhythm and architectural
character through the pattern of window openings, type of windows,
ornamentation, detail, and roofline treatments. Brick is the most commonly used
material on the upper facades in downtown Zanesville.
   Some commercial and institutional buildings also feature stone exterior
walls and extensive use of stone details. Stone has been used for the sills,
lintels and hoodmolds surrounding windows in brick upper facades. Some sills,
lintels, and hoodmolds are carved with geometric or floral patterns. Stone
masonry is generally left unpainted.
   Masonry exterior walls are also found on the sides and rear of downtown
buildings. In some cases, the type and quality of the masonry changes from
front to side to rear. Higher quality, more expensive and attractive brickwork
was commonly used on the streetside facades of downtown buildings. The rear, or
sides of a building that would not normally be seen by the public, would be
finished in less expensive, more utilitarian brickwork.
   Some exterior walls have been painted to protect low-quality brick from the
weather. Elsewhere, brick walls were painted to cover damaged masonry or wall
alterations. This is more frequently seen in the rear or non-public sides of
buildings in downtown Zanesville.
   (b)   Recommendations for Upper Facades/Exterior Walls.
      (1)   If cleaning of masonry is undertaken, begin with the gentlest
effective technique - try scrubbing with a natural bristle brush and plain
water before using potentially harmful and more expensive detergents or
chemicals. Consult with a professional cleaner before using more powerful
cleaning methods.
      (2)   Power washing is generally the least expensive method to
effectively clean masonry surfaces. Moderate pressure of no more than 300
pounds per square inch should be used. Choose a reliable professional who is
familiar with testing and cleaning procedures.
   Power washing at moderate and high pressure may remove mortar from joints.
Lower pressure water-wash methods should be used in areas where mortar joints
and caulking around windows are loose or deteriorated, unless they will be
replaced later.
      (3)   Only as a last recourse should any masonry be sandblasted and then
only with the approval of the Downtown Design Review Board. Sandblasting and
other abrasive cleaning methods, such as blasting with corn cobs, walnut
shells, or glass beads, remove a brick's hard outer crust. When the outer crust
has been removed, the brick is unable to withstand the effects of moisture and
weathering.
Sandblasting and other abrasive cleaning methods will pit and roughen stone
surfaces. This dulls and damages the detailing on the stone surfaces,
especially intricately carved stone. Sandblasting also creates a roughened
surface area on which dirt will more easily collect. For these reasons,
sandblasting of masonry surfaces is not recommended.
      (4)   Avoid masonry sealers, such as silicone, that will keep out liquid
water but not water vapor. Once it penetrates the masonry, moisture can be
trapped in the wall and deteriorate both interior and exterior surfaces.
      (5)   Painted masonry buildings should generally be left painted. The
paint may protect soft masonry or cover damaged or unattractive masonry.
Masonry that has not been painted in the past should not be painted, especially
window lintels, sills, and other details that are stone.
      (6)   When re-pointing or repairing brick masonry, take care to match the
original mortar mix. A mortar with too much cement may be so hard that it
causes the softer brick to crack apart. An acceptable mortar mix for softer
19th century brickwork is three to five parts of sand, one part of lime, and no
more than one-half part of Portland cement.
      (7)   A quality masonry re-pointing job includes matching the mortar by
color, texture, and composition. Skilled masons took pride in the original
tooling, or finishing, of the mortar joints. These joints are an important part
of each brick wall's design and should be matched in any re-pointing job.
         (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1173.04 DECORATIVE FEATURES ON UPPER FACADES.
   A distinguishing characteristic of downtown Zanesville's upper facades is
the decorative treatments found at or near the roofline. One of these
treatments is wood or metal cornices. These type of cornices are traditionally
painted for maintenance reasons and to provide a finisher "crown" to the upper
facade.
   Another decorative treatment is brick or stone parapets. A parapet is the
portion of the upper wall that rises above the roofline. It often is the
decorative cap to the building. Some downtown buildings display the building's
name and date in the parapet area.
   Some downtown buildings, particularly non-retail structures such as the
Muskingum County Courthouse and the Old Post Office, make use of decorative
features that represent a particular architectural style. In these buildings,
the upper facades display columns, pilasters, balconies, and stylized materials
that are not found on other downtown buildings.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1173.05 WINDOWS ON UPPER FACADES.
   (a)   The amount of detail associated with those windows in the upper facade
can vary. The most simple form would be double-hung windows in plain, lightly
decorated walls. A more ornate form would involve arched windows with heavily
decorated hoodmolds over the windows and decorated sills below the windows.
   Past alterations to windows in upper facades included covering them with
plywood, filling them in with brick or glass block, or installing new windows
which were the wrong size for the opening or wrong style for the building. Some
upper facades have been completely obscured by metal panels.
   (b)   Recommendations for Decorative Features.   
      (1)   Preserve and maintain decorative brickwork, stone treatments,
brackets, and wood or metal cornices that exist on downtown buildings. Maintain
existing stone or concrete lintels, hoodmolds, and sills, or replace in-kind.
      (2)   Decorative building parapets should not be removed. If a parapet
appears to be deteriorated, first evaluate what steps may be taken to secure
and preserve it. Its removal would not only damage the building's architectural
character, but could also cause serious problems for the roof's drainage
system.
      (3)   If an upper facade has been covered over, consider removing the
covering to expose the original architecture underneath. Damage which may have
been done to the upper facade should be repaired to the greatest extent
possible.
      (4)   Avoid adding cornices, brackets, hoodmolds, balconies, or bay
windows to buildings which never had them. Any reconstruction of decorative
features should be based on physical evidence or historic photographs of the
building. (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)

1173.06 ROOFS, GUTTERS, AND DOWNSPOUTS.
   (a)   Roofs, gutters, and downspouts affect your building's appearance. In
addition, a well-maintained roof and drainage system can preserve your downtown
building and prevent interior moisture problems. Preventive maintenance can not
only preserve original design features, but can also avoid potentially costly
replacements.
   Routine inspections and gutter cleaning are essential to the building's
continuing structural integrity. Remove leaves, branches, and debris from
gutters regularly. If screens are installed on the gutters, clean off the
screens. When it rains, watch to see if the downspouts are clear. Once they are
plugged up, they may freeze and burst.
   Also, inspect the gutter and downspout support brackets to be sure they are
secure. When downspout support brackets become loose, refasten them in the
mortar joints, instead of on brick or stone surfaces. Refasten the gutter
support straps under roofing materials, and not on the roof surface. If
necessary, keep these brackets painted to avoid rust-stained walls and
foundations.
   (b)    Recommendations for Roofs, Gutters and Downspouts.
      (1)   In repairing roofs, new work should match the original in
materials, texture, and color. If it is necessary to remove an original roof,
the basic roof shape should not be altered. New roofing should match the color,
size, and texture of the original roofing material.
      (2)   Where gutters and downspouts need replacement, care should be taken
to match the original in material, type, and detail. Try to make necessary new
guttering as inconspicuous as possible by painting it a neutral or background
color.
      (3)   Retaining and repairing box and stop gutters, or box gutters built
into the cornice is recommended. These are important design elements. To repair
leaky box or stop gutters, reline them with rolled membrane roofing.
      (4)   Flashing around chimneys and at parapets should be done in a manner
that is generally inconspicuous. Copper flashing left to weather naturally, or
tin sheet metal and metal roofing material painted a flat, neutral color are
recommended.
         (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)

1173.07 PAINT COLOR.
   Traditionally, for buildings of particular eras, certain types of colors are
more appropriate than others. In downtown districts, the buildings themselves
can provide a built-in color scheme through the natural color of their
materials.
   Downtown Zanesville is comprised primarily of masonry buildings. Brick
masonry colors can range from light orange-red to dark red. Brick can also be
found in lighter yellow or darker brown colors. Stone or concrete masonry can
range from cool grey colors to richer cream or white colors. Colors that are
added should complement the character of the individual building, the
neighboring buildings, as well as the downtown area as a whole.
   Color can be introduced in downtown areas in a variety of ways. It can be
through the building material itself, through paint colors added to
storefronts, window trim and doors, and through attachments to buildings such
as awnings and signage. Traditionally, different styles of architecture and
periods of building favored certain combinations of trim colors. The following
groupings are provided as an initial guide to color choices.
   (a)   Early Victorian (1830 - 1870). Structures built prior to 1870 used
light earth tones such as grays, yellows, and tans, as well as light reds and
light browns. Trim colors would have also been light earth tones compatible
with the natural brick-red walls of many of the buildings. Typically, no more
than three colors would have been used on any buildings of this type.
   (b)   Late Victorian/Italianate (1870 - 1910). After 1870, Italianate
commercial structures typical of the late Victorian period added noticeably
darker colors. Greens, darker reds, orange-reds; and olives could be found.
Almost always, the trim was painted in a darker color to complement the lighter
body color of the building. Light colors, sometimes white, would be used to
highlight special architectural details on the facade.
   (c)   Classical Revival (1890 - 1930). Colors used on these type of
buildings reflected a return to a more classical orientation. Subdued colors
such as cream, light yellow, and white were used on the body and trim. Bolder
highlight colors, like golds or greens, could be used to accent details.
   (d)   Art Deco and Modernistic Style (1920 - to Present). Buildings falling
into this style typically used colors that were light and subdued. Light-
colored stone, brick, or terra cotta were sometimes used in these buildings,
and paint colors were chosen to complement the natural color of these
materials. The natural patina of any original metal surfaces can guide the
color choice.
   (e)   Recommendations for Paint Color.
      (1)   Always choose colors that blend well with the natural color of your
building's unpainted brick or stone. Colors chosen should be appropriate to the
time period of the building's construction. If the building is frame, or is
already painted, colors should be selected that will blend with the overall
colors that already exist downtown.
      (2)   Avoid painting surfaces that have never been painted. Stone and
brick should generally be left unpainted, unless it has been painted in the
past (See Upper Facades).
      (3)   Paint can be used to soften the appearance of modern facade
treatments, such as veneers, permastone, or aluminum coverings.
      (4)   Choose a color scheme that will tie all of the parts of your
building together visually. For instance, the colors used in the storefront
should be repeated in the upper story windows or cornice area.
         (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1173.08 ENTRANCES AND DOORS.
   (a)   Primary storefront entries in downtown Zanesville are often recessed
from the front face of the building. Some primary entries are located at the
corner to gain maximum pedestrian exposure. Primary storefront entrances
traditionally used tall doors with full glazing. The doors could be used
individually or in pairs and often had glass transoms above them.
   Secondary doors are most often used to provide access to the upper floors or
the rear of the building and were simple in design. They could be either
recessed or flush with the rest of the building. Secondary entrances
traditionally used full or half-panel windows or solid wood panels. If a
secondary door is part of a front elevation, it is an important part of the
storefront design.
   (b)   Recommendations for Entrances and Doors.   
      (1)   Maintain the locations of existing entrances. They often reflect an
original or significant location. Retain the original size of the doors and
their openings.
      (2)   Retain important entrance features, such as steps, railings,
fencing, ornamental door surrounds, and lighting fixtures.
      (3)   If an entrance will no longer be used, consider leaving the door in
place rather than removing and filling in with glass or other materials. A
small sign could be used to indicate that another door is to be used.
      (4)   Keep replacement doors simple in design, unless historical evidence
indicates otherwise. Avoid adding false "historic" elements to a door, such as
crossbuck doors, pediments, or ornate grilles.
      (5)   On main or side facades, secondary entrance doors should be
compatible with the main storefront entrance.

It is important not to overlook a historic building's secondary entrances,
which may be placed on the main facade or along a rear or side wall. As this
doorway illustrates, these entrances often received nearly as much attention to
detail as the main entrances. In this example, an additional tall transom
provides natural light for an interior stairway.

1173.09 WINDOWS.
   (a)   Traditionally, downtown Zanesville buildings contain windows on the
upper facade. The amount of detail associated with those windows varies. The
most simple form would be double-hung windows in simple, lightly decorated
walls. A more ornate form would involve arched windows with heavily decorated
hoodmolds over the windows and decorated sills below the windows.
   Some past alterations to windows in upper facades included covering them
with plywood, filling them in with brick or glass block, or installing new
windows which were the wrong size for the opening or wrong style for the
building. Some upper facades have been completely obscured by a covering.
   (b)   Recommendations for Windows.
      (1)   Maintain the size and proportions of window openings. Avoid
changing the size of an opening to accommodate a smaller or larger window. A
change in size or proportion can result in altering the appearance of the
entire building facade.
      (2)   Replacement windows should replicate the original windows. Where
original windows are beyond repair and new ones are needed, they should match
the original in size, style, and number and pattern of glass panes.
      (3)   Blocking or covering window openings is not recommended. Where
blocking for privacy is necessary, explore alternative ways to achieve the same
ends, such as interior screening. Exterior shutters might also be used.
      (4)   Place new openings with care. New window openings on the front of a
building represent a radical change to its appearance. Look for places on the
alley side facade or rear of the structure, where a new window will be less
noticeable from the street. New windows should relate to existing windows in
scale, size, proportion, style, and placement.
      (5)   Traditionally, downtown buildings have used clear glass in windows.
Bronze or reflective glass is not recommended for existing buildings.
      (6)   Storm windows are an appropriate means of protecting windows from
the weather as well as conserving energy. The major divisions of the storm
windows should match the divisions on the windows being covered. Exterior storm
windows provide the most protection, but interior storm windows can also be
used.

These one-over-one double-hung sash windows, clustered in groups of three,
represent typical late 19th century practice. The window proportions, weight of
sash members, and glazing patterns all were consciously chosen by the architect
as part of the design and should not be altered during repair or
rehabilitation.
1173.10 SIGNS.
   Signs play an important role in a commercial area like downtown Zanesville.
A sign is used to make customers aware of a business' location and purpose. In
an effort to attract attention, signage may be inappropriately sized and placed
on downtown buildings. Signs which might work well for highway development,
where customers speed by in cars, are inappropriate for the slower traffic and
the more pedestrian scale of buildings in the downtown.
   Downtown commercial buildings often provide clues as to the form and
location an appropriate sign should take. Signage was frequently integrated
into the design of the storefront or the front facade of the building. The
space above the storefront was often reserved for a wall sign or for an
attachment for a projecting sign. Display windows were sometimes used for
painted window signs. In addition, awnings also provided a location for
business signage.
   (a)   General Sign Standards. All signs in the Design Improvement Area shall
be subject to the restrictions on number, area, height, maintenance, location,
illumination and other items provided in Chapter
1153.
   (b)   Recommendations for Signage.
      (1)   Appropriate signage in downtown Zanesville should take its cues
from the architectural character of the building. The sign should not dominate
the facade or conceal architectural features of the storefront or upper facade.
      (2)   Simple and clear graphics are encouraged to effectively communicate
the image of a business. Although common geometric forms, such as a rectangle,
square, circle, or oval, are recommended, other signage shapes may also be
appropriate.
      (3)   The supports for projecting signs should be considered part of the
overall sign design. A simple metal bracket would be most appropriate for
projecting signs.
      (4)   Sign colors should take cues from the building and its trim.
Bright, primary colors are best used as accents, while more subdued colors
should dominate. Signage color schemes should be simple, with a maximum of four
colors used on an individual sign.

GUIDELINES FOR SIGN PLACEMENT ON FACADES

To maximize the effectiveness of signage, it should always be considered a
complementary part of the structure. Because the signage is rendering (A) is
placed too high, it blocks the second floor windows. It seems out of line with
the structure's basic lines. Rendering (B) becomes more complimentary to these
lines. When placed within the transom area (C), the signage becomes "framed" by
the sidewalls and lintel. This approach is effective when the "frame" of a
storefront is rather high. Being closer to the street, it also becomes more
useable to pedestrian movement. When individually applied letters occur within
the lintel (D), this treatment enhances and respects the structure's
architecture.

Signboards physically attached to a building are among the earliest types of
signage and are still popular today. Sometimes such signs were detailed with
ornate shapes and border elements, as in this example, while others were very
plain and without ornamentation. Sign lettering sometimes was painted on and
sometimes consisted of raised letters. Colors usually were chosen for
compatibility with the colors of the building where the sign was mounted.

CHAPTER 1175
Design Guidelines for New Construction
1175.01   Purpose.
1175.02   Overall building form.
1175.03   Facade appearance.
1175.04   Site plan arrangements.
1175.05   New construction chart.
 
1175.01 PURPOSE.
   New construction should respond to the existing built environment. In the
planning of new construction in downtown Zanesville, design elements play an
important role and should be carefully considered. In both new buildings and
additions, certain design elements tend to reinforce an area's attractiveness
and are of particular importance.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1175.02 OVERALL BUILDING FORM.
   New construction should be similar in form, scale, massing, and material to
those typical and traditional in downtown Zanesville. The architectural design
of new buildings and additions should balance both the old and the new. New
buildings should not simply be copies of old ones. However, they can look to
buildings of the past for ideas on design elements such as windows,
proportions, cornices, parapets, storefronts, and ornamentation. Good design
can take advantage of modern technology and meet modern needs, while still
remaining compatible with older buildings.
   (a)    Height: New construction should observe typical and traditional
building heights. Sudden height variations, both higher and lower, can disrupt
the continuity of the streetscape.
   (b)    Massing: This refers to the basic shapes of buildings and how they
fit together. For most downtown Zanesville buildings, the massing is fairly
simple and generally consists of plain, rectangular shapes. In designing a new
structure, try to use Massing similar to the adjacent and nearby buildings.
   (c)    Proportion: Proportion is the relationship between a building width
and height. It also refers to the relationship between the parts of a building
to the whole. This varies throughout downtown Zanesville. In new building
design, use proportions similar to those found in adjacent and nearby
buildings.
   (d)    Scale: this refers to the size of a building in relation to that of a
person. In downtown Zanesville, nearly every building has a pedestrian scale
that is inviting to people. The same effect is encouraged in any new
construction.
   (e)    Roof Shade: Flat roofs, with slight slopes for drainage, are common
in downtown Zanesville commercial buildings. Flat roofs used in combination
with parapet walls and cornices are compatible with the traditional
architecture found in downtown Zanesville. Residential roof shapes such as
mansard, gambrel, or gable should be avoided in non-residential construction.
   (f)    Materials, Textures. and Colors: New designs should reflect the
predominant and traditional materials, textures, and colors found in downtown
Zanesville. Materials include wood, brick, stone, stucco, and concrete.
Textures include smooth painted wood, rough and smooth brick, rough and smooth
concrete, and smooth stone trim. As was mentioned previously in the section on
paint color, colors range from natural masonry materials to the painted trim
elements found on the building facade. In new construction, consider using
traditional materials with varying textures that are part of the building's
overall design.
      (Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1175.03 FACADE APPEARANCE.
   Windows and doors in new buildings and additions should be rectangular and
vertically oriented, or taller than wide in shape. For new construction,
appropriate proportions can be developed from surrounding buildings. In the
case of an addition, the existing building should be used as the guide.
   (a)    Entrances and Doors: Use surrounding buildings as a guide in the
placement of entrances and doors in new construction. Refer to the previous
design guidelines on entrances and doors for appropriate examples of entrance
and door types.
   (b)    Windows: Use surrounding buildings as a guide in the shape and size
of windows in new construction. Glazing and window divisions should approximate
traditional patterns. Refer to the previous design guidelines on windows for
appropriate examples of traditional window types.
   Blank, windowless walls along public streets are strongly discouraged. A
large factor in successful downtown commercial districts is the pedestrian
activity at the sidewalk level. Blank walls tend to reduce this activity.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1175.04 SITE PLAN ARRANGEMENTS.
   Some components of the streetscape tend to reinforce an area's
attractiveness and help to make it a desirable area to live or do business. The
regular setback of building facades provides a consistent, unbroken view along
the street. The close placement of buildings without large intervening open
spaces can provide sense of continuity and activity. Well-maintained
landscaping features impart a sense that property owners and businesses care
about the downtown.
   (a)    Setbacks: New construction should observe the typical or traditional
setbacks of surrounding buildings. The setback typical in downtown Zanesville
is at the edge of the sidewalk, or a zero setback. It is strongly encouraged
that new construction occur on empty lots and close to adjacent buildings in
order to fill in some of the blank spots along the streets.
   (b)    Parking: In order to reduce the negative impact of large parking lots
on the streetscape, consider placing parking lots at the rear of the lot and
locating the building along the sidewalk. If possible, access to the parking
lot should be from a side street or an alley to lessen the number of curb cuts
along main streets. Avoid suburban-type development that gives priority to the
parking lot and surrounds the building with parked cars.

Line drawings that correspond to written design guidelines are a useful
reference for architects and property owners planning new construction
projects.
SOME INFALL FAILS TO FILL
Gaps in the "urban wall" invite new developments that emphasize, rather than
close, the gaps.

INFILL SHOULD CLOSE GAPS
Inappropriate infill structures like the one-story drive-in shown above should
be avoided. Instead, the example below illustrates that the gap in the "urban
wall" is more effectively closed by a several-story building that stretches
across the gap. The facade is divided into bays that complement the street
rhythm set by existing structures.

1177.01 PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Owners of both improved and unimproved properties, whether occupied or
vacant, shall be responsible for the maintenance in good repair, safe and
sanitary condition, and presentable appearance so as not to create a blighting
influence on nearby property, of those portions of their property that are
visible from the street or from another public area.
   (b)   Such maintenance shall include the following items installed on the
property of either owners or the tenants:
      (1)   All building facades, including trim, windows and window frames,
and cornices and upper stories as well as streetlevel areas;
      (2)   All walks, stairways, landings, fire escapes, porches and patios;
      (3)   All landscaping, including trees, grass, ground cover and shrubs;
      (4)   Lighting, including the prompt replacement of burned-out bulbs;
      (5)   Signs, awnings, canopies, walls and fences;
      (6)   Off-street parking, loading, driveway and refuse disposal areas;
      (7)   Exterior display or storage of materials, merchandise or equipment
is prohibited, with the exception of a downtown merchant's special event; and
      (8)   Open spaces and vacant areas or lots.
   (c)   Property visible from public areas shall be free of excessive peeling
of paint, crumbling stone or brick, loose shingles or siding, cracked or broken
glass, untrimmed or overgrown vegetation, and debris, litter and rubble.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.02 PUBLIC SIDEWALK AND STREETSCAPE CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE.
   Ground Floor property owners shall be responsible for the cleaning of and
removal of loose paper and refuse from public sidewalks from the property line
to the curb.
   Property owners shall be responsible for repair or replacement of sidewalks
abutting their property.
   The City shall be responsible for:
   (a)   The cleaning and maintenance of City streets and alleys and of the
lighting thereof where such lighting may be installed; and
   (b)   The repair or replacement of City streets, alleys and public
streetscape improvements, including sidewalk landscaping and street lights.
   The cleaning, maintenance and repair of privately-owned property permitted
by the City on sidewalks, such as private planters, private benches or outdoor
restaurant seating, shall be the responsibility of the owner thereof.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.03 NONFUNCTIONAL UTILITY WIRING.
   The owner of a property shall cause to be removed any utility wiring on such
property that is no longer functional within ninety (90) days of its becoming
nonfunctional.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.04 LANDSCAPING MAINTENANCE.
   As provided in Section 907.04 of the Codified Ordinances, property owners or
ground floor occupants shall, as appropriate, remove, trim, prune, weed or
spray any tree, shrub or planting strip upon or in the public right-of-way
abutting their property that:
   (a)   Is diseased, dead, infested or dangerous; or
   (b)   Obstructs the free passage of pedestrians or traffic; or
   (c)   Fails to provide at maturity a clearance of eight (8) feet above a
sidewalk or fifteen (15) feet above a roadway.
   Maintenance of landscaping located on portions of a sidewalk that have been
extended into the street beyond the original curb line shall be the
responsibility of the City.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.05 REFUSE MANAGEMENT.
   (a)    Litter Receptacles. The City shall provide in convenient and
conspicuous locations attractive litter receptacles for use by the public. The
City shall empty such receptacles with such frequency as is required to prevent
full or overflowing containers. Refuse from commercial or residential buildings
shall not be deposited in public litter receptacles.
   (b)   Refuse in Containers Only. All outdoor premises on private property
shall be kept clean by the owner or occupant thereof of any refuse, trash or
garbage except for refuse disposal bundles and containers. Refuse set out for
collection shall be contained in trash cans or in securely tied plastic bags.
Newspapers and rags shall be bundled and securely tied if put out separately
for collection, and cartons shall be flattened and secured.
   (c)    Location of Trash Dumpsters. Except for litter containers intended
for the daily use of the public, trash dumspters may be set out on a sidewalk
only in anticipation of collection, but no more than twelve (12) hours in
advance of a scheduled collection. Trash dumpsters shall be removed immediately
after collection. At all other times, dumpsters shall be placed out of view or
be screened.
   (d)    Screening of Trash Dumpsters. Trash dumpsters shall be located to the
rear of all downtown properties. In order to improve the visual quality of the
downtown, trash dumpsters that are not shielded from public ways by buildings
should be screened by other means. The following are appropriate means of
screening refuse containers:
   - Wood privacy fencing
   - Brick walls
   - Painted masonry walls
   - Landscaping combined with the above listed screening types
   The type of material used should be compatible with the existing building.
Appropriate screening and/or fencing would need to be at least as tall as the
trash dumpster, but no more than six (6) feet in height.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.06 STREETSCAPE BEAUTIFICATION.
   The concept of "streetscape" in downtown areas refers to the various
elements that work together to create a particular environmental character or
sense of place. The streetscape is a collection of elements such as; streets,
buildings, sidewalks, trees, landscaping, parking lots, lighting fixtures, and
street furniture such as benches and trash receptacles. Depending upon how the
elements of a streetscape are assembled and maintained, the resulting
appearance might be pleasant, unpleasant, or somewhere in between.
Traditionally, streetscape elements create an environment that has a human
scale and is pedestrian-friendly.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.07 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   All off-street parking in the Design Improvement Area shall be subject to
the restrictions as provided in Chapter
1149.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.08 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   All landscaping and screening in the Design Improvement Area shall be
subject to the restrictions as provided in Chapter
1151.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)
1177.09 EXTERIOR BUILDING LIGHTING.
   The lighting of the outside of downtown buildings is encouraged. Decorative
lighting should emphasize the architectural features of the building being lit.
Sources of lighting should be as unobtrusive as possible. Lighting sources
should also be directed, shaded, shielded, or otherwise arranged so as not to
produce glare in surrounding properties or public streets.
   Downtown business owners are encouraged to light any storefront windows or
display windows that are along public streets. Attractive displays of
merchandise along with seasonal and holiday arrangements are encouraged to add
interest to the downtown pedestrian. Timed light fixtures could also be used
for lighting the storefront displays at night.
(Ord. 96-115. Passed 8-26-96.)

When buildings are razed for parking, it is important to re-establish the
"urban wall" destroyed by the demolition. Trees, fences, and other landscape
elements can help mitigate the loss, as shown in the drawings below. Street
glare is cut by certain trees, and well-placed landscaping adds beauty to the
street and property.

subdivision, including grading, until he or it has obtained from the Planning
Commission the tentative approval of the preliminary plat of the proposed
subdivision. (Before preparing and submitting the preliminary plat to the
Planning Commission, it is suggested that the subdivider or his engineer
consult with the Secretary of the Planning Commission while the plat is in
sketch form, to ascertain the location of proposed highway, primary or
secondary thoroughfares, parkways, parks, playgrounds and other planned
developments.)
   In the planning and developing a subdivision, the subdivider or his agent
shall comply with the general principles of design and minimum requirements for
the layout of subdivision set forth in Chapter
1195 , and with the rules and regulations concerning required improvements set
forth in Sections

at which action is desired.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.03 CHECKING COMPLIANCE OF PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   (a)   The preliminary plat will be checked by the Secretary as to its
conformity with the Thoroughfare Plan and other applicable sections of the
Master Plan and the principles, standards and requirements hereinafter set
forth, and copies of such preliminary plat will be referred for recommendations
or other action as follows prior to submitting the plat to the Planning
Commission:
      (1)   In the case of plats within the City, to the Director of Public
Service, City Engineer, Fire Chief and the Health Commissioner for checking of
matters within their jurisdiction and approval of the improvements proposed to
be installed; or
      (2)   In the case of plats outside the corporate limits of the City, one
copy to the County Engineer, in addition to those stipulated in subsection (a)
above, for checking of matters within his jurisdiction, for reference to the
County Health Commissioner when appropriate, and for approval, in accordance
with rules and regulations adopted by the County Commissioner, of improvements
proposed to be installed.
   (b)   if deemed necessary by the Secretary, a meeting may be called, to be
attended by one or more of the above named officials and the subdivider or
developer or his representative to consider the recommendations by the
officials concerned before presenting the preliminary plat to the Planning
Commission. This procedure shall be followed to facilitate the processing of
the preliminary plat by the Commission.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.04 TENTATIVE APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   Upon receipt of the recommendations and advice of action concerning matters
covered in Section
1189.03, the Planning Commission will tentatively approve or disapprove the
preliminary plat, or approve it with modifications, noting thereon any changes
that will be required. One copy will be returned to the subdivider with the
date of such tentative approval or disapproval endorsed thereon. Similar copies
also will be transmitted to the Director of Public Service in the case of plats
within the City, and to the County Engineer in the case of plats outside the
corporate limits of the City.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.05 EFFECT OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL; IMPROVEMENT PERMITS OR SURETY BOND.
   Upon tentative approval, which is effective for one year unless extended by
the Planning Commission, and subsequent approval of the construction plans, the
subdivider:
   (a)   May secure from the appropriate authorities the necessary permits to
proceed with the street improvements; or, in lieu of this,
   (b)   May post a surety bond running to the City or County, as the case may
be, sufficient to cover the full cost of such improvements as estimated by the
officials having jurisdiction, to assure the satisfactory performance of such
improvements at a time fixed by the Planning Commission and in accordance with
its regulations.
   The subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission the final or record
plat (one reproducible copy and five black line or blue prints) of the
subdivision for final approval, as set forth in Section
1189.06. The final or record plat of any portion of a larger subdivision, the
preliminary plat of which has been tentatively approved by the Planning
Commission, may be submitted for approval.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.06 FINAL PLAT FILING; TITLE TO DEDICATED LANDS.
   The subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission a reproducible copy
and five black line or blue prints of the final or record plat which shall
conform in every respect with the requirements specified in Chapter
1193  of these Subdivision Regulations. These shall be accompanied by a
certification of title showing the ownership of all lands to be dedicated to
the public and that the title thereof is free and unencumbered.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.07 CHECKING FINAL PLAT COMPLIANCE.
   A copy of the final or record plat thus filed will be transmitted to the
Secretary of the Planning Commission, who will check the final plat. If found
satisfactory, he will return such plat to the Planning Commission, together
with a two-fold certificate showing:
   (a)   That the technical details of the plat itself have been checked and
found satisfactory;
   (b)   That all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed,
except where a surety bond has been furnished in lieu of completing such
improvements.
      (Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1189.08 APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   After a copy of the final plat together with the foregoing two-fold
certificate has been received by the Planning Commission from its Secretary,
and provided that the final plat is found to conform with the preliminary plat
as tentatively approved, the Planning Commission will approve the final plat
and will enter such approval thereon in writing by its Chairman and Secretary.
The approval of the final or record plat by the Planning Commission shall not
be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of the dedication
of any street or other proposed public way or space shown on such plat. The
Planning Commission then will transmit the reproducible copy and four prints of
the final plat along with certificate of title to Council or, in the case of a
subdivision outside the corporate limits of the City, to the County
Commissioners, for such action as may be necessary on any proposed dedication.
Thereupon, Council or the County Commissioners, as the case may be, will return
the reproducible copy and three approved prints thereof to the Planning
Commission for the subdivider, the Director of Public Service (the reproducible
copy) and, where appropriate, the County Engineer.

1195.01 DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   In order to protect the safety, health, and general welfare of the people of
the City and environs, the Planning Commission will not approve the plat of any
proposed subdivision located in an area subject to periodic floods. When a
subdivision is located in an area having poor drainage or other adverse
physical conditions, the Planning Commission may approve the plat of the
proposed subdivision, provided that the subdivider complies with the City’s
stormwater drainage regulations as contained in Chapter 1335 and agrees to
perform such improvements as will, in the judgment of the Public Service
Director, render the subdivision substantially safe and otherwise acceptable
for residential use. The Planning Commission shall not approve any plat of any
proposed subdivision without the review by the Public Service Director of the
general stormwater drainage permit as outlined in Chapter 1335 and compliance
thereof.
(Ord. 98-69. Passed 5-26-98.)
1195.02 COMPLIANCE.
   In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the general
principles and requirements set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.03 THOROUGHFARE PLAN COMPLIANCE; PARKS AND RECREATION AREAS.
   (a)   The subdivision layout shall conform to the Thoroughfare Plan and
other officially adopted parts of the Master Plan of the City and environs.
      (1)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway,
thoroughfare or parkway, so designated on the Thoroughfare Plan, such part of
the public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and at the
width indicated on the Plan.
      (2)   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site or
other public ground shown in the adopted Master Plan is located in whole or in
part within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if
not dedicated to the City, County, Board of Education or Park Board, shall be
reserved for the acquisition by the City, County, Board of Education or Park
Board, within a period of two years by purchase or other means.
   (b)   Where held appropriate by the Planning Commission, open spaces,
constituting a reasonable proportion of the gross acreage of the subdivision,
suitably located, and of adequate size for parks, playgrounds or other
recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use, shall be provided for in
the proposed subdivision and if not dedicated to the City or County, as the
case may be, shall be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the
proposed subdivision by covenant in the deeds.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.04 STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (a)   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood.
      (1)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
      (2)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets of reasonable length (normally
not over 600 feet) will be approved where necessitated by topography or where,
in the judgment of the Planning Commission, they are appropriate for the type
of development contemplated. No strips of land along tract boundaries, tending
to preclude street extensions, will be permitted.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as the topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
      (4)   Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided a
dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half
width of such street or alley shall be platted.
      (5)   Alleys shall be platted in all commercial and industrial areas if
no other provisions are made for adequate access to parking and loading spaces.
To provide safe access to residential lots located on highways, thoroughfares
and parkways, alleys may be platted in the rear of such lots or service drives
provided in front thereof, or such lots shall be platted as suggested in
subsections (a)(6)B. and C. hereof. Alleys will not be approved in other
locations in residence districts, unless required by unusual topography or
other exceptional conditions.
      (6)   Land abutting highways or principal thoroughfares shall be platted
with the view of making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for such
use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways; and with the
view also of minimizing interference with traffic on such trafficways as well
as the accident hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
         A.   By platting the lots abutting such trafficways at very generous
depths, and by providing vehicular access to them by means of either alleys or
service drives in the rear, or frontage access roads next to the highway,
connected therewith at infrequent intervals.
         B.   Another more desirable and usually more economical method
consists of not fronting the lots on the highway but on a minor street
paralleling the highway at a distance of a generous lot depth. Private
driveways in this case would, of course, connect with such minor street.
         C.   Under still another scheme, a collector street may be platted
more or less parallel with the highway, 600 to 1,000 feet distant therefrom,
from which loop streets or dead-end streets would extend toward the highway,
the ends of which would provide access to the lots backing upon the highway.
The choice, in a specific case, among the foregoing or other methods for
accomplishing the purpose in view, must necessarily be made in consideration of
topography and other physical conditions, the character of existing and
contemplated developments and other pertinent factors that apply in each case.
      (7)   Private streets will not be approved nor will public improvements
be approved in any private street.
      (8)   Temporary dead-end streets will be permitted where necessitated by
the design of the subdivision, provided that temporary turn-arounds be
constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end streets. The
needed area for such turn-arounds shall be the same as required for permanent
turn-arounds, provided that the area in excess of the street right of way shall
be vacated upon extension of the temporary street.
   (b)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth.
      (1)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, are appropriate for the locality and the type of
development contemplated, but shall not exceed 1800 feet where the average size
of lots does not exceed two acres in area, and shall not be less than 500 feet.
      (2)   In any block of over 900 feet in length the Planning Commission may
require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than ten feet wide, be
provided near the center and entirely across such block.
      (3)   The number of intersecting streets along highways, thoroughfares
and parkways shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, blocks along
such trafficways shall be not less than 1200 feet in length.
         (Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.05 MINIMUM RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTHS.
   Minimum right-of-way widths of streets, alleys and easements for utilities
shall be as follows (extra easements for back slopes may be required by the
Planning Commission where necessary):
   (a)   Highways, primary thoroughfares and parkways as specified on the
Thoroughfare Plan but not less than eighty feet wide in any case.
   (b)   Secondary thoroughfares as specified on the Thoroughfare Plan, but not
less than sixty feet wide in any case.
   (c)   Local streets or collector streets: sixty feet.
   (d)   Minor streets and dead-end streets: fifty feet. All dead-end streets
shall terminate in a circular turn-around having a minimum right-of-way
diameter of eighty feet, unless the Planning Commission approved at "T" or "Y"-
shaped paved space in place of the required turning circle.
   (e)   Where easements are required for utilities their width shall be at
least ten feet centered on rear and side lot lines.
   (f)   Alleys: twenty feet.
      (Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.06 MINIMUM PAVEMENT WIDTHS.
   Minimum pavement widths, face to face of curb, required to be installed at
the subdivider's expense, shall be as follows:
   (a)   Primary and secondary thoroughfares and parkways, shown as such on the
Thoroughfare Plan, local streets or collector streets, and minor streets over
600 feet long: twenty-six feet.
      In the case of primary or secondary thoroughfares or parkways and in the
case of local streets or collector streets usually requiring pavements wider
than twenty-six feet, the matter of financial and other arrangements for
installing such wider pavements at the time the subdivider makes the
improvement shall be taken up by the subdivider with the officials having
jurisdiction.
   (b)   Minor and dead-end streets not over 600 feet long, or streets in
estate type subdivisions: twenty-two feet (face to face of curb where curb is
required or otherwise installed). The pavement of a turning circle at the end
of a dead-end street shall have a minimum outside diameter of sixty feet. A "T"
or "Y"-shaped paved space, when approved by the Planning Commission in place of
a turning circle, shall extend entirely across the width of the street right of
way and shall be at least ten feet wide with the flared portion rounded by
minimum radii of twenty feet.
   (c)   Alleys and service drives: eighteen feet.
      (Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.07 STREET GRADES, CURVES AND SIGHT DISTANCES.
   (a)   The grades of streets shall be not less than one-half of one percent
(0.5%) and shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   Highways and primary thoroughfares, shown as such on the
Thoroughfare Plan: five percent (5%).
      (2)   Secondary thoroughfares, parkways, local or collector streets:
seven percent (7%)
      (3)   Minor streets, service drives and alleys: ten percent (10%).
      (4)   Pedestrian ways or crosswalks: twelve percent (12%) unless steps of
an acceptable design are constructed.
   (b)   All changes in street grades above one percent (1%) shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equal to fifteen times the algebraic
difference in the change of grade for highways, thoroughfares and parkways, and
one-half of this minimum for all other streets.
   (c)   The radii of curvature on the center line shall not be less than the
following: highways, thoroughfares and parkways, shown as such on the
Thoroughfare Plan, 600 feet.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.08 INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   At street and alley intersections property line corners shall be
rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be ten and five feet,
respectively. In business districts a chord may be substituted for such arc.
   (b)   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty
feet.
   (c)   The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle of
intersection is less than sixty degrees.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1195.09 LOTS.
   (a)   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated.
   (b)   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A proportion of
two to one shall normally be considered as appropriate.
   (c)   Every lot shall abut on a publicly dedicated street.
   (d)   Lots for residence purposes shall be at least sixty feet wide at the
building setback line, in order to permit compliance with the side yard
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and still be adequate for a building of
practicable width.
   (e)   Double-frontage lots and reversed-frontage lots shall be avoided.
   (f)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-
way line of the street on which the lot abuts.
   (g)   Corner lots for residential use shall be platted wider than interior
lots in order to permit conformance with the setback on the side street
required by the Zoning Ordinance. Special consideration should be given to the
size of the corner lots where a residence may be proposed to face a side
street.
   (h)   Residential lots fronting or abutting on highways, thoroughfares and
other important trafficways should have extra depth to permit deep setbacks for
the buildings from such trafficways.

   (b)   Plans for the construction and installation of improvements shall be
submitted as set out in Section
1191.05, of these Subdivision Regulations and shall be constructed under the
supervision of the governmental departments and agencies normally responsible
for the type of work involved, and shall be constructed in accordance with the
regulations of these departments and agencies.
   In lieu of constructing such improvements the subdivider shall furnish a
performance bond running to the City sufficient to cover the subdivider's
proportion of the cost, as estimated by the normally responsible departments
and agencies and approved by the Planning Commission of any or all of the
improvements required to be installed thereby to secure the actual construction
and installation of such improvements immediately after final approval of the
final plat or at a time and according to the requirements of the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   Streets and alleys shall be graded to full width of the dedicated
right of way, and side slopes, if any, shall start at the right-of-way line and
slope upward or downward as topography necessitates. Before any sewers or
underground utilities are constructed the street wearing surface area shall be
graded to sub-base elevation according to the construction plans.
   All streets shall have standard concrete combined curb and gutter and shall
have either:
      (1)   A wearing surface of T-35 asphaltic concrete two and one-half
inches thick on a compacted stone base course eight inches thick; or
      (2)   Concrete pavement constructed in accordance with specifications of
the Division of Engineering and Construction.
   No surface treated or gravel streets or alley will be permitted.
   Where alleys or similar accessways are approved by the Planning Commission,
they shall be properly graded the full width of the right of way and paved with
concrete. In estate type subdivisions, where dedicated rights of way for
streets are sixty feet or more in width and where the lots have a street
frontage of 150 feet or more, combined concrete curb and gutter may not be
required if the street right of way is graded in accordance with the standard
typical section of the Division of Engineering and Construction and the side
ditches and road shoulders are properly seeded in grass. Wearing surfaces of
streets in this type of subdivision shall not be less than twenty-two feet wide
with intersections provided with ample turning radii.
   (d)   Sidewalks of such width and type of construction as required by the
Planning Commission shall be constructed on both sides of every street where
lots are a width of sixty feet or less. Sidewalks shall be constructed on one
or both sides of the streets irrespective of the width of lots, where in the
judgment of the Planning Commission, these are necessary to protect the safety
of pedestrians. Where plats are designed with interior walkways, walks shall be
fully constructed to adequately serve the area being platted.
   (e)   Where a public water supply main is reasonably accessible, in the
judgment of the Planning Commission, the subdivision shall be provided with a
complete water distribution system adequate to serve the area being platted,
including a connection for each lot and appropriately spaced fire hydrants.
Where public water supply is not available within reasonable distance, the
average size of lots shall not be less than 20,000 square feet and the
subdivider or developer shall provide for individual wells. The entire water
supply and/or distribution system shall be designed to meet the approval of the
officials having jurisdiction.
   (f)   Every subdivision shall be provided with storm sewers of adequate size
to serve the subdivision and the natural drainage area in which the subdivision
is situated. Where the subdivider is permitted to use open ditches or natural
drainage ditches and creeks, they shall be properly graded and enlarged to
sufficient cross section to adequately care for the storm water run-off without
the velocity of water being sufficient to cause erosion of the stream bed. The
open ditches or natural drains shall have the side slopes sodded or seeded in
grass and curves properly riprapped to prevent erosion.
   If deemed necessary, natural watercourses and open drainage channels shall
be placed in easements, running to the City or be located in areas dedicated to
the City, in order that the control of the watercourse or open drainage
channels shall be in the City's jurisdiction and so that representatives of the
City may enter upon the easement or dedicated area to maintain the open
drainage channel.
   Catch basins shall be provided as required to properly intercept storm water
run-off and prevent flooding of streets or alleys.
   Location of storm sewers, catch basins and construction of open drainage
channels shall conform to the regulations of the Division of Engineering and
Construction.
   (g)   Where a public sanitary sewer main is reasonably accessible, in the
judgment of the Planning Commission, the subdivision shall be provided with a
complete sanitary sewer system connected with such sewer main, including a
lateral connection for each lot. Where a public sanitary sewer main is not
reasonably accessible, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, proper
provision shall be made for the disposal of sanitary wastes by one or the other
of the following methods, as the case may be:
      (1)   In the case of a subdivision in which the average size of lots is
less than 20,000 square feet, the subdivision shall be provided with a complete
sewer system, including a lateral connection for each lot, and a community
sewage treatment plant of a type meeting the approval of the officials having
jurisdiction. In such case, or whenever a common effluent sewer line is
provided the following note shall be entered on the final plat: "The tile that
is laid for the purpose of serving as an effluent line for an individual or
community septic tank is a private sewer line and the responsibility of
maintenance shall rest with the abutting property owners using such line," or,
alternately, the right of the City to charge the actual cost of operating and
maintaining such common effluent sewer line and/or treatment plant shall be
entered on the final record plat and incorporated in each deed.
      (2)   In the case of a subdivision in which the average size of lots is
20,000 square feet or more in area, and a public water supply is available, and
where the officials having jurisdiction deem appropriate based on soil and
other conditions as determined by a percolation and other tests, private
restrictions shall be filed with the final or record plat and incorporated in
each deed calling for the installation on each lot of an individual sewage
disposal system meeting fully the requirements of the officials having
jurisdiction.
   (h)   Where practicable, easements for poles or underground conduits for
electric light or telephone lines shall be provided along rear lot lines.
   (i)   Guard rails shall be constructed and berm width increased one foot
when the vertical distance from the center line of the street to the top of the
slopefill is five feet or more.
   (j)   The City will place all street signs in accepted subdivisions.
   (k)   Permanent monuments shall be placed in accordance with the
requirements of the City Engineer. The permanent reference monuments shall be
of stone or concrete or other suitable material as approved by the Planning
Commission and shall be at least thirty-six inches in length, a minimum of two
inches diameter, and with suitable center point.
   (l)   Construction plans, including the following, for improvements to be
installed shall be furnished in accordance with the specifications of the
officials having jurisdiction and shall receive approval of these officials
before improvements are installed:
      (1)   The center line profile (and natural profile) of each proposed
street at a scale of fifty feet or less to the inch, with tentative grades
indicated.
      (2)   Cross section of each proposed street, at not less than each fifty-
foot station, showing the width of pavement, the location and width of the
sidewalks and the location and size of utility mains.
      (3)   The plans and profiles of proposed sanitary sewers, with grades and
sizes indicated, or method of sewage disposal in lieu of sewers.
      (4)   A drainage plan showing all existing and proposed storm sewers,
manholes, catch basins, watercourses, culverts and other underground structures
within the tract and immediately adjacent thereto, with pipe sizes and grades
or waterway openings indicated thereon. The drainage plan shall show the method
to be used for the adequate disposal of all storm sewer water, including
drainage outlets, and such other data as may be required by the Director of
Public Service.
      (5)   A plan of the proposed water distribution system, showing pipe
sizes and the location of valves and fire hydrants.
   (m)   Prior to starting any of the work covered by the plans as approved,
arrangements, including payment of fees for inspection and/or engineering
services of the responsible government departments and agencies, to insure
compliance with the plans and specifications as approved, and written approval
obtained from such departments and agencies.
   (n)   The construction of all improvements required by these rules and
regulations shall be completed prior to filing the final plat, or, when a
performance bond has been filed, within one year from the date of approval of
the final plat by the Planning Commission, unless good cause can be shown for
the granting of an extension of time by authority of the Planning Commission.
   (o)   The subdivider shall maintain and keep in repair all required
improvements for one year from the date the constructed streets are approved by
the Director of Public Service.
   (p)   The approval of a plat by the Planning Commission shall not be deemed
to be an acceptance of the dedication of any public street, road or highway
dedicated in such plat. The Director of Public Service shall, upon written
request by the owner of the land upon which the street has been constructed,
check the construction and if he finds that such street is in good repair, then
such finding shall be certified to Council for their consideration and action
in accepting such street for public use.
   (q)   Where unusual or exceptional factors or conditions exist, the Planning
Commission may modify any of the provisions of these regulations except those
covered by subsection (b) of this section. A written statement of the reasons
for such modification shall be attached to all copies of the construction
plans.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1197.03 "B" AREA IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   This section contains rules and regulations establishing minimum

1199.01 PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY.
   The general principles of design and the minimum requirements for the laying
out of subdivisions, stipulated in Chapter
1195, may be varied by the Planning Commission in the case of a subdivision
large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood to be
developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan, safeguarded by appropriate
restrictions which in the judgment of the Planning Commission make adequate
provision for all essential community requirements. However, no modification
shall be granted by the Planning Commission which would conflict with the
proposals of the Thoroughfare Plan, or with other features of the adopted
Master Plan of the City and environs, or with the intent and purpose of such
general principles of design and minimum requirements.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1199.02 PRELIMINARY PLAT EXEMPTION FOR MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   In the case of a small subdivision of minor importance situated in a
locality where conditions are well defined, the Planning Commission may exempt
the subdivider from complying with some or all of the requirements stipulated
in Chapter
1191 pertaining to the preparation of the preliminary plat.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1199.03 APPROVAL WITHOUT PLAT.
   A proposed division of a parcel of land along the existing public street,
not involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, nor a
private easement of access, and involving no more than five lots after the
original tract has been completely subdivided, may be submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval without plat. The request shall be accompanied by a
sketch, prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor, and such other
information as is pertinent. Such sketch shall show the original tract being
divided, the tract to be conveyed and adjacent owners and such sketch shall be
recorded as a part of the deed conveyance. If the Planning Commission is
satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to applicable platting,
subdividing or zoning regulations, it shall, within seven working days after
submission, approve such proposed division and, on presentation of a conveyance
of such parcel, shall stamp the same "Approved by City Planning Commission,
Zanesville, Ohio; no plat required" and have it signed and dated by its Clerk,
Secretary or other official as may be designated by it. The Planning Commission
may waive the requirement for submission of a sketch for the division of a lot
of a recorded subdivision plat.
(Ord. 64-47. Passed 4-27-64.)
1199.04 UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   In any particular case where the subdivider or his engineer can show by plan
and written statement that, by reason of exceptional topographic or other
physical conditions, strict compliance with any requirement of these
Subdivision Regulations would cause practical difficulty or exceptional and
undue hardship, the Planning Commission may relax such requirement to the
extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship.
However, such relief may be granted without detriment to the public good and
without impairing the intent and purpose of these Subdivision Regulations or
the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the community in
accordance with the Master Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. Any modification thus
granted shall be entered in the minutes of the Planning Commission setting
forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Commission, justified the
modification.

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval. (OBC

1347.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSES; OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Zanesville, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Zanesville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
         generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Zanesville as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Zanesville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Muskingum County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Muskingum County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
both effective July 6, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Zanesville as required by Section
1347.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 401 Market Street Zanesville, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Zanesville, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 10-20.
Passed 4-12-10.)
 
1347.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Zanesville's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Zanesville
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 16, 1988, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's
Department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)    Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 10-20. Passed 4-12-10.)

1347.03(j)(1), a Letter of Map Revision.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1347.05 of these regulations.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for:
      (1)   Maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing,
or for small nonstructural development activities (except for filling and
grading) valued at less than $5,000.
      (2)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured home
park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Health and subject

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Zanesville flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1347.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1347.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1347.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1347.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Zanesville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Zanesville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Zanesville Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Zanesville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Zanesville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Zanesville has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1347.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1347.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Zanesville and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1347.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Zanesville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1347.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 10-20. Passed 4-12-10.)
1347.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Zanesville Planning Commission is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 401 Market Street Zanesville, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1347.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) due at submission.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1347.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

property, including the kind, color and texture of exterior building materials
and the type, character and design of doors, windows, signs, light fixtures,
moldings, railings and other appurtenance, or
            2.    The landscaping, fencing, parking facilities, accessory uses
or street furniture on or abutting such property, whether or not such action
requires any other certificate or permit hereunder.
         D.    No certificate shall be required for:
            1.    Routine maintenance and repair that does not involve
structural change or significant change, in the judgment of the Zoning
Administrator, to material, design, texture, color or other aspects of the
outer appearance of a property, or
            2.    Any construction, alteration or demolition which in the
judgment of the Zoning Administrator is required for public safety because of
imminent peril to life, health or property.
      (3)    Approval process. An application for a certificate shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator, who shall refer the application to the Historic
Preservation Board. The Board shall review and within sixty days of its receipt
either approve, conditionally approve or deny the application based on the
applicable approval criteria in subsection (c) hereof. If no finding by the
Zoning Administrator or the Historic Preservation Board is made within the
specified period, the application shall automatically be denied. The Board may
call upon technical personnel within or outside the City government to assist
in the review of the application.
      (4)   Existing certificates. Any lawful certificate of appropriateness
previously granted to any lawful use existing on the adoption of this Code, or
any applicable amendment thereto that requires a certificate, shall be
considered a lawful certificate thereunder without need for approval of a new
certificate.
      (5)    Expansion or alteration. Any change of, expansion of, addition to,
or alteration of a use holding a certificate of appropriateness shall require
the approval of an additional certificate by the Zoning Administrator.
      (6)    Appeal. An applicant or other party may appeal the Board's
decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the provisions on
appeals in Section
1353.07 .
   No appeal of an application that has been denied shall be taken until a
period of thirty days, or forty-five days for any application involving
demolition, has elapsed beginning with the date of the denial by the Historic
Preservation Board. During such period, the Historic Preservation Board shall
attempt to work out an alternative plan with the applicant that is acceptable
to both the applicant and the Board.
   
   (c)    Approval Criteria for Certificates of Appropriateness.
      (1)   In granting approval or conditional approval of a certificate of
appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Board shall prepare written findings
of fact that the proposed alteration or change is compatible, as applicable,
with the character of:
         A.    The existing property being altered, and
         B.    Surrounding properties, and
         C.    Adjacent public ways, and
         D.    The historic district, if any, in which the property is located.
      (2)    Such compatibility shall be judged with respect to the following
elements of design:
         A.    Height and scale.
         B.    Proportions of windows, doors, sign lettering and other design
features.
         C.    Shape of roof.

of the structure.

compatibility as can be achieved without depriving the property owner of
reasonable use of and a reasonable economic return from his property.

registered building and all process in any court proceeding or administrative
enforcement proceeding brought to enforce code provisions concerning the
registered building by service of the notice or process on the authorized
agent. Any owner who has designated an authorized agent under the provisions of
this subsection shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's
designation for the purposes of this subsection until the owner notifies the
Division of Building and Code Enforcement of a change of authorized agent or
until the owner files a new annual registration statement.
   (c)    Any owner who fails to register a vacant building under the
provisions of this subsection shall further be deemed to consent to receive, by
posting at the building, any and all notices of code violations and all process
in an administrative proceeding brought to enforce code provisions concerning
the building and premises.
   (d)    The Building Official may issue rules and regulations for the
administration of this section. These rules may designate board-up materials
and methods which must be used when securing a building so that the boarding is
reasonably incapable of being removed by trespassers or others acting without
the building owner's consent. Any person who violates any provision of this
section or of the rules and regulations issued hereunder and fails to maintain
the property according to the currently adopted Property Maintenance Code shall
