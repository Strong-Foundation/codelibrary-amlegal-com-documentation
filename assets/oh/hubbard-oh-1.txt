EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances. (ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

CHAPTER 109
Public Records Policy
109.01    Introduction.
109.02    Public records.
109.03    Record requests.
109.04    Costs for public records.
109.05    Failure to respond to a public records request.
109.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   It is the policy of the City of Hubbard, Ohio in Trumbull County that
openness leads to a better informed citizenry, which leads to more transparent
government and sounder public policy. It is our policy to strictly adhere to
the state's Public Records Act as well as other state and federal laws.
   (b)   Ohio's Public Records Act imposes two primary obligations upon public
offices:
      (1)   Provide prompt inspection of public records; and
      (2)   Provide copies of public records within a reasonable period of
time.
   (c)   The Public Records Act evolved from the principle that Ohio's citizens
are entitled to access the records of their government. We agree that to
advance that principle, the Public Records Act should be interpreted liberally
in favor of disclosure.
(Ord. 27-07. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   (1)   Under Ohio law, a public office may only create records that are
necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the
agency and for the protection of the legal and financial rights of the state
and persons directly affected by the agency's activities.
      (2)   In accordance with the Ohio Revised Code and court rulings,
"records" are defined as those items that meet all of the following:
         A.   Any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or
characteristic, including an electronic record (which includes but is not
limited to e-mail or other record created, generated, sent, communicated,
received, or stored by electronic means);
         B.   That is created or received by, or coming under the jurisdiction
of a public office; and
         C.   That documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.
      (3)   The determination of whether a specific item constitutes a "record"
will depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular item
requested. The Ohio Supreme Court has imposed an actual use standard in
defining a "record," which means that an item is not automatically a "record"
simply because the public office could (but did not) use a document it received
to carry out its duties and responsibilities.
      (4)   Furthermore, a public office is not required to create new records
to respond to a public records request, even if it is only a matter of
compiling information from existing records.
   (b)   (1)   It is the policy of the City of Hubbard, Ohio in Trumbull County
that, as required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that
they are made available for inspection to any person at all reasonable times
during regular business hours.
      (2)   Copies will be made available upon request within a reasonable
period of time.
      (3)   A current record retention schedule will be readily available to
the public upon request.
   (c)   (1)   Not all of the City of Hubbard's records are "public records."
Certain records are exempt from the Public Records Act. Exempt records include
records, the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law, or that
are subject to an express exception set forth in Ohio's Public Records Act,
which may be released only if the City of Hubbard decides to waive the express
exception.
      (2)   Examples of records, the release of which is prohibited by state or
federal law, include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Attorney-client privileged information;
         B.   Records of a Certified Public Accountant or public accountant in
the performance of an audit of a public office;
         C.   Federal tax returns;
         D.   Criminal background information and other law enforcement
information on the LEADS/CCH/NCIC computer database;
         E.   Records that have been sealed pursuant to a statutorily
authorized court order;
         F.   Peace officer's home address during the pendency of a criminal
case in which the officer is a witness or arresting officer; and
         G.   Employees' and their family members records that were created for
purposes of the Family Medical Leave Act or the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
      (3)   Examples of records that are subject to an express exception set
forth in Ohio's Public Records Act, which may be released only if the City of
Hubbard decides to waive the express exception include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         A.   Peace Officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor, assistant
prosecutor, children's services worker, or corrections officer, Residential and
Familial Information;
         B.   Records that pertain to a patient's medical history, diagnosis,
prognosis, or medical condition and that were general and maintained in the
process of medical treatment;
         C.   Records that contain information that was specifically compiled
in reasonable anticipation of, or in defense of, a civil or criminal action or
proceeding;
         D.   Records that pertain to a law enforcement matter of a criminal,
quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature and that, if released, would
create a high probability of disclosing any of the following: the identity of
an uncharged suspect, the identity of a confidential source, specific
confidential investigatory techniques or procedures; specific investigative
work product; or information that would endanger the life or physical safety of
law enforcement personnel, a crime victim, a witness, or a confidential source.
      (4)   The exemptions to the Public Records Act will be narrowly construed
by this office in the favor of disclosure. This office may seek a legal review
prior to determining whether or not an exception applies.
         (Ord. 27-07. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.03 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow this office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If a
requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in
making a request for copies or inspection of public records such that this
office cannot reasonably identify what public records are being requested, then
this office may deny the request. In such case, this office will provide the
requester with an opportunity to revise the request by informing him/her of the
manner in which records are maintained by the office and accessed in the
ordinary course of this office’s duties.
   (b)   (1)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his/her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. However, the records custodian may ask for a written
request and may ask for the requestor's identity and/or intended use of the
information requested if it would benefit the requestor by helping the public
office identify, locate or deliver the records being sought, and the requestor
is informed that a written request and the requestor's identity and intended
use of the information requested are not required.
      (2)   This office will permit a requester to choose to have the public
record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium which this office keeps it,
or upon any other medium which this office determines that it reasonably can be
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of this office. This
office is not required to allow the requester to make the copies of the public
record.
   (c)   (1)   Public records should be available for inspection at all
reasonable times during regular business hours. Public records should be made
available for inspection promptly. To the extent that an office may operate 24-
hours-a- day, the records of that office will be made available for inspection
during normal administrative hours.
      (2)   Copies of public records should be made available within a
reasonable period of time.
      (3)   The determination of the terms "prompt" and "reasonable" take into
account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the location where
the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the records
requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), resolutions,
budgets, etc.
   (e)   (1)   Upon request, this office will provide copies of public records
to a requester by United States mail or by any other delivery means or
transmission that this office deems reasonable.
      (2)   This office will limit to ten the number of copies of public
records provided per month to a requester by United States Mail, unless the
requester certifies in writing that he/she does not intend to use or forward
the requested records, or the information contained in them, for commercial
purposes. (The word "commercial" should be narrowly construed and does not
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information to
assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or activities of
government, or nonprofit educational research).
   (f)   By Ohio law, this office is not required to permit a person who is
incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to
inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal
investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal
investigation if the subject of the investigation or prosecution were an adult,
unless the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect
to the person, or the judge's successor in office, finds that the information
sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a
justifiable claim of the person.
   (g)   This office, in response to a written request made and signed by a
journalist, which must include the journalist’s name and title and the name and
address of the journalist’s employer and which states that the disclosure of
the information sought would be in the public interest, will provide the
address of the actual personal residence of anyone employed by this office as a
peace officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor, assistant prosecutor, children’s
services worker, or corrections officer, and, if such employee’s spouse, former
spouse, or child is employed by a public office, the name and address of that
public office.
   (h)   (1)   Any denial of public records requested, in part or in whole,
should include an explanation, including legal authority, as to why the request
was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the explanation for
denial will be provided to the requester in writing.
      (2)   If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the
exempt portions should be redacted and the rest released. If there are
redactions, the office will notify the requester of any redaction or make the
redaction plainly visible. Each redaction should be accompanied by a supporting
explanation, including legal authority, as to why the redaction was made.
   (i)   This office has no duty to provide records acquired after a request
for records is complete. (Ord. 27-07. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   (1)   Those seeking public records should be charged only the actual
cost of making copies, unless the cost is otherwise set by statute. Employee
time should not be calculated into the charge for copying a public record.
However, in the event that circumstances make it reasonable for this office to
hire an outside contractor to make copies of the requested records, the
requester will be charged the actual cost paid to the outside contractor for
the copying service. These circumstances may include but not be limited to a
lack of in-house photocopying resources or labor.
      (2)   This office has no duty to provide copies of public records free of
charge to someone who indicates an inability or unwillingness to pay for them.
   (b)   The charge for paper copies is ten cents ($.10) per page.
   (c)   This office may require a requester to pay in advance the cost
involved in providing the copy of the public record, as requested.
   (d)   Upon request, this office will provide copies of public records to a
requester by United States mail or by any other delivery means or transmission
that this office deems reasonable. This office may require such a requester to
pay in advance the cost of postage or costs incurred for other supplies used in
the mailing, delivery, or transmission.
   (e)   There may be instances when this office may be able to provide copies
made in-house without disrupting its normal functions, but only over an
extended period of time. In that instance, this office may offer the requester
the options of having the documents produced through a faster method by
employing temporary personnel and equipment, using an external private
contractor, or having the documents produced in-house by this public office's
normal staff and equipment in a less efficient and more time-consuming manner.
(Ord. 27-07. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.05  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   This office recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, this office’s failure to comply
with a request may result in the requester commencing a mandamus action against
this office in either the court of common pleas, in the court of appeals, or in
the Supreme Court of Ohio. The court may order this office to comply with the
Public Records Act, as well as order this office to pay statutory damages of
one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each business day (beginning with the day the
requester files the mandamus action) during which this public office failed to
comply (up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000)) as well as court
costs and the requester’s reasonable attorney fees.

   (1)   Meetings. All meetings of the Council shall be held in the Council
Chambers, unless otherwise provided for by a majority (4) vote of all members
elected to City Council. Any change of meetings shall be in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 121.22. All meetings, except those excluded by Ohio R.C. 121.22,

which has by resolution been adjourned; and unless otherwise especially
ordered, all regular meetings shall convene at the hour of 7:00 p.m. local
time. If the regular meeting falls on a legal holiday then the regular meeting
shall be held on the next day following. Additionally, when the regular meeting
falls the day before a Municipal primary, no meeting will be held; thereby,
having only one meeting to be held the third Monday during the month of May.
   (3)   Committee of the Whole. In addition to meetings scheduled pursuant to
subsection (18) hereof, there is hereby scheduled on the first and third Monday
evenings of each month a meeting of the Committee of the Whole, except that no
committee meeting shall be held which has by resolution been adjourned, and
unless otherwise especially ordered, all committee meetings shall convene at
the hour of 6:30 p.m. local time. If the committee meeting falls on a legal
holiday then the committee meeting shall be held on the next day following.
Additional, when the committee meeting falls the day before a municipal
primary, no meeting will be held, thereby, having only one meeting to be held
the third Monday during the month of May. The purpose of this paragraph is to
schedule a meeting of a Committee of the Whole at 6:30 p.m. at the same place
and on the same day of each regular meeting of City Council.
   (4)   Special Meetings. Special meetings may be called at any time by the
Mayor, the President of Council or any three Council members upon at least
twenty-four hours notice to each member of Council, via telephone and/or e-
mail, however, that no such notice shall need be served on any Councilman
present at a meeting of Council at which the President of Council may give oral
notice of the time and purpose of a special meeting. The Clerk of Council is
hereby instructed to furnish telephone reminders to members of Council in
addition to any other required notification. The above twenty-four hour
notification is a courtesy only. It is the responsibility of City Council
Members and other City Officials to furnish the Clerk of Council with telephone
numbers or e-mail addresses to be used for notification purposes.
   (5)   Executive Meetings. The Mayor, or the President of Council may call an
executive meeting at any time he deems necessary as in compliance with Ohio R.
C. 121.22.
   (6)   Quorum. A majority (4) of all the members elected to the Council shall
be a quorum to do business, but a less number may adjourn from day to day and
compel the attendance of absent members in the manner and under such penalties
as shall be prescribed by ordinance or law.
   (7)   Cancellation. At the request of the President of Council and with the
majority (4) of all the members elected to City Council concurring to such
request, the Clerk of Council shall be instructed to notify all members of
Council, appropriate officials, and news media that the duly called meeting has
been canceled.
   (8)   Absence. Any Councilman who cannot attend a special or regular meeting
shall notify the President of Council, Mayor, Clerk of Council or Police

Council member if known. However, a majority of the members present (4) at
Council may excuse any such member from attendance of any regular meeting upon
submitting a valid reason. When so excused, no reduction in salary as herein
provided shall be made for such member's failure to attend. The Mayor, Law
Director, Treasurer, Auditor, and Directors of all departments shall be
required to attend the regular meetings of Council and shall be provided with
seats on the floor of Council. The attendance of the Chief of Police and Fire
Chief as well as heads of various other departments shall only be required in
the event of the absence of the respective Directors (Service and Safety). They
shall be required at any such meeting to answer questions relating to the
affairs of the City under their respective supervision and control as may be
put to them by any member of Council. The Directors and other officials shall
be entitled to take part in the discussion on all questions relating only to
their respective departments.
   (9)   Voting. Every member present shall vote on all questions upon the call
of yeses and noes unless such member(s) has a financial or other interest
related in any manner whatsoever to the subject matter involved or unless such
member(s) is excused from such vote by the unanimous consent of the rest of the
members of Council. Any member of Council present who refuses to vote in the
manner set forth herein shall be guilty of contempt of Council and may be
censured by a majority vote of the rest of the members of Council.

Call; otherwise, he shall not be recorded as present except upon special order
of the Council.
   (11)   Clerk of Council. Council shall choose a Clerk and such other
officers and employees as may be deemed necessary and fix their compensation.
The Clerk shall keep a proper file of all papers and documents which are a part
of the transactions of Council, and all orders of Council, and shall make such
records available to the public, verbatim. In the event of the absence of the
Clerk of Council, the President of Council is hereby charged with the duty of
finding a temporary replacement for such Clerk at the rate of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) per meeting only; or at the rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) for
meeting including preparation of the final copy of the minutes of the meeting.
   (12)   Presiding Officer. The President of Council, and in his absence, the
President Pro Tempore, shall preside over the meeting of Council. In the
absence of the President of Council, the President Pro Tempore shall call
Council to order; and, if after the roll is called and a quorum (4) is present,
the President Pro Tempore shall preside until the President appeals, and shall
discharge all the duties and be clothed with all the powers of the President as
such presiding officer during his absence. The provisions of the Ohio Revised
Code shall govern this subsection, it being the intention of Council that this
subsection, not be governed by Robert’s Rules Revised.
      A.   In the absence of both the President of Council and the President
Pro Tempore, Council may appoint another of its members to act temporarily as a
Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall call all meetings of Council to
order at the hour appointed and shall proceed with the order of business. If a
quorum is present, he shall give the members an opportunity to correct the
journal of the previous meeting following a reading thereof by the Clerk. In
the absence of any objections or corrections, the minutes shall stand approved.
A reading of the minutes of the previous meeting may be dispensed with when the
Clerk has furnished each member of Council with a written copy of the minutes
of the prior meeting at least twenty-four hours before the meeting at which
they are to be read.
      B.   The President, or anyone acting in his stead, shall preserve order
and decorum, prevent clashes of personalities or the impugning of members or
motives, confine members in debate to the question under discussion and shall
decide all points of order subject to an appeal to the Council. While Council
in in session, the members, must preserve order and decorum and a member will
neither, by conversation nor otherwise, delay or interrupt the proceedings or
the peace of Council or disturb any member while speaking or refuse to obey the
orders of the Council or its presiding officer, except as otherwise permitted
herein.
         Any individual making personal, impertinent, or slanderous remarks, or
who shall become boisterous while addressing Council shall be forthwith, by the
presiding officer, barred from further audience before the Council, unless
permission to continue be granted by a majority vote of the Council.
   (13)   Enforcement of Decorum. The Chief of Police, or such member or
members of the Hubbard Police Department as the Chief of Police shall
designate, shall be the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Council meetings. He, or they,
will carry out all orders and instructions given by the Presiding Officer for
the purpose of maintaining order and decorum at the Council meeting.
   (14)   Right of Appeal. Any member may appeal to Council from the ruling of
the Presiding Officer, and if the appeal is seconded, the member making the
appeal may briefly state his reason for the same, and the Presiding Officer may
briefly state his ruling but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no
other member shall participate in the discussion. The Presiding Officer shall
then put the question, "Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?" If a
majority of the members present vote yes, then the ruling of the Chair is
sustained; otherwise, it is overruled.
   (15)   Order of Business. The business of all regular meetings of the

once on any motion and such motion shall require a majority vote (4) of all
members elected to Council in order to prevail.

such suspension shall be taken by the yeses and noes and entered on the
records.
   (33)   Amending Rules. These rules may be amended or new rules adopted by a

policy establishing that he/she has read and understands the policy and will
adhere to the covenants of said policy as provided.

   (a)   Mileage Reimbursement. The use of a privately owned vehicle may be
authorized by the department head provided that there is no detriment to the
City by such use or a City-owned vehicle is not available. Mileage
reimbursement for use of a private automobile/truck used to conduct official
City business will be made based upon the currently enacted Internal Revenue
Service (Federal government) mileage allowance reimbursement rate. To be
eligible for mileage reimbursement, travel must, at a minimum, satisfy the
following requirements:
      (1)   To qualify for mileage reimbursement, travel by private vehicle
must be outside of City of Hubbard corporation limits and Hubbard Township. No
reimbursement shall be made for travel within the City of Hubbard and/or
Hubbard Township. For any travel extending beyond the City/Township limits,
mileage reimbursement shall be calculated with the street address of the
Municipal Building (220 West Liberty Street, Hubbard, Ohio) as the point of
origin.
      (2)   All requests for mileage reimbursement must be supported by one of
the two following forms of evidence: 1) Round trip mileage from the point of
origin as denoted in Item 1 above to the final destination printed and
submitted from an approved GIS system (i.e. Yahoo Maps, Mapquest.com, or other
similar online GIS mapping system); or 2) Appropriately logged on the
prescribed form including beginning and ending vehicle odometer readings,
destination name and address, purpose of travel, time and date leaving and
returning, and names of other persons traveling in same vehicle. The
designation “local” will not suffice as a description of any travel.
         A.   When using the GIS reporting option, mileage reimbursement will
only be paid from point of origin to destination. For example if a Mapquest.com
map denotes mileage from 220 West Liberty Street to Columbus, Ohio as 175
miles, reimbursement will be paid for 350 miles of travel. Map and driving
directions must be submitted with reimbursement request in order to receive
payment.
      (3)   Reimbursement shall be payable to only one of two or more employees
traveling in the same automobile.

five dollars ($35.00) per day. The thirty-five dollars ($35.00) may be

reimbursement. Meals provided at no cost will not be reimbursed.
      (2)   On a single day of travel, an employee may be eligible for
reimbursement of actual meal expenses up to a maximum of thirty-five dollars
($35.00), depending on the time of departure and return, as follows:
         A.   $7.00 for breakfast if traveling between 6:01 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.
         B.   $10.00 for lunch if traveling between 9:01 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
         C.   $18.00 for dinner if traveling between 4:31 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
      (3)   On a single day of travel, meal reimbursement is only authorized
for the time period the individual is traveling. Meal reimbursement will be
made for actual expenditures only. These amounts are not per diems or
entitlements. Gratuities will be reimbursed in addition to the meal allowance
provided they do not exceed the lesser of 15% of the allowable meal expenses or
five dollars($5.00) per day maximum gratuity reimbursement. All expenditures
exceeding the daily maximum of thirty- five dollars ($35.00) are the sole

cash advances will not be made under any circumstance. Any requests for
reimbursement must have proper receipt documentation attached to the
reimbursement request form. If more than one City employee (of the same sex)

TITLE NINE - Judicial
Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
181.01      Nonappearance.
181.02      Conduct during proceedings.
181.03   Court costs.
181.99   Penalty.

181.01 NONAPPEARANCE.
   In any case to be tried in the Mayor's Court, no defendant or other party
required to appear shall fail to appear without proper, reasonable notice or,
having thereafter voluntarily appeared or been brought before the Court by a
bench warrant or other legal arrest, shall fail to explain his nonappearance to
the satisfaction of the Court. Such failure to appear or to explain a
nonappearance shall cause such person to be held in contempt of Court and shall
subject him to the penalty provided in Section
181.99.
181.02 CONDUCT DURING PROCEEDINGS.
   During any session of the Mayor's Court, no person, whether present as a
result of a citation, summons or bench warrant, in the custody of an officer or
as an observer or witness, shall display disruptive conduct or overall demeanor
and action such as would transgress unduly the prestige of the Court. Such
conduct, demeanor or action shall cause such person to be held in contempt of
Court and shall subject him to the penalty provided in Section
181.99.
181.03 COURT COSTS.
   (a)   There is hereby established a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each
traffic and each criminal case filed in the Hubbard Mayor’s Court, subject to
the authority of the Mayor to suspend the collection of such fees, to help
recover the costs incurred in the processing of Complaints in the Hubbard
Mayor’s Court.
   (b)   The Clerk of the Hubbard Mayor’s Court is to post and deposit each fee
collected according to law. (Ord. 62-94. Passed 5-2-94.)
181.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 18-15, effective

resolutions of the Municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and
resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:    
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)   Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
      The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit
that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal
taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating
loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years
than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
         (iv)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.
         (v)   Nothing in division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
191.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
191.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.

the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom

withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

191.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
191.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
191.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
191.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
191.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
191.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
191.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
191.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
191.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   “Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
191.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid

191.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

income tax in another municipality or Joint Economic Development District, he
or she shall be entitled to a credit not greater than one percent (1%) on the
same income subject to the municipal income tax paid in the other municipality
or Joint Economic Development District.
   (B) Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City but receives net
profits, salaries, income, wages, commissions, other personal service
compensation, or a distributive share of net profits from a resident or
nonresident unincorporated business entity or association of which he is a
partner or owner, for work done or services performed or rendered outside of
the City, if it is made to appear that he or she or such business entity has
paid a municipal income tax on or with respect to the same income taxable under
this chapter to another, shall be allowed a credit not greater than one percent
(1%) against the tax imposed by this chapter in the amount so paid by him or
higher, in his or her behalf, or by such business entity, to the other
municipality or Joint Economic Development District. In no event, however,
shall any municipal income tax to the extent paid to another municipality or
Joint Economic Development District and allowed as a credit hereunder be
deductible in computing the net profit of such taxpayer or such business
entity. In addition, the credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this
chapter on income earned in such other municipality or municipalities or Joint
Economic Development Districts where the tax is paid.
   (C)    A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may by regulation provide.

final tax return or other form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, and
presents such evidence, i.e. W-2 form(s) of the payment of a similar tax to
another municipality or Joint Economic Development District.
   (E)    If, after filing a City of Hubbard return and claiming the one
percent (1%) credit on his return, a taxpayer receives a refund of all and/or a
portion of the taxes paid to another municipality or Joint Economic Development
District, the taxpayer is required to file an amended City of Hubbard Tax
Return and pay the appropriate one percent (1%) tax due the City of Hubbard as
reflected by the amended return.
   (F) The Tax Administrator, or any duly authorized agent or employee, may
exchange information with the Tax Administrator or his authorized agent, or
employees or other taxing jurisdictions for the purpose of verifying any claim
for credit by City of Hubbard residents, or for the purpose of verifying any
claims for credit for taxes paid to the City of Hubbard by residents of such
other taxing jurisdictions, and may enter into agreements for such purpose.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 191.081 of this
Chapter.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
191.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
191.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)

taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
191.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this

payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.

generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,

generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
191.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this

support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

191.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)

this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
191.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of section
191.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
191.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
191.10 of this Chapter.

purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
191.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
191.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
191.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
191.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
191.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
191.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
191.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
191.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
191.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 18-15. Passed 10-19-15.)
191.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted in

Council and the City of Hubbard, Ohio and any of its committees leading to such
action, were in meetings open to the public as required by law. (Ord. 18-15.
Passed 10-19-15.)
191.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have

191.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

303.991  COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of

to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

4510.02.

the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

Municipality for purposes of this section.

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become in admissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.

R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
 
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
 
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
 
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
 
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
 
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Fourth degree                             2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the
Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to

admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall

Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under

order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.

violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall

may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons
so issued shall be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not after
fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied with the
order, the Board shall recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification of the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City of Hubbard before a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a
violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and,
where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may
also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the

has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
 545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
 545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by

729.01 PURPOSE.
   Going-out-of-business sales, when used for purposes other than the
liquidation of merchandise acquired in the usual course of business by a bona
fide merchant of the City, are injurious to the peace, health and welfare of
the community. When employed as an established merchandising practice, these
sales cause irreperable injury to merchants not employing such devices, render
uncertain the conditions of employment in retail establishments, reduce the
value of public property in the community and foster destructive and unfair
competition in the business community. These sales, when they are conducted as
established practice, involve an unusual hazard of fraud and misrepresentation.
It is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit going-out-of-business sales as
established merchandising practice and to require such sales to be licensed
solely to liquidate estates and businesses.
(Ord. 29-75. Passed 8-20-75.)

jewelry or like merchandise.
   (b)   "Going-out-of-business sale" means a sale, offering for sale or
advertising for sale of goods, wares or merchandise to the ultimate consumer,
where the offeror or owner implies or the consumer is reasonably led by the
offeror or owner to believe that the owner or offeror will no longer continue
to engage in such business in the City, or that such sale is other than in the
usual and ordinary course of business. (Ord. 29-75. Passed 8-20-75.)
729.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   The provisions of this chapter do not apply to a person who is executing a
process or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

of-business sale any goods, wares or merchandise, whether they are his property
or that of another, without first having obtained a license therefor, issued
under the provisions of this chapter.

the owner of record on file with the Trumbull County Auditor. The Storm Water
Drainage Fee shall be, and is, a monthly service charge and shall be determined
by the Land Use Code set forth by the Storm Water Utility (every attempt has

hardship to any single code group).
   (b)   The Storm Water Drainage Fee for each Residential Unit shall be, and
is, 100% of the approved monthly rate approved by this chapter. In the event of
a newly constructed Unit, the charge for the Storm Water Drainage Fee
attributable to that Unit shall commence upon the issuance of the certificate
of occupancy for that Unit, or if construction is at least fifty percent (50%)
complete and is halted for a period of three (3) months, then that Unit shall
be deemed complete and the Storm Water Drainage Fee shall commence. If any
Residential Unit displays a sign stating that the intended use of that
particular property is for commercial benefit, the rate therefore shall fall
under a commercial rate code. Any adjustment to Storm Water Drainage Fees shall
be subject to the approval of the Service Director, or his designee.

charge for the Storm Water Drainage Fee attributable to that Commercial Unit
shall commence, or increase in the case of additional development to property
which is already Developed Property, upon the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy for such additional development, or in the event that no certificate
of occupancy will be issued for that development, or in the event development
has halted, then on the date that the Service Director, or the Service
Director's designee, determines that said development is substantially complete
or has been halted for at least three (3) months. Any adjustment to Storm Water
Drainage Fees shall be subject to approval by the Service Director, or his
designee.

100% of the Rate approved by this chapter. In the event of a newly developed
Industrial Unit, the charge for the Storm Water Drainage Fee attributable to
that Industrial Unit shall commence, or increase in the case of additional
development to property which is already Developed Property, upon the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy for such additional development, or in the
event that no certificate of occupancy will be issued for that development, or
in the event development has halted, then on the date that the Service
Director, or the Service Director's designee, determines that said development
is substantially complete or has been halted for at least three (3) months. Any
adjustment to Storm Water Drainage Fees shall be subject to approval by the
Service Director, or his designee.

of the rate approved by this chapter. In the event of a newly developed Public
Unit, the charge for the Storm Water Drainage Fee attributable to that Public
Unit shall commence, or increase in the case of additional development to
property which is already Developed Property, upon the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy for such additional development, or in the event that
no certificate of occupancy will be issued for that development, or in the
event development has halted, then on the date that the Service Director, or
the Service Director's designee, determines that said development is
substantially complete or has been halted for at least three (3) months. Any
adjustment to Storm Water Drainage Fees shall be subject to approval by the
Service Director, or his designee.
   (f)   The Storm Water Drainage Fee for each Vacant Improved Property shall
be, and is, 100% of the Rate based on the intended use and approved by the
Storm Water Board, subject to review by the Director or his designee upon
written request. Any adjustment to Storm Water Drainage Fees shall be subject
to approval by the Service Director, or his designee.
   (g)   No fee shall be imposed on any exempt property until such time that it
no longer exists as exempt property. At that time the property will then be
assigned non-exempt status and will then be subject to monthly fees per this
chapter.
   (h)   Appeal of Drainage Fees. Any person who disagrees with a Storm Water
Drainage Fee as provided in this chapter may appeal same to the Storm Water
Board. Any appeal must be in writing, and shall state specific objections or
errors. The Storm Water Board shall review the appeal and issue a written
recommendation to the Service Director as soon as practicable. The decisions of
the Service Director or his designee shall be final. The decision of the
Service Director or the Service Director's designee shall be communicated to
the Storm Water Board and the Appellant, in writing, within ten (10) working
days of receiving the Board's recommendation. Decisions that vary with the
recommendation of the Storm Water Board shall include specifics as to the
varying decision.
   (i)   Should any Commercial Unit or Industrial Unit (newly developed or
existing) take appropriate action to resolve storm water run off in accordance
with the Storm Water Management Plan, it may receive a credit in the form of a
reduction or complete waiver of any and all fees associated with the Storm
Water Drainage Fee upon review and approval by the Storm Water Board and the
Service Director.
   (j)   In an effort to provide for future capital projects (Operation,
Maintenance Repair and Extension of the Collection System) beyond the initial
startup of the Storm Water Utility, the following rate schedule shall, and
does, apply. Such rate schedule should prevent the need for initial OWDA loans
and should provide additional working capital in the short term. Rates for
Units for the Storm Water Utility, as stated on the following rate schedule,
are stated on a monthly basis:
Rate Matrix - Monthly Charge by Property Classification
 
Residential Commercial and Multi Industrial Public Vacant Improved Property

(Ord. 33-07. Passed 12-26-07.)
933.06 STORM WATER DRAINAGE FEE COLLECTION.
   (a)   The Storm Water Drainage Fee shall be billed and collected monthly
with the monthly City's Utility bill. For those properties utilizing multi-
portions of the Utility bill (Water, Sewerage, Storm Water and Electric),
billing shall be consolidated and paid by single payment. In the event that
partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied according to the
existing policy on partial utility payments. All bills for Storm Water Drainage
Fees shall become due and payable in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the City of Hubbard pertaining to the collection of the Storm Water Drainage
Fees and the existing utility terms of payment ordinance.
   (b)   Any charge hereunder which shall not be paid when due may be recovered
in an action at law by the City of Hubbard. In addition to any other remedies
or penalties provided by this chapter or any other ordinance of the City of
Hubbard, failure of any user of City Utilities to pay said charges for same
promptly when due shall subject such user to discontinuance of Utility Services
and the Service Director or the Service Director's designee shall enforce this
provision as to any and all delinquent users. Employees of the City of Hubbard
(upon reasonable advance notice) shall, at all reasonable times, have access to
any premises served by the City for inspection, repair or the enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   All Storm Water Drainage Fees assessed pursuant to this chapter shall
become a lien upon the property to which such fee is associated from the date
said fee becomes due until such fee is paid. The owner of every building,
premise, lot or house shall be obligated to pay the fees for all services
provided for his premises, which obligation may be enforced by the City by
action at law or suit to enforce the lien in the same manner as the foreclosure
of mortgages. In the event of such action, the City shall be entitled to
recover all court costs and reasonable attorney fees for such collection. In
the case that a tenant in possession of any premises or building shall pay said
charges, it shall relieve the owner from such obligation and lien, but the City
shall not be required to look to any person whatsoever other than the owner for
payment of such charges. No changes of ownership or occupation shall affect the
application of this chapter, and failure of any owner to learn that he
purchased property against which a lien for Storm Water Drainage Fees exists
shall in no way affect his responsibility for such payment. (Ord. 33-07. Passed
12-26-07.)
933.07 CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR REGIONAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   Present or future City ordinances may require construction of on-site
storm water management facilities to control storm water quantity and quality
in the event of development. Implementation of regional storm water management
facilities may, in some cases, render construction of on-site facilities
unnecessary. For use in these cases, the City shall adopt procedures and
standards to require developers of land to provide a one-time capital
contribution toward construction of regional storm water management facilities
in lieu of construction of on-site storm water facilities. Such one-time
contribution shall not affect the obligation for payment of any Storm Water
Drainage Fee assessed pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   The one-time capital contribution may be available to a development
that meets the following conditions:
      (1)   An adopted drainage basin study has identified an area within which
the storm water management facilities normally required to be created on-site
are unnecessary; and
      (2)   The development is located within an area so identified; and
      (3)   Implementation of regional storm water facilities required by the
adopted drainage basin study is complete or under construction.
   (c)   For developments which meet the conditions specified previously in
this section, the Director, upon review of the development plans, shall require
a development agreement which shall be presented for final approval to City
Council.
   (d)   The amount of a one-time capital contribution shall be based upon that
percentage of the regional storm water management facility capacity which is to
be allocated to the development. (Ord. 33-07. Passed 12-26-07.)
933.08 STORM WATER UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND.
   (a)   All Storm Water Drainage Fees collected by the City shall be paid into
an enterprise fund known as "Storm Water Utility Fund". Such fund shall be used
for the purpose of paying the costs of operation, administration and
maintenance of the storm water management facilities of the City and to carry
out all other purposes of the utility. To the extent that the Storm Water
Drainage Fees collected are insufficient to construct the needed storm water
drainage facilities, the cost of the same may be paid from such City fund as
may be determined by City Council, but City Council may order the reimbursement
of such fund if additional fees are thereafter collected.
   (b)   The fees and charges paid shall not be used for general or other
governmental or proprietary purposes of the City, except to pay for the
equitable share of the cost of accounting, management and government thereof.
Other than as described above, the fees and charges shall be used solely for
the purpose stated previously in this section.
(Ord. 33-07. Passed 12-26-07.)

to participate in program development and implementation, including effectively
publicizing public hearings and/or encouraging citizen representatives on the
Storm Water Board.
   (c)   Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination. Developing and
implementing a plan to detect and eliminate illicit discharges to the storm
sewer system (shall include developing a system map and informing the community
about hazards associated with illegal discharges and improper disposal of
waste).
   (d)   Construction Site Runoff Control. Developing, implementing and
enforcing an erosion and sediment control program for construction activities
that disturb more than one acre of land (controls shall include silt fences or
temporary storm water detention ponds).
   (e)   Post Construction Runoff Control. Developing, implementing and
enforcing an erosion and sediment control program to address discharges of
post-construction storm water runoff from new development and redevelopment

for three or more consecutive months; and/or having written two or more
nonsufficient fund checks for delinquent utility services in the past twelve

City’s opinion, there is reasonable cause to believe that the customer is
receiving utility service without paying therefore, or the meter(s), wires, or
other connecting apparatus have in any manner been tampered with, damaged, or
suspected of damage, in such ways as to prevent the meter(s) from recording the
amount of utility service consumed by the customer.
   (k)   The City reserves the right to terminate utility service, when, in the
City’s opinion, the condition of the customer’s wiring, plumbing, equipment,

utility service, or when the customer’s use of a utility service or equipment
interferes with or may be detrimental to the supply of utility service by the
City to any of its other customers.
   (l)   The City reserves the right to terminate utility service, when, in the
City’s opinion, utility service is being provided over a line which is not
owned by the City or leased by the City and such line is either not in a safe
and suitable condition or is inadequate to receive said utility service.
   (m)   The City reserves the right to terminate utility service, when, in the

City’s water or electric meter and all associated wiring and other apparatus

Terms of Payment in Section
939.04 in order to avoid service disconnection for nonpayment.
      (2)   All charges for utilities must continue to be paid until the
disputed bill process is complete.
      (3)   Upon completion of the disputed bill procedure, the resident will
receive either a credit (refund of charges collected by the City) or debit
(charge for charges not yet collected by the City) to their respective utility
account based on the terms of the resolution of the disputed bill.
   (b)   If a resident disputes a utility bill, one of the following options
must be pursued in order to remedy the dispute:
      (1)   Request a meeting with the respective utility department
superintendent and the Service Director and/or Mayor in order to discuss the
reason(s) for disputing the bill and to determine the appropriate course of
corrective action.
      (2)   Request that the meter be tested.
         A.   If the meter is tested and found to be inaccurately registering
utility consumption, the utility department shall replace the meter, adjust the
utility bill amount due by calculating consumption for the billing period in
question based on average usage for the twelve months preceding the disputed
period; all of these services will be provided at no cost to the customer. Said
retroactive billing adjustments shall not be for more than ninety days prior to
the originating date of the dispute.
         B.   If the meter is tested and found to register within the tolerance
limits as defined by the relevant industry standard meter specifications, the
customer is charged sixty dollars ($60.00) for each meter tested. Based upon
the meter test reports neither the Utility Billing Office, Service Director,
nor Mayor can further recommend adjustment of the given disputed bill. If other
sufficient evidence of mitigating effects on the metering or billing process is
provided, a hearing concerning the disputed bill shall be set before the
Utility Review Board.
      (3)   If the disputed bill contains consumption/usage that is more than
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the average usage during the immediately
preceding twelve months, a hearing before the Utility Review Board as
established and governed by the appropriate City Ordinance, may be requested by
the customer.
         A.   For example: a customer account’s average bills indicate water
consumption of 10 ft3/month, the disputed bill in question indicates usage of
18 ft3. As a result of 18 ft3 exceeding the 150% of the 10 ft3 average, the
customer may request a hearing.
         B.   In the event a twelve-month history is not available, the usage
must exceed the respective industry standard average by 50% or more.
         C.   All requests for hearings must occur within thirty days (30) of
receipt of the bill.
         D.   Special Circumstances Hearings may be heard before the Utility
Review Board for situations and accounts not meeting the minimum qualifying
standards as established above. Such Special Circumstance Hearings will be
determined on a case-by-case basis as deemed necessary by the Service Director
and/or Mayor.
         E.   Customers will be limited to no more than one (1) Special
Circumstance Hearing in any given calendar year.
   (c)   All resolutions resulting from the above process shall be final and
binding.
   (d)   All fees and charges resulting from disputed bill procedures cannot be
waived under any circumstances. (Ord. 11-03. Passed 6-2-03.)
939.08 PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT POLICY.
   (a)   All current utility service charges must be paid in full by the
twenty-fifth calendar day of the current billing month as defined in Section
939.04.
   (b)   Customers who are unable to meet their financial obligation for
utility service resulting from temporary circumstances; such as unemployment,
death in family, extended illness, or abnormally high medical expenses; are
encouraged to seek appropriate financial institution or social service agency
assistance in order to meet the requirements of their utility charges for the
current period in order to avoid the delinquency deadline and service
termination/shut-off proceedings.
   (c)   Individuals must provide written evidence and the City must verify by
the twenty- fifth day of the current billing month that arrangements have been
made between the customer and a bonafide social service agency or financial
institution to meet the complete financial obligation of the current and any
delinquent utility charges.
   (d)   Upon receipt of the written evidence and verification of payment
assistance by the Utility Billing Office, the City shall extend the shut-off
date for the given individual by an additional twenty calendar days.
Individuals may seek not more than two payment assistance payment extensions in
a calendar year.
   (e)   No extension will be granted based on personal credit or promises to
pay by individual utility customers unless said arrangements are paid in full
in cash by the final collection date of the current billing period (i.e. the
twenty-fifth calendar day of the current billing month.)
   (f)   All payment assistance payment extensions must be placed in writing;
signed by both the customer and City Service Director and filed with Utility
Billing Office.
   (g)   Failure of the social service agency or financial institution to remit
payment within twenty calendar days will subject the customer to proceedings
under the Disconnection for Non- Payment/Shut-Off section of this ordinance.
   (h)   If the social service agency or financial institution cannot guarantee
payment in full within the twenty-day time limit, written notice from the
institution must accompany the application for payment assistance payment
extension and explicitly state when payment will be remitted to the City.
   (i)   The City shall maintain and provide upon request by the customer a
list of social service agencies and financial institutions for customers to
contact if payment assistance is needed.
   (j)   Utility services that have already been disconnected for non-payment
are not eligible for payment extensions. All charges associated with said
accounts must be paid in full in cash prior to service reestablishment.
   (k)   Payment arrangements are limited only to those circumstances which are
temporary and therefore as limited to two requests per calendar year.
   (l)   Continuing requests for payment arrangements will not be accepted.
Once payment arrangement options as established above are exhausted, service
termination for nonpayment/shut off procedures shall result.

945.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level
of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Hubbard:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Hubbard to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Hubbard future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
945.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Trumbull County, and the
City of Hubbard shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the City of Hubbard Engineer. Such projects must be designed
to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1377, Erosion and Sediment Control.

945.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding; to maintain predevelopment runoff
patterns, flows, and volumes; by ensuring compliance with all performance
standards set forth in the most recent edition of the Tnembull County Drainage
and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water conveyance
practices shall be designed to the storm drainage systems requirements as set
forth in the most recent edition of the Trumbull County Drainage and Erosion
and Sedimentation Control Manual, to convey storm water to allow for the
maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities.
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control: All storm water quality control practices
shall be designed utilizing the post-construction storm water quality control
method and recommended post-construction best management practices as set forth
in the most recent edition of the Trumbull County Drainage and Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Manual and shall meet the following general performance
standard:
      (1)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction BMPs:
The applicant may request approval from the City of Hubbard Engineer for the
use of alternative structural post-construction BMPs if the applicant shows to
the satisfaction of the City of Hubbard Engineer that these BMPs are equivalent
in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in the most recent edition of the Trumbull County Drainage and Erosion
and Sedimentation Control Manual. If the site is greater than five (5) acres,
or less than five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or
sale which will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio
EPA is necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative BMP has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected BMP is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the BMP will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
   The storm water drainage system of the development discharges directly into
a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where the
development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has identified water
quality problems in the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management practices are
designed to meet the post-construction storm water quantity control method
requirement as set forth in the most recent edition of the Trumbull County
Drainage and Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual for storm water quantity
control for each watershed in the development:
   (e)   Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects: Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans shall be designed to the requirements as set forth in
the most recent edition of the Trumbull County Drainage and Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Manual.

objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential

1345.01 ABANDONED STRUCTURE DEFINED; DECLARATION OF NUISANCE.
   (a)    As used in this chapter "abandoned structure" means any building,
either constructed or in a partially constructed state, which is permitted to
remain uninhabitable for a period of at least six months. Examples of elements
which shall determine whether or not a structure has been abandoned are any of
the following conditions, but such determination shall not necessarily be
controlled by these illustrations: premises where a structure is located and
windows are broken; or where trash is permitted to accumulate; or where grass
and weeds are permitted to grow without being mowed; or where further
construction is needed to make such premises habitable; or where taxes remain
unpaid on such a structure. This section does not apply to structures or
buildings under construction with current and valid building permits issued by
the appropriate agencies.
   (b)    Every abandoned structure, as defined in subsection (a) hereof, is
hereby declared to be a nuisance in that such a structure becomes a breeding
place for rats, is an attractive nuisance to the children of the City and
depreciates property values of surrounding property owners. (Ord. 9-13. Passed
6-3-13.)
1345.02 INSPECTION OF ABANDONED, INSECURE, UNSAFE OR STRUCTURALLY DEFECTIVE
STRUCTURES; NOTICE TO CORRECT; EXTENSION OF TIME.
   Whenever the City of Hubbard, by and through the City of Hubbard Engineer or
his/her agents or designees (collectively hereafter referred to as the
Engineer) has probable cause to believe that a structure is an abandoned
structure, as defined in Section
1345.01(a) of the City of Hubbard Building Code, or is insecure, unsafe or
structurally defective under Sections 715.26 and 715.261 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the Engineer shall make an inspection of the structure. If, in the
Engineer's opinion, arrived at by following the aforementioned code sections,
the structure is deemed abandoned, insecure, unsafe or structurally defective,
the Engineer shall cause written notice to be served. At least thirty days
prior to the removal, demolition or repair of any abandoned, insecure, unsafe,
or structurally defective building, the City of Hubbard, or its agent pursuant
to Section 715.261(E) of the Ohio Revised Code shall give notice by certified
mail of its intention with respect to removal, demolition or repair to the
holders of legal or equitable liens of record upon the real property upon which
the structure is located and to the owners of record of such property. The
owners or lienholders shall be given a period of 30 days to finish construction
or make the structure fit for habitation. An extension of this time period may
be granted in writing by the Engineer if a bona fide and continuous effort has
been made to correct the condition of the structure. The owners of record of
such property or the holders of liens of record upon such property may enter
into an agreement with the City of Hubbard, or a county land reutilization
corporation organized under Chapter 1724 of the Ohio Revised Code that is
serving as the City of Hubbard's agent, to perform the removal or repair of the
insecure, unsafe, or structurally defective building. If an emergency exists,
as determined by the City of Hubbard, notice may be given other than by
certified mail and less than thirty days prior to such removal or repair. If
for any reason notice is not given, the lien provided for in Ohio R.C. 715.261
as a result of such removal or repair is valid but shall be subordinate to any
liens of prior record. If notice is provided in accordance with this section, a
lien under Ohio R.C. 715.261 for such removal or repair is effective on the
date the City of Hubbard or county land reutilization corporation incurred
expenses in such removal or repair. No person shall fail to comply with such
notice within the stipulated time period.
(Ord. 9-13. Passed 6-3-13.)
1345.03 DEMOLITION OF ABANDONED STRUCTURES; EQUITABLE REMEDY.
   (a)   If no effort has been made to comply with the notice provided for in
Section
1345.02 the City Engineer shall report the lack of such effort to Council.
Council shall then, by ordinance, order the abandoned structure to be torn down
within thirty days from the passage of such ordinance and notice of the passage
of such ordinance shall be sent by registered mail to the owner of such
abandoned structure.
   (b)   If such structure is not demolished within the time specified, the
City shall cause such structure to be demolished by whatever means the Engineer
advises, and the costs of such demolition shall be charged to such owner and
shall be certified to the County Auditor for collection against the real
property of the owner.
   (c)   Such remedy shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1345.99.
(Ord. 214. Passed 10-18-65.)
1345.04 ABANDONED SERVICE STATIONS.
   (a)   Definition. As used in this section, "abandoned service station" means
any service station which has not been operative for at least four consecutive
months in any twelve-month period.
   (b)   Declaration of Nuisance. Every abandoned service station is hereby
declared to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, and must be abated.
   (c)   Notice to Owner. When the City Engineer finds that a service station
is abandoned, as defined in subsection (a) hereof, he shall forthwith notify
the owner of the premises of the violation of this section and shall state in
such notice that the service station shall be either made operative within
sixty days or that it shall be denied such use as was previously granted.
   (d)   Abatement by City Engineer. The City Engineer is hereby authorized to
take all legal measures to raze abandoned service stations and abate the
nuisance.
   (e)   Additional Prohibitions. The parking of motor vehicles or permitting
weeds to grow is hereby prohibited on the grounds of any service station which
has been inoperative for a period of more than sixty days. A sign shall be
placed in the window of such inoperative station to that effect.
(Ord. 8-70. Passed 3-16-70.)
1345.05 CONDEMNATION OF UNSAFE BUILDINGS AUTHORIZED.
   The City Engineer is hereby authorized to issue condemnation orders against
any property owner in the City who permits or suffers to remain on his premises
any building which the Engineer deems unsafe for human habitation or use. (Ord.
26. Passed 4-16-62.)
1345.06 NOTICE TO REPAIR, ALTER OR TEAR DOWN UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Whenever the City Engineer deems that a building is unsafe, he shall
forthwith issue notice, in writing, served by registered mail or by leaving
such notice at the residence of the offending owner, stating the manner of the
violation and ordering the owner to make the necessary repairs or alterations
to make the building safe or to tear down such building. The offending owner
shall have thirty days to comply with the order unless for reasonable cause an
extension of time is granted by the Engineer.
   (b)   No person shall fail to comply with such order within the stipulated
period.
(Ord. 26. Passed 4-16-62.)
1345.07 DEMOLITION OF UNSAFE BUILDINGS BY CITY.

alterations or to demolish such building as required by Section
1345.06, the City may, after notice has been served as provided in Section
1345.06, hire a wrecking company to demolish such building or may demolish the
same by force account, and in any event the costs of such demolition shall then
be charged to the owner and a bill for such charges shall be sent to him. Upon
his failure to pay such bill within sixty days, the costs of demolition shall
be certified to the County Auditor for collection against the real property of
the owner.
   (b)   Such remedy shall be in addition to the penalty provided in Section
1345.99.
(Ord. 26. Passed 4-16-62.)
1345.08 FIRE-DAMAGED STRUCTURE; REMOVAL OR REPAIR FUND.
   (a)   No insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of
a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the City where
the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure, under all insurance
policies, exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), and is greater than or equal
to sixty percent (60%) of all fire insurance policy monetary limitations unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent
(60%) of the aggregate limits or liability on all fire polices covering the
building or structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the City
Auditor, in the aggregate amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and each fraction of that amount, of a claim,
or, if at that time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or
insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or insureds
have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
         Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the City may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
         The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer and the City Auditor, after notifying the City
Engineer or Building Inspector, shall return the amount of the fund in excess
of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the City has
not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the City Auditor shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred
by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         When transferring the fund as required in subsection (a) hereof, an
insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named

1349.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Hubbard, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Hubbard has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Hubbard as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by Hubbard.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map, Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
both effective June 18,2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, flood ways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Hubbard as required by Section
1349.04 (c).
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 220 West Liberty Street, Hubbard, Ohio 44425.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Hubbard, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal
Emergency Management
Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 8-10. Passed 4-19-10.)
1349.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areasfrom:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
(1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation, plus one [1] foot. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodwav:  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Hubbard's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine f1ood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Hubbard Flood
Insurance Rate Map, August 15, 1978, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 8-10. Passed 4-19-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Hubbard's flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1349.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter flood way boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment ofbase flood elevations in accordance with Section
1349.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Hubbard,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Hubbard have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Hubbard's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Hubbard
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Hubbard suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Hubbard has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1349.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1349.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Hubbard and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of"bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Hubbard specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section 1349.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results
in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including
the placement of culverts.

Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the City of
Hubbard, Ohio, Tmmbull County.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within forty (40) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be published, for two successive weeks
prior thereto, in two newspapers of general circulation in the City of Hubbard,
Ohio.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. 1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Procedure at Hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
      (6)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Trumbull Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1355.01 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   All provisions of this chapter shall apply to all applicants for conditional
zoning certificates for oil and gas well permits. Certain provisions shall also
apply to applicants for brine disposal site permits as specified in Section
1355.30. The heirs, executors or assigns of any individual permittee, and the
successors and assigns of any firm, partnership, association or corporate
permittee, as fully bound by these provisions as the original permittee. All
references to oil and/or gas shall be understood to include any other
hydrocarbon products of such well drilling operations.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91)
1355.02 INTENT; AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter, in addition to prescribing minimum
standards, to make drilling as safe as possible within the City, and also to
cause drilling activity to be carried on in those zoning districts where they
are specifically listed as a conditionally permitted use.
   (b)   The City is aware of the difficulty in setting rigid rules as to the
areas to be included in any one unit. It is the intent of this chapter to have
property drilled, when reasonable and expedient in the City's judgment, on one
permit encompassing all appropriate and compatible properties and to prevent
the withholding of permission by a landowner for the sole purpose of later
requesting individual permission to drill on the same lot or area.
   (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission is herewith given full authority to
impose such requirements as it shall deem necessary to give full force and
effect to the intent as expressed in subsection (a) hereof. Each application
for a permit shall rest solely upon its merits and the prudent use of
discretion by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate each application for
a permit according to procedures detailed in 13.07 of the Zoning Ordinance and
Subdivision Regulations of Hubbard, Ohio.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.03 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   No person, corporation or other entity shall commence to drill a well
for oil, gas or other hydrocarbons or develop a site for deep well brine
injection within the corporate limits of the City until such time as the person
has wholly complied with all provisions of this chapter and a conditional
zoning certificate has been granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. This
conditional zoning certificate will expire one year after the date of issue if
actual on-site drilling has not begun. The Planning and Zoning Commission may,
for good cause, grant an extension up to one year, without holding a public
hearing. No well, or wells, shall begin production until compliance with all
provisions are certified by the Fire Chief and the Zoning Inspector.
   (b)   No person shall be permitted to drill more than two oil/gas wells at
any one time. Application for the third permit or any subsequent permits, may
be made upon completion of the drilling of the first, second and each
numerically subsequent well.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.04 PERMIT APPLICATION; FEE.
   Any person desiring to drill a well for oil or gas or develop a deep well
brine injection site within the corporate limits of the City shall make
application for a conditional zoning certificate to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. All requests for permits must be completed at the time of the time
of the application. A fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per well shall be
paid at the time the application is filed. No refund of any part of a permit
fee shall be made to any permit holder for a dry hole or for failure to
exercise the privilege to drill upon the site covered by the permit.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.05 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission will, before granting a conditional
zoning certificate, schedule a public hearing, the date and time of which shall
be established by the Planning and Zoning Commission and shall cause all
property owners and residents within 500 feet of the well-head to be notified
of such hearing, in writing, all by regular mail and notice shall be given of
such hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in Hubbard.
The notice must carry a map showing the specific location of the well. The
public hearing must occur not less than three weeks prior to the commencement
of drilling. It shall be sufficient notice to all of the residents of any one
residential unit to address notice to "Resident or Residents" at the mailing
address of the residential unit.
   (b)   In addition thereto, the developer shall notify the Zoning Inspector
forty-eight hours prior to actual drilling.
   (c)   Compliance with the hearing provisions of this chapter shall be
mandatory conditions precedent to the commencement of drilling under the
permit.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.06 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   At the time of the application, every applicant shall deposit with the
City a performance bond conditional upon compliance with this chapter. The
amount of the bond, not less than two thousand dollars ($2,000), will be set by
the Planning and Zoning Commission upon issuance of the conditional zoning
certificate.
   (b)   The bond shall not only be conditioned upon compliance by the
applicant, but also upon compliance with this chapter by any assignee and owner
of any permit granted hereunder, or any employee, contractor, subcontractor or
other party performing services in connection with any permit issued hereunder.
Bond shall be released when wells and tank batteries have been removed and
premises restored to pre-drilling conditions.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.07 DRILLING NEAR STRUCTURES; EXCEPTIONS.
   No drilling shall be permitted for oil or gas wells within 300 feet of
residential structures, mercantile buildings or any school, church, hospital,
theatre or assembly hall, as the same are defined by the Ohio Revised Code,
regardless of the zone. In the case of particular installations where
compliance with the foregoing distance requirements may be a handicap to the
use of the property and where no undue hazard will be created, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may, with waivers as required in Section
1355.09, reduce the distance to not less than 200 feet. Any reduction in
distance must be based upon a consideration of the special features such as
topographical conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the
adjoining property, proximity of storage tanks, degree of fire protection
provided and the facilities available at fire departments to cope with
controlling liquid fires. The above features are not to be in any way construed
as a limitation of matters which the Planning and Zoning Commission may
consider. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the right to consider
any and all other special features it may consider important in determining
whether or not an undue hazard is created.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.08 CONSENT FROM PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN 500 FEET.
   (a)   All applicants for a permit to drill for oil and/or gas in
nonindustrial and industrial zoned areas in the City shall be accompanied by
consents in writing of owners of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the real
estate units located within a radius of 500 feet from the proposed drilling
site. The consents shall plainly state that the persons whose signatures are
affixed thereto do give their consent to the drilling of a well for oil or gas
on the site as proposed in the application for a drilling permit. Measurement
for determination of the distance of the aforesaid 500 feet shall be made from
the exact center of the hold that is to be drilled for the well. As used in
this section, the term "real estate unit" means a land area with a common
ownership irrespective as to how it may be divided among lots.
   (b)   In the event that the owner of any property abutting a proposed well
site:
      (1)   Has leased his property for drilling for oil or gas;
      (2)   Has signed and filed an application for a permit to drill for oil
or gas on his property, or his lessee, contractor or agent has signed and filed
the application;
      (3)   Has signed and delivered a written assent under Section
1355.08 through
1355.09 to an application for a permit to drill a well for oil or gas; or
      (4)   Has utilized his property by entering into a community lease or
agreement for drilling a well for oil or gas, if the well to which he has
assented or which is to be drilled under the community lease or agreement is to
be located nearer to his property than the well or proposed well site mentioned
in this section, then the owner shall not be permitted to object, but shall be
deemed to have given his written assent, under the provisions of this section,
to drilling a well for oil and/or gas on the proposed well site first mentioned
above.
   However, any owner who has united his property by entering into a community
lease or agreement as set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section, shall not
share in any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of
the real estate caused by the real estate being in more than one unitized area.
It is the expressed intention of this provision to prohibit an owner of
property from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease
or agreement.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.09 WAIVERS FROM OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS WITHIN 300 FEET.
   (a)   In addition to the consents required in Section
1355.08, no drilling shall be permitted for oil and/or gas wells in any zone
within 300 feet of any building or structure of any nature unless written
waivers as hereinafter provided for, accompany an application for a drilling
permit.
   (b)   The owners and occupants of any building or structures which are
located within 300 feet of the proposed well site must waive, in writing, the
distance set forth. The owners and occupants may waive down to a minimum
distance of 200 feet without the necessity of vacating or causing to be
vacated, any buildings or structures during drilling operations.
   (c)   The owners and occupants of any buildings or structures of any nature
may consent to drilling for oil and/or gas to a minimum distance of 100 feet to
the buildings or structures, but in these cases, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider special features affecting the application for a
drilling permit, such as a topographical condition nature of occupancy and
proximity of buildings on the abutting property, facilities available at the
Fire Department to cope with controlling liquid fires and such other matters as
the City shall deem relevant to the application. Should the Planning and Zoning
Commission, upon considering the special features, find that an undue hazard is
created, then irrespective of waivers being provided, as called for in this
section, the City may refuse to issue a permit to drill. The denial of the
permit and the undue hazard created shall be recorded in the minutes of the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)   Where the owners and occupants of any buildings or structures which
are closer than 200 feet to a proposed drilling site have, at any time, waived,
in writing, the distance requirement provided in this section for any proposed
drilling site which was closer than 300 feet to the buildings or structures,
then the property owners shall be deemed to have waived the distance
requirement provided for in this section down to the same distance that the
party waived for the other proposed drilling site or to the distance that a
well actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
   (e)   All distances as set forth in this section shall be those distances as
measured from the exact center of a proposed drilling site.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1335.10  PLOT PLAN AND VICINITY MAP.
   Each application for a drilling permit must be accompanied by a plot plan
and vicinity map of the area involved in the application drawn to scale and
showing thereon:
   (a)   The lot lines of all properties within 1,000 feet of the proposed well
site;
   (b)   The location of all buildings and structures within 500 feet of the
proposed well site;
   (c)   The location of all associated wells and appliances, that is, the
wellhead, piping, tank batteries, access roads, drives or fences;
   (d)   A landscaping plan drawn to reasonable scale as required unless
specifically waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission;

proposed well site;
   (f)   A circle drawn on the map at a radius of 100 feet, 200 feet, 300 feet,
500 feet, and 1,000 feet from the proposed well site;
   (g)   A schematic of all pipelines, connections and shutoff valves for
emergency purposes. The schematic shall be modified and resubmitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for informational purposes at any time that a
change in either pipeline locations, connections or shutoff valves occur;
   (h)   A listing of the name, address and telephone number of the firm and/or
individuals making the permit application; and
   (i)   If the request for a drilling permit is part of a large planned
drilling area, the applicant must submit a plan upon which is shown the

   An applicant for a permit shall be required to file with the application an
affidavit stating that the applicant has complied with all conditions of this
chapter and setting forth any exceptions thereto. Any false statements in the

(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.12 EASEMENTS OR OPTIONS FOR PIPELINES AND STORAGE TANKS.
   An applicant who has received a conditional zoning certificate and has
realized a producing well shall submit to the Director of Public Service copies

for a location for storage tanks, should there be a producing well.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)

dated March, 1981, or thereafter.
(Ord. 17-91. Passed 3-4-91.)
1355.15 PERMIT ISSUANCE, LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (a)   Upon approval by a majority of the Planning and Zoning Commission of a
conditional zoning certificate, the Zoning Inspector shall issue the permit
applied for. However, prior to the issuance, the City shall be provided with a

pulled and plugged as hereinafter provided. The insurance policies and the
coverages thereunder must be in the complete satisfaction of the City and such
policies may be rejected by the City for any valid reason. The rejection of the
insurance policies by the City shall serve to stay the granting of a permit
theretofore approved by it until such time as an insurance policy providing
coverage entirely satisfactory to the City has been provided by the applicant.
   (b)   All insurance coverage shall include coverage for all items specified
in this chapter including coverage resulting from blowout and cratering.

as defined in the subsequent sections of this chapter, and unless the
provisions of such subsequent sections are complied with.
(Ord. 1564. Passed 2-21-55.)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation occurs or continues.
(Ord. 10-77. Passed 3-26-77.)
1357.03 STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS.
   Any structure or building or any portion thereof used for human habitation
shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition by reason of any
portion of such building being infected with a communicable disease, or by
reason of the absence therein of toilet facilities as required by law or by
reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or thereon and also be deemed
unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or harmful to the lives
or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited portion of the house
being damp or wet, or by reason of lack of repair, or by reason of an
accumulation of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous
substances or liquids, or by reason of defects in, lack of repair of, or
improper use of, the drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or by reason of the
existence on the premises of such a nuisance or other condition as is likely to
cause sickness among the occupants. Any structure or building or any portion
thereof used for human habitation which is in such unclean or unsanitary
condition is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance.
(Ord. 1564. Passed 2-21-55.)
1357.04 ORDER FOR ABATEMENT OR VACATION OF PREMISES.
   (a)   Whenever the County Board of Health ascertains from examination or
reports of its inspectors or sanitary officers or other agents that a public
nuisance exists as defined in Section
1357.03, in or upon any structure or building or portion thereof and is of the
opinion that such nuisance may be abated without immediate vacation of the
premises or such portion thereof and serves notice upon the owner of such
house, or his lessee or agent or the person in possession, charge or control
thereof, directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the unclean or
unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by such Board
and specified in such notice, it shall then be the duty of such owner, agent or
person to abate such nuisance within such time.
   (b)   Whenever such abatement does not take place within such time or,
whenever, in the opinion of such Board, such abatement is impossible or
impracticable without an immediate vacation of the house or portion thereof,
and such Board serves notice upon the owner, lessee, agent or person in
possession, charge or control thereof to vacate or cause the vacation of such
house or portion thereof designated in the notice, then it shall be the duty of
such owner, lessee, agent or person to vacate or cause the vacation of such

appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of such order or notice and the
abatement of the nuisance against which such order or notice was directed, such

resolution, direct the owner, occupant or person in charge of such land to
abate such nuisance within ten days, setting forth the nature of the violation

CHAPTER 1373
Standards for Rehabilitation
1373.01   Standards adopted.
1373.02   Goals and general standards for storefront renovations.
 
 
1373.01 STANDARDS ADOPTED.
   The City of Hubbard, Ohio, hereby adopts and enacts the Secretary of the
Interior Standards for Rehabilitation. The Standards (Department of Interior
regulations, 36 CFR 67) pertain to historic buildings of all materials,
construction types, sizes, and occupancy and encompass the exterior and the
interior, related landscape features and the building’s site and environment as
well as attached, adjacent, or related new construction. The standards are to
be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking
into consideration economic and technical feasibility.
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
   (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
   (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
   (h)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of
the property and its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      (Ord. 13-05. Passed 5-2-05.)
1373.02 GOALS AND GENERAL STANDARDS FOR STOREFRONT RENOVATION.
   (a)   Goal. The goal of Storefront Renovation is to make visual improvements
to the main exterior elevations of commercial structures which are seen by the
public, keeping Hubbard’s historic commercial center strong. Compliance with
City code is a critical part of renovation.
   (b)   Preservation. It is important to make every attempt possible to
preserve original design elements of commercial buildings and vintage
additions. The possibility of repair should always be considered first before
covering, remodeling, altering or removing any architecturally significant
feature. The Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation are included
in Section
1373.01.
   (c)   Replacement of Features. If it is necessary to replace a significant
architectural feature, new materials should closely match existing material in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.
   (d)   Contemporary Design. It is not a requirement that new (infill)
development attempt to mimic historic architecture. Contemporary design that is
compatible with the surrounding architecture is encouraged as long as it does
not detract from the unity of the surrounding buildings.
   (e)   Cleaning. Use the gentlest means possible when cleaning exterior
surfaces. Sandblasting, chemical treatments and other cleaning methods that
will damage materials should not be undertaken.
   (f)   Fences and Other Accessory Structures. Fences, lighting, benches and
other accessory materials should be compatible with the overall character of
the commercial district. Use of chain-link, vinyl, split rail and other
manufactured rustic materials are discouraged along the street edge.

            (Ord. 10-09. Passed 5-4-09.)
1377.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor "A" will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor "B" will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). .
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)    Non-structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at anyone time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
         Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
   Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one  Within 7 days of the most recent
year or more.                           disturbance.

not within 50 feet of a stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1.
winter.
 
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
“Rainwater and Land Development” or the Field Office Technical Guide available
at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)    Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment-settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment-settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment-settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment-settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and
runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or
inlet protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a
sediment-settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval
from the City of Hubbard Engineer or Trumbull SWCD.
   The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic yards
of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining the
total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment-settling pond and is not co-mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling pond must be
less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one
unit of width
   (> 2:1 length:width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the sediment-
settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. This
limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth.
When designing sediment-settling ponds, the applicant must consider public
safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres.
   Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 2% but <20%
0.125                                20% but <50%
 
      (4)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
Based on site conditions, the City of Hubbard Engineer or Trumbull SWCD may
require additional best management practices to control off site tracking and
dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         C.    Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.    Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1377.09(g).
         E.    Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City of Hubbard Engineer or Trumbull
SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet
disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)    Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.    All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.    No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment-settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.    Where stream crossings for roads. or utilities are necessary and
permitted the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.    Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
      (7)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)    Non-sediment Pollutant Controls. No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials. A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)    Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volumes of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)    Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)    Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)    Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
