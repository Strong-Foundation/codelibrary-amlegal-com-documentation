EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
    This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the same as the prior ordinance.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

186.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)    Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;

The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

(1)(h) of this section to offset qualifying wages.
             (iii)   (a)    For taxable years 2018 and 2019, a person may not
deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation that
levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more than fifty percent (50%) of
the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by division (C)(1)(h)(i) of this
section.
               (b)    Intentionally left blank.

precludes a person from carrying forward, use with respect to any return filed
for a taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that
was not fully utilized by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this

of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         (i)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly

employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts

deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Plain City in any month of
the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Plain City. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Plain City
as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Plain City income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the

failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Plain City the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the Village of Plain City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to
the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at
the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Plain City income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
    (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the Village of Plain City income tax return for that
taxable year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's
length and that there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with
regard to allocation of net profits to the Village of Plain City. A taxpayer
that is required to file a consolidated Village of Plain City income tax return
for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village of Plain City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village of Plain City income
tax return in the same manner as is required under the United States department

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
186.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the Village of Plain City
income tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
(2)(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the Village of Plain City
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
186.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
186.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
           (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
186.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Plain City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Plain City income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter/ordinance on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the Village of Plain City income
tax return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y)
of Section
186.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the Village of Plain City
income tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Plain
City accordance with this chapter/ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated
group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year,
or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Plain City before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax return with the Village of Plain City may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village of Plain City from qualifying
wages shall be considered as paid to the Village of Plain City in equal amounts
on each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid
on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

186.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.

declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of Plain
City including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after

         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability

the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
186.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Plain City under Section
186.05 for that year.
       (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of Plain
City but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar
year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

186.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 8-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
186.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
186.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
           (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
           (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
186.21. 
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
 186.18 (A)(4).

186.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Plain City,
but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Plain City as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Plain City is subject to recovery by

paid to the other municipality, the Village of Plain City shall allow a
nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Plain City
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Plain City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
the Village of Plain City's tax rate. However, if the Village of Plain City's
tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Plain City,
along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 8-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
186.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Plain City changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Plain City. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
    (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
186.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
186.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Plain City. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
186.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Village of Plain City's tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Plain City

claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

186.12 LIMITATIONS.

whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral

limit described in division (C) of this section.
           (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                  (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
186.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                 (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,

186.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Plain City does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
186.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 186.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Village of Plain City income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 8-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
186.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 8-15.
Passed 12-14-15.)
186.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
    
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
                   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Plain
City official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to
whom the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
           (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address;
or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Plain City official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 8-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
186.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Plain City as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Plain City from

claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Plain City
ordinance or state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or

186.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
                  (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this
section shall be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the
performance of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under
the Village of Plain City's income tax ordinance;
            (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

authorized by law;
            (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is

for the income tax levied by the Village of Plain City or for the withholding
of such tax.
           (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised

deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.   
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
187.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
 
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

            (i)   The nature of the services is such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
187.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
187.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
187.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a fairer apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

187.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 187.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (K)(12) and (HH)(1)(c) of Section 187.03 of this
Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the

purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section 186.05 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid
to an employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:

location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
fi led amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise requi red to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
186.05 of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 03-2024. Passed 1-22-24.)
   187.063  CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
 
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
187.03(A) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (A) of Section
187.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
187.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
187.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of

187.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent (22.5%)of the
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent (45%)of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent (67.5%) of the
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety per cent (90%)of the tax liability
for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent (90%)

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
187.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
187.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

and one-half per cent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with the municipal corporation under Section
187.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

187.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   There is no credit allowed for taxes paid to other municipalities.
(Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
187.082 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
187.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.

beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.

paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced credit
for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
187.08 of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary

the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each

by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 187.092 of this Chapter
applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with any
provision in Section 187.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section 187.092
of this Chapter prevails.

taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
187.051(B) of this Chapter.

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
187.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
187.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
            The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

187.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of Plain
City's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the
15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which
the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 03-2024. Passed 1-22-24.)
187.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
187.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
187.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
187.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
187.096  REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
187.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
187.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.

11-25-19.)
187.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

include the person's social security number, federal employer identification

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
187.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
187.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
187.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
187.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
187.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
 
187.15 FRAUD.

187.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
187.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
 
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-19. Passed 11-25-19.)
187.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
187.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
187.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
187.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

189.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five (5) or more rooms are used for the
accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (b)   “Transient accommodation” means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered to guests in which four (4) or less rooms are used
for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty (30) consecutive days.
   (d)   “Vendor” means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel or
transient accommodation and who furnishes the lodging.
      (Ord. 3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village for use of the General Fund of the Village, there is hereby levied
an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or transient
accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests. The tax is three
percent (3%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the transient guest for the
lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is
furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply
to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political subdivisions, or any
charitable organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals, when
such charitable organization pays the hotel or transient accommodation for such
lodging.
   (b)   For the purposes of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent evasion of the tax it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels
or transient accommodations is subject to the tax until the contrary is
established. (Ord. 16-10. Passed 9-13-10.)
189.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies. (Ord.
3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.04 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection by an authorized representative of the
Village and shall be preserved for a period of four (4) years unless the
authorized representative, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.05 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall on or before the twentieth day of each month make
and file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Village
Fiscal Officer, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the Village for the period covered by the return and
such other information as the Village Fiscal Officer deems necessary for the
proper administration of this chapter. The Village Fiscal Officer may extend
the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by mailing the
same to the Village Fiscal Officer , together with payment of the amount of tax
shown to be due thereon.
   (b)   The Village Fiscal Officer may authorize vendors whose tax liability
is not such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Village Fiscal
Officer upon the basis of administrative costs to the Village, to make and file
returns at less frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and
shall indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)   The Village Fiscal Officer shall stamp or otherwise make on all
returns the date received by her and shall also show thereon by stamp or
otherwise the amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails
to file a return under this chapter shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit
and pay into the Village Treasury the sum of one dollar ($1.00).
   (d)   The Village Fiscal Officer, if she deems it necessary in order to
insure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and
payments to be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed
by the vendor or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 16-10. Passed 9-13-10.)
189.06 TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX- EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. (Ord. 3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.07 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.08 REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any vendor authorized by the Village Fiscal Officer to file returns at less
frequent intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the
Village Fiscal Officer may:
      (1)   Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by
the Village Fiscal Officer from a review of returns or other information
pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Village Fiscal Officer, conditioned upon
payment of the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be
filed within ten days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the
Village Fiscal Officer of its requirements.
      (2)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned
to the vendor, if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date
the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
         (Ord. 16-10. Passed 9-13-10.)
189.09 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the Village under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 2-13-95.)
189.10 INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;

owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense. (Ord. 12-83. Passed 8-8-83.)

      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
 331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

355.01  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   A parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of
issuing parking ticket citations. The provisions of this chapter and Chapter
351 , and all actions taken pursuant to this chapter and Chapter
351 , are civil and remedial in nature and not designed to punish the offender
and are not criminal offenses. No violation of this chapter or Chapter
351  shall be considered a misdemeanor of any class, and no person shall be
arrested for a violation of this chapter or Chapter
351  of the Codified Ordinances, the provisions of which are hereby declared to
be non-criminal civil parking infractions bearing the penalties set forth in
Section
351.99  and Section
355.07  and to be handled pursuant to Chapter 4521 of the Ohio Revised Code and
this chapter.
   (b)   Each parking citation issued shall contain the following information:
      (1)    The address and phone number of the Plain City Parking Violations
Bureau;
      (2)    The procedure to answer the charge as set forth in Section 
355.04 (a);
      (3)    The specific ordinance allegedly violated with a description of
the offense;
      (4)    Any penalty for not paying the ticket within the time prescribed;
and
      (5)    Any other information as required by Section 
355.02 (a).
         (Ord. 29-04. Passed 11-22-04.)
355.02 PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A parking enforcement officer or police officer who issues a parking
ticket for a parking infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the
parking infraction charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make
or model of the vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the
parking infraction charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the
facts it contains. If the operator of the vehicle is present, the officer also
shall record on the ticket the name of the operator in a space provided on the
ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall personally serve the
parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of the vehicle is not
present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the space provided on the
ticket and then shall constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of
the vehicle by affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by
affixation as provided in this division, or by the procedure described in
subsection (c) hereof, has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects
both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission results in
the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same penalties
for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the
parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the local authority and of the law enforcement agency whose officer
issued it, and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (c)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Ohio R.C. 4521.09.
   (d)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4521.09, when a parking ticket is
issued for a parking infraction and is served pursuant to this section, the
operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction for which the ticket was issued and the owner of the vehicle
involved in the parking infraction, if different, are jointly liable for the
parking infraction and any fine or penalty arising out of the parking
infraction under an ordinance, resolution, or regulation enacted by the local
authority pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.02. Any owner of a vehicle who pays any
fine or penalty imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this chapter may
recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction. (Ord. 29-04. Passed 11-22-04.)
355.03 PARKING TICKET VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)    The Plain City Parking Violations Bureau shall have jurisdiction over
each parking infraction that occurs within the territory of the Village,
including parking infractions that are violations of ordinances, resolutions,
or regulations of other local authorities and that occur within the territory
of the Village. All parking infractions that occur within the Village limits of
Plain City shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by this chapter and
Ohio R.C. Chapter 4521, when applicable.
   (b)   Personnel:
      (1)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer is hereby appointed Clerk of the Plain
City Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   The Council shall have the authority to appoint a hearing examiner
who shall hear challenges to parking tickets at hearings set by the Parking
Violations Bureau. At such hearing the rules of evidence need not be strictly
followed. No person shall be appointed as a hearing examiner unless the person
is an attorney admitted to the practice of law in this State or formerly was
employed as a law enforcement officer.
      (3)   The Council shall assign such other duties to Village personnel as
is necessary to properly operate the Plain City Parking Violations Bureau.
   (c)   All fines and penalties established for a parking infraction shall be
collected by the Clerk of the Plain City Parking Violations Bureau and paid
into the Village Treasury.
   (d)   The operating costs of the Plain City Parking Violations Bureau shall,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.05(A), be paid by the Village of Plain City.
(Ord. 29-04. Passed 11-22-04.)
355.04 ANSWER TO CHARGES.
   (a)   A person who is served with a parking ticket charging the commission
of a parking infraction may answer the charge by personal appearance at the
office of the Village Clerk-Treasurer during normal business hours or by mail.
The answer shall be made within ten days of the issuance of the parking ticket
(the mailing must be postmarked within ten days of the issuance of the ticket)
and shall be:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction by
payment of the fine.
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction.
      (3)   A denial that the infraction occurred and a request for a hearing.
If the person desires the presence of the parking enforcement officer or police
officer who issued the parking ticket, the person must request his presence in
his answer. A denial and request for appearance of the issuer must be written
on the back of the ticket when a denial is entered. Otherwise, the person need
only pay the fine to the Clerk.
   (b)   When a person denies that he has committed a parking violation, he
shall be granted a hearing which shall be civil in nature. The Plain City
Parking Violations Bureau shall set a date for the hearing and notify the
person, in writing, of the date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing
shall be conducted by the Hearing Examiner in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4521.08, which in its entirety, is incorporated herein by reference.
   (c)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction shall, and
a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with explanation
may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine to the Clerk of the Plain City
Parking Violations Bureau.
   (d)   A person who admits he committed a parking infraction with explanation
shall submit evidence to the Plain City Parking Violations Bureau that explains
the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may be
submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may be
sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Bureau upon
receiving an answer admitting that a person committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall promptly determine whether the explanation mitigates the fact
that the person committed the parking infraction and notify the person, in
writing, of its determination.
      (1)   If the Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates the fact
that the person committed the parking violation, it shall eliminate or reduce
the amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction. If the fine is
eliminated or reduced and the person has previously paid the fine, the amount
paid in excess of the revised fine shall be returned to the person. If the fine
is eliminated or reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine, the
person shall pay only the amount of the revised fine.  
      (2)   If the Bureau determines that the explanation does not mitigate the
fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the person owes the
entire amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction, and if the
person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay the entire amount
of the fine.
      (3)   If a person admits he committed a parking infraction with
explanation and the person fails to pay the amount of the fine due within ten
days after receiving notice of the Bureau's determination, unless the amount
due has previously been paid, the Bureau's determination and the amount of the
fine due shall be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a
judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to subsection (b)
hereof.
   (e)   If a person fails to timely answer a parking ticket citation, after
that person has been personally or constructively served with the citation
charging the offense, the Plain City Parking Violations Bureau shall issue a
notice of infraction and shall proceed pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.07. Failure
to answer a charge may result in the imposition of additional penalties set
forth in this chapter. (Ord. 29-04. Passed 11-22-04.)
355.05 FAILURE TO ANSWER; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   When a person is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction and the person fails to

355.04 for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a parking ticket.
   (d)   If a person who is issued a notification of infraction fails to timely
answer, as provided in subsection (c) hereof, the failure to answer shall be

be entered against the person. Failure to timely answer the parking infraction
identified in the notification of infraction may result in the imposition of
the additional penalties prescribed by the chapter.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

following circumstances:

or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC

      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of                                     Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to

533.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

905.01 AUTHORITY.
   Chapter
905 of these Codified Ordinances and the provisions of Section 729.01 of the
Ohio Revised Code, require property owners to be responsible for the
maintenance, repair, and if necessary, replacement of that portion of sidewalk
abutting their property line against any public street or alley in order that
publicly accessible sidewalks be maintained in a safe condition.
(Ord. 28-2024. Passed 12-9-24.)
905.02 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The construction, maintenance, and repair of sidewalks, curb ramps, and
shared-use paths are divided into specific responsibility:
   (a)    Existing Sidewalk. Existing sidewalks within publicly dedicated
right-of-way for public streets and alleys are the responsibility of the
abutting property owner for all required maintenance, repair and replacement
activities, and all associated costs thereof to maintain a safe access for
pedestrian movement.
   (b)   Existing Curb Ramps. Existing curb ramps constructed within publicly
dedicated right-of-way are the responsibility of the municipality to repair and
replace as required, including the inclined ramp, landing area, and transition
section of sidewalk. Such repairs shall be performed by the municipality.
   (c)   Existing Asphalt and Concrete Shared Use Paths (SUP). Property owners,
whose individual properties front an asphalt or concrete SUP. which is eight
foot or greater in width, that has been constructed as part of the designated
municipal trail and pathway network, are not responsible for repair and
replacement of the asphalt or concrete SUP unless damaged by activities on the
private property. The property owner shall not cut the SUP or bore under the
SUP without obtaining a permit and proper inspection.
   (d)   New Development. All new developments within the municipality shall
include the design and construction of sidewalks, curb ramps, and shared-use
paths that meet the current Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines
(PROWAG) and conform to municipal requirements. Sidewalks and ramps shall be
provided within the public right-of-way along both sides of all public streets,
and along private streets and parking areas per municipal specifications.
Shared-use paths shall be provided along all thoroughfare plan streets as
"frontage improvements" with all new development.
      (1)   Single-family residential development. Residential subdivisions
shall include the construction of all required curb ramps per plan as part of
the initial infrastructure construction, prior to the acceptance of the public
improvements by the municipality. The municipality will inspect and approve
forms for curb ramps prior to the placement of concrete; final inspection of
curb ramps shall occur after completion of construction on the adjacent corner
lot. The construction of sidewalk fronting residential lots may be deferred
until the construction of the associated residence on any lot; however, in no
circumstance shall the construction of the walk be deferred for a period
exceeding thirty (30) months from the date of acceptance of public improvements
for that development section. If a lot is left undeveloped for greater than
thirty (30) months after acceptance of the public improvements. the current
property owner shall build the sidewalk in front of each undeveloped lot to
ensure a connected sidewalk network. In such circumstances, if the sidewalk is
damaged by future construction activity on the lot, the sidewalk shall be
replaced upon completion of building on the lot.
      (2)    Multi-family residential development. Sidewalks and curb ramps
shown on approved plans may be constructed in phases in association with the
construction of specific buildings, and are to be completed, inspected, and
approved by the municipality prior to the occupancy of any adjacent building.
      (3)    Commercial and mixed-use developments. Sidewalks shown on approved
plans are to be constructed, inspected, and approved by the municipality prior
to the occupancy of any new facility associated with the development.
   (e)    Re-Development of Existing Property or Lots. Any property or lot in
which the existing building or structure is removed and replaced with a new
structure or expanded more than fifty percent (50%) of its existing size shall
include the design and construction of sidewalks and, if on a corner lot, curb
ramps that meet the requirements of subsection (d) hereof. The sidewalk shall
be situated horizontally and vertically in a manner to allow for connection to
adjacent lots, typically located one (1) foot inside the public right-of-way.
Any property or lot that is situated along a thoroughfare plan street shall
provide a shared-use path in lieu of a sidewalk unless otherwise approved by
the Village Engineer.
   (f)    Street Tree Damage. Sidewalk within existing public right-of-way or
public access easements that has been damaged by the root system of a street
tree existing within the street tree planting area between the sidewalks and
pavement edge shall be the responsibility of the municipality for necessary
repair and replacement. If the repair requires significant tree roots to be cut
away so that, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, the tree will not
survive and must be removed, the municipality shall have the tree removed and
replace the tree with a new tree of appropriate species.
   (g)    Enhanced Walkway Areas. Property owners, whose individual properties
abut an enhanced walkway that has been constructed by the municipality as part
of an area streetscape enhancement project, are not responsible for the repair
and replacement of the enhanced portion of the walkway. Enhanced walkways
include brick and paver sidewalks, ornamental tree gratings and castings, or
other hardscape elements that are located between the curb and the pedestrian
accessible route.
   (h)    Utility Boxes and Appurtenances. Private and public owners of utility
access structures including meter pits, utility valve boxes, communication pull
boxes, manholes, etc. that protrude more than one-half (½) inch above the
adjacent sidewalk surface are responsible for adjusting such appurtenance to be
flush with the sidewalk section and if necessary, replacement of the sidewalk
section.
   (i)    Routine Maintenance and Care. Property owners are responsible for the
routine maintenance and care of sidewalks, curb ramps, and shared-use paths at
all locations where the property is adjacent to the public right-of-way. This

designed and constructed in conformance with the current design and
construction specifications set forth by the municipality.

foot-wide minimum width may be used, subject to the approval of the Village
Engineer. Shared-use paths shall be a minimum width of eight (8) feet in the
public right-of-way and ten feet in open space or public easement. If sidewalks
or shared-use paths are located immediately adjacent to a curb, travel lane,

per square foot of sidewalk and per square foot of different types of driveways
as determined by the Village Administrator, plus a per linear- foot charge
based on the yearly coverage.
      (5)   The schedule of additional bond amounts shall state an amount
approximately equal to the cost of repair for the different types of streets,
sidewalks, curbs and gutters located within the Village based on the estimated
cost of repair per square yard at prevailing rates.
      (6)   Such bond and additional bond shall be held until the project is
completed and inspected by the Village Administrator or his designee. Should
completion of repair by the Village be necessary, the bond amounts shall be
used to defray the expense of such repair. The person, firm, corporation,
partnership, association or other entity making the opening or excavation shall
be liable for, and shall be billed for, any cost of such repair in excess of
the bond amount deposited. Conversely, such person, firm, corporation,
partnership, association or other entity shall be refunded any excess bond
amount when the actual cost of the Village making such repair is less than the
amount of bond which is on deposit.
   (d)   The Village Administrator is hereby required to promulgate rules for
street, sidewalk, driveway, curb and gutter openings, which rules are to be
reviewed on a yearly basis. Current costs for additional bond amounts, as
provided in subsection (c) of this section, are to be developed on an annual
basis and placed in effect at the beginning of each calendar year. They are to
be made available to the public along with the rules for openings and standards
of construction.
   (e)   The Village Administrator may waive bond for property owners who are
required by the Village to repair sidewalks, curbs and gutters or in cases
which he or she deems to be a matter of hardship.
   (f)   If the backfill of a repair to an opening or excavation settles after
completion of the repair to a point where the Village must make a supplemental
fill, the person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other entity
making an opening or excavation shall be liable for the actual cost of such
additional repair.
   (g)   Since digging into a street hastens its deterioration, a special
nonrefundable deterioration fee is required for all cuts in street surfaces.
Such fee shall be calculated in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Age of Pavement  Fee
0-3 years        $50.00 per sq. yd.
3-6 years        25.00 per sq. yd.
6-10 years       10.00 per sq. yd.
11 or more years 5.00 per sq. yd.
 
   (h)   If it is necessary, at any point in the making of a repair to an
opening or excavation, for the Village to use a concrete saw, a charge of three
dollars ($3.00) per lineal foot of cut will be assessed.
   (i)   The following shall apply to the issuance of street opening permits
for unsurfaced streets and alleys:
      (1)   A deposit equal to ten dollars ($10.00) per square yard of opening,
but not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each opening, is required.
      (2)   This deposit will be retained by the Village Fiscal Officer for a
period of three months after the permit is issued.
      (3)   The Village Administrator will collect these deposits when a street
opening permit is issued for an unsurfaced street or alley. Such deposit shall,
immediately upon receipt, be forwarded to the Fiscal Officer.
      (4)   At the end of three months the Village Administrator will notify
the Fiscal Officer of any charges against the deposit. Any balance remaining
after deducting actual expenses for repair will be refunded. If the charges are
in excess of the deposit, the person, firm, corporation, partnership,
association or other entity making the opening or excavation shall be liable
for any excess expense involved in the Village making the repair.
   (j)   Any person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other
entity intending to make an opening or excavation must provide the Village
Administrator at least a two-day prior notice of their intent to do the same,
and the repair of all openings or excavations must be finally inspected and
approved by the Village Administrator or his designee.
   The purpose of the street opening permit fee and additional fees is to allow
a determination of the type and size of the street, the amount of additional
bond necessary, the type of sidewalk and driveway that would be necessary, and
to cover the expense of any subsequent inspections of the area for which the
permit is obtained.
(Ord. 18-97. Passed 9-22-97.)

fulfilled with respect to the work or the object for which the permit was
obtained, the Village Fiscal Officer shall, upon written confirmation of the
same from the Village Administrator, issue a warrant to return the excess of
the cost to the person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other

   (a)   Findings and Purpose.
      (1)   The Village of Plain City, Ohio (the "Village") is vitally
concerned with the use of all Rights of Way in the Village as such Rights of
Way are a valuable and limited resource which must be utilized to promote the
public health, safety, and welfare including the economic development of the
Village.
      (2)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to Rights of Way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
      (3)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the Rights of Way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the Rights of Way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The Village has authority under the Laws and Constitution of the
State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4 and 7, to
regulate public and private entities which use the Rights of Way.
      (5)   In the interest of equity and uniformity specific utilities and
their uses are not singled out in this ordinance. The Village recognizes the
inherent differences between aerial and underground utilities and that some
rules and regulations may pertain to one and not the other. Where there is a
question of applicability, the ordinance shall be applied in the least
restrictive way for the occupant, providing the municipality's primary goal of
maintaining and managing the right of way is not negatively impacted.
   (b)   Scope. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all users of the
Rights of Way as provided herein. To the extent that anything in this Chapter
922 conflicts with Chapter 94 of the Ohio Basic Code or with any Village

general partner, limited partner or shareholder holding an interest of fifteen
percent (15%) or more, joint venturer or joint venture partner, of a Provider,

event mean any limited partner or shareholder holding an interest of less than
fifteen percent (15%) of such Provider, or any creditor of such Provider solely

occupy or use the Rights of Way to operate a System located in the Rights of
Way, or who has, or seeks to have, a System located in any Rights of Way, shall
apply for and obtain a Certificate of Registration pursuant to Chapter
922. Any Person owning, operating or maintaining a System in the Rights of Way
without a Certificate of Registration, including Persons operating under a
permit, license or franchise issued by the Village prior to the effective date
of Chapter
922 shall apply for and obtain a Certificate of Registration from the Village,
unless exempted by Section
922.02(d). Application will consist of providing the information set forth in
Section
922.03 and as reasonably required by the Mayor.
   (c)   No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the
effective date of Chapter
922, no Person shall Construct or perform any work on or in, or use any System
or any part thereof located on or in any Rights of Way without first obtaining
a Certificate of Registration. Whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth (4th) degree as provided for in Section

operating pursuant to a valid Cable Franchise, and Video Service Provider for

addition, Cable Operators shall be exempt from any requirement of the
Certificate of Registration process that is in direct conflict with the
requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a valid current and valid
Cable Franchise with the Village.
   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any System or
part of a System found in a Rights of Way for which a Certificate of
Registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the Rights of Way. The Village may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the Facilities and/or non complying portion of
such System; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing Providers and Permittees to place Facilities
in the Rights of Way, the Village shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any Provider's Facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the Rights of Way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Village. No
Provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this Chapter as creating a
special duty to any Provider.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any System in the Village shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the Village that the
Provider's obligations for its System in the Rights of Way under this section
and any other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another
Applicant and/or Provider; or
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner
that promotes the Village's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited Rights of Way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Village Engineer; or
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Village Engineer must approve said proposal; or
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
System in a manner acceptable to the Village within a reasonable amount of time
if the Village believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         E.   Submit to the Village within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its Facilities to the Village. If a Provider proceeds under this
clause, the Village may, at its option where lawful:
            (i)   Purchase the Facilities; or
            (ii)   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to Section
922.17(b), require the Provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Village for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the Facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a Provider who fail to comply with this Section and
which remain Unused Facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Village may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance;
         B.   Taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the Facilities by the Provider or by the
Provider's surety.
      (3)   If the Village requires a Provider to remove Unused Facilities in
any Rights of Way, the Village shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the Rights of
Way. If the Village abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,
those methods set forth in O.R.C. 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A Certificate of Registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the Rights of Way. A Certificate of Registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the Village,
for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the Certificate
of Registration and in accordance with Chapter
922 of the Code. The rights to occupy the Right of Way may not be subdivided or
subleased; provided, however, that two or more Providers may collocate
Facilities in the same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider
complies with the provisions of Chapter
922. Collocating Providers may file a joint application for a Construction
Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its
Facilities on Facilities of others, including the Village's Facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in
or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not
cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of Chapter
922. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying
with any provisions of the Code or other applicable Law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a Certificate
of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such Services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the Village's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents
to the Village. Further, a Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to
Chapter
922 shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with,
the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber,
cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the Village.
(Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)

Chapter, an Application must be filed with the Village on the form adopted by

agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Village as set forth above as
a condition of their use and occupancy of the Rights of Way, but Such
requirement to defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall not extend to the
negligence of the Village or its agents, elected officials, officers,
employees, volunteers and subcontractors, to the extent that the existence of
such negligence shall be proven to exist.
         (Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)
922.09 CIVIL FORFEITURES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this Chapter
922 and the remedy of specific performance, which may be enforced in a court of
competent jurisdiction, the Director of Public Works may assess an additional
penalty of civil forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of Chapter
922. Such penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the Village, in the
amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per twenty-four (24) hour day of
violation and any subsequent portion of a day less than twenty-four (24) hours
in length. Prior to assessing said penalty, the Village will provide written
notice to the Provider detailing the failure to comply with a specific
provision of Chapter
922. Such notice shall also indicate that said penalty shall be assessed in
fifteen (15) calendar days subsequent to the date of receipt if compliance is
not achieved. If a Provider desires to challenge such penalty, Provider must
request a public hearing before the Mayor within ten (10) days of service of
the notice. Such public hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the
Provider's request. If Provider requests such hearing before the Mayor, such
penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the public hearing,
the Mayor determines that Provider failed to comply with the specific provision
(s) of Chapter
922 referenced in the notice, such penalty shall be assessed starting with the
fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the notice referenced in this
section and continuing each day thereafter until compliance is achieved. The
determination of the Mayor shall be final. The Provider may file an
administrative appeal pursuant to O.R.C. Chapter 2506. The penalty shall
continue to accrue during the appeal unless the Provider obtains a stay and
posts a supersedeas bond pursuant to O.R.C. 2505.09 or the Provider comes into
full compliance with Chapter
922. Any prior failure to enforce a violation of any provision of Chapter
922 shall not constitute a waiver of the Village's right to enforce a Civil
Forfeiture under Section
922.09.

      (2)   The Village, on or about January 1st of each year, shall calculate
all the actual and incurred Construction Permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
Rights of Way that will result from Construction that takes place therein.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
Section means the accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way caused by
Construction in or disturbance of the Rights of Way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such Rights of Way earlier than would be required if the
Construction did not occur.
      (3)   The Village, on or about January 1st of each year, shall total all
the Construction Permit Fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled
fees required by the prior year's Construction Permit Fees for the previous
calendar year.
      (4)   The Village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in Section
922.13(d)(2) by the total Construction Permit Fees received as referenced in
Section
922.13(d)(3) to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous years
cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The Village shall multiply the then currently codified Construction
Permit Fees by the numerical factor as referenced in Section
922.13(d)(4) to calculate revised Permit Fees for the new calendar year .
      (6)   The Village shall act, on or about January 31st of each year, in
accordance with the results of Section
922.13(d)(5), to codify new annual Permit Fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous years Permit
Fees. Revised Permit Fees shall be effective upon passage. Any Permit requests
pending on the date of any annual Permit Fee modification shall be subject to
all new Permit Fees as modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in subsection Section
922.13(d)(8), no Construction Permit shall be issued without payment of
Construction Permit Fees except to the Village which shall be exempt.
Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the Village has
revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of Section
922.10 or Section
922.16(e) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Mayor may permit a Provider to make quarterly payments of
Construction Permit Fees based upon the Provider's financial condition and past
payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and payable within thirty
(30) days after the end of the quarter. The Mayor may revoke this permission
due to a change in financial condition, late payment, or other just cause.
   (e)   Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
Applications for Construction Permits to work in the Rights of Way at the same
place and time. Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
Construction Permit Fees.
(Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)
922.14 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights of Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Village) or another Permittee, a Permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Village Engineer. Where such
Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
Permittee located within the Rights of Way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the Village to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Village Engineer, a Permittee shall also record and
identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way
along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in Section
922.14(a)(1)A. - C., on the Construction Permittee's proposed System route maps
and Construction plans, along with the locations of the proposed facilities and
all other topographic and cadastral information.
         E.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
922.14(a)(1)D., Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Village Engineer, a Permittee shall not
excavate more than a Twelve (12) inch hole in the Rights of Way to complete
this task for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be immediately
repaired by the Permittee. A minimum of two (2) Working Days notice shall be
provided to the Village prior to performing these investigations.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to Village. Upon completion of the tasks described in Section
922.14(a), the Construction Permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled in
accordance with the requirements of Section
922.06(b), the proposed System route maps and Construction Plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the Provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Village. The mapping data is only required to be at the "Atlas" level of detail
necessary for the Village to reasonably determine the location of the
Provider's facilities in the Rights of Way. The Provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the Provider is not capable of being read by the
Village.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Village Engineer the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
922.14(a) - (c).
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in Chapter
922 or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Village Engineer waives any
of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a
Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction schedule to the
Village not less than five (5) Working Days before commencing any work in or
about the Rights of Way, and shall further notify the Village not less than two
(2) Working Days in advance of any excavation in the Rights of Way. This
Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under
Section
922.16(d)(1) (Emergency Situations) and Section
922.15 (Minor Maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws and the Village's Rules and Regulations. Detailed plans and
applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Village for review and
approval prior to construction of any Facilities except those that are
categorized as "Minor Maintenance" issues as per Section
922.15 herein.
      (2)   The Village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right of Way is
Full. In making such decisions, the Village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year with respect to essential
Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future
Village and County plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface Rights of Way pursuant to Chapter
922 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable,
wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to Chapter
922 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions. The Village may grant a special exception to the
requirements of Section
922.14(f) and Section
922.14(g) if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
         A.   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
           B.   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and
the potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the Village.
         C.   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
         D.   The requirements requested by the Village herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Village.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way
whenever the Village finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation.
In instances where the Village requests removal and/or relocation, the Village
shall waive all applicable Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or
relocation, the Provider shall restore the Rights of Way to the same or better
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are
required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be
replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with Law, the
Village may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Village.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right of Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Rights of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Village, a Provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated by the
Village, within thirty (30) days after the Village's removal order, or if a
Provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated
repair of the Rights of Way of the Village, within twelve (12) months
thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law, the
Village shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the Village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the Village at Provider's cost and
expense, by another Person; however, the Village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the
Village for all reasonable costs incurred by the Village in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the Village
designated by the Village for removal and not timely removed by the Provider
shall belong to and become the property of the Village without payment to the
Provider, and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
Village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the Village, to
evidence such ownership by the Village.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any Rights of Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its Facilities.
      (2)   All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights of Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of Rights of Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
Engineer, and complete the restoration of the Rights of Way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Village.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the Village
may choose either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or
alternatively to restore the Rights of Way itself if the Permittee has in the
past not abided by requirements of Chapter
922.
      (3)   If the Village allows a Permittee to restore the Rights of Way, the
Permittee may at the time of Application for a Construction Permit be required
to post a Construction Bond in an amount submitted by the Permittee with a
detailed cost breakdown to the Village Engineer for approval that is sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
Restoration of the Rights of Way, the Village determines that the Rights of Way
have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond shall be
released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the Village. The Village shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
Village in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the Rights of Way; the traffic volume carried by the
Rights of Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the Rights of Way;
the pre-excavation condition of the Rights of Way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the Rights of Way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights of Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights of Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the Rights of Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Rights of Way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Mayor, correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary using the method
required by the Village Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Mayor, unless otherwise extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Village, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the Village, the Village, at its
option, may do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the
Village, within thirty (30) days of billing, the Restoration cost of restoring
the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the Village. Upon failure to
pay, the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee
and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Village and/ or another
Permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the Restoration
responsibility among the Village, Providers and/or other Persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities. 
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the Village
performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
Law, to maintain, support, or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those
Facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and
shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to
pay, the Village may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a
Provider does not pay or the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit
posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
Facilities of another Provider caused during the Village's response to an
Emergency occasioned by that Provider's Facilities.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Village-owned Facilities in the Rights of Way which the Provider or its
Facilities damage.
   
   (m)   Rights of Way Vacation.
      (1)   If the Village sells or otherwise transfers a Rights of Way which
contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer shall be subject
to any existing easements of record and any easements required pursuant to
O.R.C. 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Village Engineer.
   (o)   Inspection. When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Village.
      (1)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or Chapter
922.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
which does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as
provided in Section
922.19(b). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Works. The
decision of the Director of Public Works may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Works
that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented
within the required time, the Mayor may revoke the Permit pursuant to Section
922.16(e).
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other Laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all Laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
Laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the Rights of Way
pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No Rights of Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
922.16(d)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a Rights of Way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Village Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by Chapter
922, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the Village, always use Best Efforts to place
Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right of Way
shall be installed in conduit. (Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)
 922.15 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (a)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement.  
No Person shall perform Minor Maintenance of Facilities in the Rights of Way
without first having obtained a Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit as set

pursuant to Section
922.06(e) that clarify the definition of Minor Maintenance and/or provide a
process for a Provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
Minor Maintenance.
      (1)   A Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit allows the Right of Way
Minor Maintenance Permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
Rights of Way as required.
      (2)   A Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   A Right of Way Minor Maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (4)   A Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a Permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a
Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit shall be made to the Director of Public
Works. In addition to any information required by the Village, all Right of Way

   (c)   Issuance of Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permits; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Works determines that the Applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this Chapter and the Right of Way Minor
Maintenance Permit process, the Director of Public Works shall issue a Right of
Way Minor Maintenance Permit subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   The Village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the
Rules and Regulations enacted by the Village Engineer, upon the issuance of the
Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit and the performance of the Right of Way
Minor Maintenance Permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the Rights of Way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the Rights of Way, and to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Village shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit but
may revoke the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit as any other Permit may be
revoked under this Chapter.
(Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)
922.16 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application; or
      (2)   To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the Village unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the Village
Fiscal Officer and the Village Solicitor; or
      (3)   To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a Permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Village Administrator, the issuance of
a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Village Administrator, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of Way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Village Administrator may deny a
Permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights
of Way, or when necessary to protect the Rights of Way and its users.
      (1)   The Village Administrator, in his/her discretion, may consider one
or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which Rights of Way space where the Permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the Rights of
Way; and/or
         C.   The availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in
other Rights of Way for the proposed Facilities; and/or
         D.   The applicability of Chapter
922 or other regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of
Facilities in the Rights of Way; and/or
         E.   The degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of its Certificate of Registration, Chapter
922, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights of Way;
and/or
         G.   The condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Rights of Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Rights of Way; and/or
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of Chapter
922 or, if applicable, any other Law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twenty-four (24) months after construction completion
or a newly reconstructed street within twenty-four (24) months of
reconstruction completion, except where:
         A.   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Village Engineer determines it is in the best interests of
the Village that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.  
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
922.16(a)(1) and Section
922.16(a)(2), the Village Administrator may issue a Permit in any case where
the Permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by Credible evidence satisfactory to the
Village; or
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its Service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a Permit under this Section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Public Works of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Village Engineer, after the occurrence
or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider shall apply
for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the
rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with Chapter
922 for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency. In the event
that the Village becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Provider's
Facilities, the Village shall use Best Efforts to contact the Provider or the
System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected, by
the Emergency. In any event, the Village may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a Rights of Way without a valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the normal fee for said
Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
Village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights of Way and
comply with all of the requirements of Chapter
922.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Village reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any Law, or any provision or condition of
the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Village or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit; or
         D.   The failure to maintain the required Construction or Removal
Bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to
Section
922.14(o)(3).
      (2)   If the Village Administrator determines that the Permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
condition of the Permit, the Village Administrator shall serve a written demand
upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Village Administrator may place
additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Village Administrator
with a plan, acceptable to the Village Administrator, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Village Administrator, or the Permittee's
failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the
Permit.
      (4)   If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year,
except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the
Village for the Village's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
such revocation. (Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-18.)
922.17 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any Construction, a
Construction Permittee, excluding the Village and the County, shall deposit
with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety
bond in an amount determined by the Village Solicitor to be appropriate based
upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a Construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the Village shall serve written notice to the Construction Permittee detailing
the Construction default, problem or deficiency. If the Village determines that
correction or repair of the Construction default, problem or deficiency has not
occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days
after the date following service and notification and detailing the
Construction default, problem or deficiency, then the Village may attach the
letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be
served on the Construction Permittee by the Village.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration and
continuously thereafter, and until one hundred twenty (120) days after a
Provider's Facilities have been removed from the Rights of Way, (unless the
Village notifies the Provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a
Provider shall deposit with the Village and maintain an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal to or greater
than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), the Village shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow Provider a period of five (5) calendar days after
serving notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to the Village attachment of the letter of credit or surety
bond regarding the removal of Facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall
be provided to the Provider by the Village.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.
      (1)   In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
922.17(a) and the Removal Bond required by Section
922.17(b), Provider may deposit with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million dollars
($5,000,000.00). Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency involves
an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Village shall
make all reasonable effort to allow Permittee a period of five (5) calendar
days after sending notification in writing to correct or repair any default,
problem or deficiency prior to Village's attachment of the letter of credit or
surety bond.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
922.17(a), the Removal Bond required by Section
922.17(b) and the Blanket Bond required by Section
922.17(c), those Providers maintaining a book value in excess of fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000.00) may submit a statement to the Village requesting to
self-bond. If approval to self bond is granted, a Provider shall assure the
Village that such self-bonding shall provide the Village with no less
protection and security than would have been afforded to the Village by a third
party surety providing Provider with the types and amounts of bonds detailed in
the above named Sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the Applicant's self bonding program.
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Village.
   (e)   Purposes.
      (1)   The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to the
extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
         A.   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all
terms, conditions and obligations of Chapter
922; and
         B.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village
occasioned by the Permittee or Provider's violation of Chapter
922 or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and
other directives of the Village issued pursuant to Chapter
922; and
         C.   The payment of all compensation due to the Village, including
Permit Fees; and
         D.   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to Chapter
922; and
      E.   The removal of Facilities from the Rights of Way pursuant to Chapter
922; and
         F.   The payment to the Village of any amounts for which the Permittee
or Provider is liable that are not paid by it's insurance or other surety; and
         G.   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the Village
pursuant to Chapter
922 or the Law.
   (f)   Form. The bond documents required by this Section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to Village of
surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond. (Ord. 8-18. Passed 7-9-
18.)
922.18 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   Village Does Not Accept Liability.
      (1)   By reason of the acceptance of an Application, the grant of a
Permit or the issuance of a Certificate of Registration, the Village does not
assume any liability:
         A.   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service
claims; or
         B.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of Facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.
      (1)   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with
the Village a Provider is required, or by accepting a Permit a Permittee is
required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Village's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
Construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a Rights of Way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a Permit. Such requirement to defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall not
extend to the negligence of the Village or its agents, elected officials,
officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors, to the extent that the
existence of such negligence shall be proven to exist. A Provider or Permittee
shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding
claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the Village's agents,
elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and subcontractors for any
claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance
or operation of its Facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a Rights
of Way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by a Permit. This Section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the Provider, Permittee or to
the Village; and the Provider or Permittee, in defending any action on behalf
of the Village, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the Village could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise
of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Village, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the Village
or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees,
costs and expenses assumed by the Village in connection therewith); and
            (i)   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the

   The Sanitary Sewer System of the Village consists of trunks, interceptors,
and collection sewers laid in streets, alleys, rights of way, and easements,
and a wastewater treatment plant, the locations of which are shown upon plans
and drawings filed in the Office of the Village Administrator, and all other
appurtenances which are used in whole or in part in connection with the
collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater and industrial wastes; and
all other extensions, additions and improvements which may be made to such a
system. Its purpose is to provide for the collection and treatment of domestic
wastewater and such industrial wastes as are permitted by this chapter, in
order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
Village in conformity with all applicable State and Federal laws relating
thereto. The objectives are:

925.03 BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    Control of Sewer System. The sewer system of the Village, as
constructed, or as hereafter added to or changed, shall be under the charge and
control of the Village Administrator under whose supervision the sewer system
shall be used by property owners. No person shall enter into, open, or
interfere with or use or do any repair or maintenance work with respect to the
sewer system except under the inspection and direction of the Superintendent,
and after a written permit has been issued on payment of a fee established by
Council from time to time.
   (b)    Connection Fees. The Council shall adopt ordinances, rules and
regulations to govern the construction and maintenance of the sewer system and
shall therein fix the amount of fees that shall be chargeable to persons or
property owners who may wish to enter or use the sewer system, which fee shall
be sufficient in amount to pay for the cost of installation of such entry or
entries listed in the latest sewer tap fees and sewer capacity fees ordinances.
   The owner or his agent shall make application to the Public Utilities Clerk
for services. All plans and specifications shall be submitted to the Zoning
Inspector and must follow the outline listed in the Subdivision Regulations for
review by the Administrator and the Village Engineer and approved by Council.
   (c)    Permit Limitations. Permits granted under this chapter shall be for a
specific wastewater, and such permits shall be granted only after the
submission and approval of plans as set forth hereinafter. Subsequent
wastewaters of different quantity, quality, or characteristics shall be covered
by separate permits.
   (d)    Protection of Sanitary and Building Sewers During Construction. No
person constructing a sanitary sewer, building, or house connection shall leave
the same open, unsealed or incomplete in such fashion as to permit storm,
surface or subsurface water to enter such sewers.
   (e)    Cost of Building Sewer. All costs and expenses incidental to the
installation and connection of the Building Sewer shall be borne by the owner.
The owner shall indemnify the Village from any cost or damage that may directly
or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the Building Sewer.
   (f)    Building Sewer Limitations. Every building which is the source of the
heretofore described acceptable wastewater shall be provided with a separate
and independent Building Sewer.
   (g)   Combined Sewers. The construction of or extension to combined sewers
is hereby prohibited unless approved by OEPA.
   (h)    Private Sanitary Sewers. Private (as opposed to "Public") sanitary
sewers shall continue to be owned by the owners now owning the same until such
time as the owner and Council mutually agree to a transfer of ownership to the
Village. Such sewers shall be controlled by the Village but shall be operated
and maintained by their owners, unless the Village agrees in writing to provide
this service in which case a proper easement shall be dedicated to the Village.
   (i)   Permit Refusal. The Village may refuse to issue a Permit for a new
connection to the sanitary sewer system unless there is available capacity in
all down stream facilities, including treatment plant capacity for BOD5.
(Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.04 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)    Prohibition of Unpolluted Water. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged, either directly or indirectly, any storm water, surface
water, ground water, roof run- off, subsurface drainage, cooling water, or
unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
      (1)    Any such connections made either before or after the effective
date of this chapter shall be considered illegal and shall be subject to
immediate removal by the owner of the premises so connected and at such owner's
expense.
      (2)    Sub-foundation building drains connected to sanitary sewers before
the effective date of this chapter will not be required to be removed unless it
is established by the Village that such connection is detrimental to the
satisfactory operation of the sewage works and that such removal is cost-
effective. Any such connections made after the effective date of this chapter
shall be prohibited and shall be considered illegal.
      (3)    Should the owner of such an illegally connected premises fail to
remove the connection within ninety (90) days after official notice to do so,
the Village shall cause the connection to be removed and the cost thereof shall
be billed to the owner of the premises.
   (b)    Illegal Discharges to Natural Outlet or Storm Sewer. No person shall
discharge, or cause to be discharged, to any natural outlet or storm sewer any
sanitary, industrial, or other polluted wastewater.
   (c)    Allowable Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage, such as from air conditioning, swimming pools, etc. shall
be discharged into such sewers as are specifically designed and designated as
storm sewers or to a natural outlet approved by the Administrator. Industrial
cooling water or unpolluted wastewater may be discharged, on approval of the
Village Engineer, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. If such waters are
polluted with insoluble oils or grease or suspended solids, they shall be
treated for removal of the pollutants, and the clear water discharged as
specified.
   (d)    Trucked or Hauled Wastes. No person shall access the sewer system or
WWTP for any activity including discharge of hauled septic or industrial
wastes. Any removal of manhole lids, or other access to the sewer system for
the purpose of discharging wastes, shall be considered a violation and shall be
subject to enforcement action including fines and penalties allowed under this
chapter.
   (e)    General Discharge Prohibition. 
      (1)    As to any waters or wastes which are discharged, or are proposed
to be discharged, which contain compatible or incompatible pollutants other
than sanitary sewage and which may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, including violation of
applicable water quality standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life
or constitute a public nuisance, the Village shall:
         A.   Reject the discharge of such waters or wastes;
         B.   Require pretreatment of quantities and establish rates of
discharge to the public sewers; and/or
         C.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling, treating and
disposing of the wastes.

cooling water, which is used to dilute process wastewater, or in any other way
attempts to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement (40
CFR 403.6 (d)), except such water may be discharged to a sewer which is
designated to carry storm water.
   (f)    Limitations on Wastewater Strength. The National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, as promulgated by the USEPA pursuant to the Act, which
are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by the reference shall be met by all
users of regulated industrial categories. (A Copy of Standards shall be
available at the Village.) The only exception to this requirement is when the
Village, upon application for removal credits, receives a modification to the
Categorical Pretreatment Standards as provided for under the Act.
      (1)    State requirements and limitations on discharges to the Sewage
Works shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any
instance in which they are more stringent than Federal requirements and
limitations or those in this or any other applicable ordinance.
      (2)    The Village reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide
for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the Sewage
Works where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in Section
925.01 .
      (3)    No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any
way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with the standards set forth in this chapter.
      (4)    No user shall discharge wastewater containing concentrations of
the following enumerated materials, exceeding the following values:

      (5)    The Village may impose mass limitations on dischargers where the
imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate by the Village
Administrator and/or Village Engineer.
   (g)   Removal Credits. Where applicable, the Village may elect to initiate a
program of removal credits as part of this chapter to reflect the wastewater
treatment plants' ability to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR Part
403.7.
   (h)    Grease and Oil Interceptors. For grease, oil, and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Administrator, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
subsection (e)(2)M. hereof, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located so as to
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors the owner shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Administrator. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials
not performed by the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
   (i)    Pretreatment Facilities. Industrial Dischargers shall provide
necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and
shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
within the time limitations as specified by this chapter and the Federal
Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a
level acceptable to the Village shall be provided, operated and maintained at
the Discharger's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Village for review, and such
plans and operating procedures shall be acceptable to the Village before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the Discharger from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Village under
provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to, and be acceptable to,
the Village prior to the Discharger's initiation of the changes.
(Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.05 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES, BYPASSES AND SPILLS.
   (a)    Accidental Discharges. Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances
established by this chapter. If required by the Village, the user shall
prepare, submit and maintain a Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure
Plan. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the User’s cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Village for review, and shall be approved
by the Village Engineer before construction of the facility. Each existing user
shall complete its plan and submit the same to the Village within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of this chapter. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from responsibility to
modify its facility as necessary to meet requirements of this chapter.
      (1)    Users shall notify the Administrator immediately upon accidentally
discharging wastes in violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures to be
taken to minimize damage to the sewage works, treatment processes and the
receiving water. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective action. A
written notification containing the same information shall follow within three
(3) working days. This notification shall be followed, within fifteen (15) days
of the date of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent
future occurrences. Such notification will not relieve users of liability for
any fines provided for in Section
925.09 , or for any expense, loss or damage to the sewage works, or treatment
process, or for any fines imposed on the Village on account thereof.
      (2)    In order that employees of users be informed of these
requirements, users shall make available to their employees copies of this
chapter, together with such other wastewater information and notices as may be
furnished by the Village from time to time, and directed towards more effective
water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on
the user's bulletin board advising employees whom to call in case of an
accidental discharge in violation of this chapter.
      (3)    Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or
deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system shall be
eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable, the user shall
appropriately label entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes in
violation of this chapter.
   (b)    Bypass. A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. If the user knows in
advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
Administrator, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass. A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable Pretreatment Standards to sewage works immediately upon becoming
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five
(5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent re-occurrence of the bypass.
Bypass is prohibited, and the Village may take enforcement action against an
industrial user for a bypass unless:
      (1)    Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
      (2)    There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)    The industrial user submitted notices as required by 40 CFR
403.17.
   (c)   Operating Upsets. Any user which experiences an upset in operations
which places the user in a temporary state of non-compliance with this chapter
shall inform the Administrator thereof within twenty-four (24) hours of first
awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given
orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the user with the
Wastewater Superintendent within five (5) days. The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a user's compliance status;
      (2)    Duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)    All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other condition of non-compliance.
   A documented and verified bona fide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Village against a user for any
non-compliance with this chapter which arises out of violations alleged to have
occurred during the period of upset. The user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the responsibility to provide adequate proof
of upset. (Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.06 INDUSTRIAL PERMITS.
   (a)    Industrial Waste Discharge Permit and Pretreatment. No person shall
discharge industrial waste, either directly or indirectly, into the Village
Sewage Works without first obtaining approval and/or a written permit from the
Village. Such approval and/or written permit shall be granted after the
Administrator has ascertained that the discharge of waste in the particular
instance is not in violation of this chapter and the discharge shall receive
satisfactory pretreatment as may be required by this chapter. Industries
classified as significant industrial users and others as deemed necessary by
the Administrator shall obtain the written permit. Obtaining an approval and/or
a discharge permit does not relieve the industry from its obligation to obtain
other permits required by Federal, State or local law. Upon due notification
and for just cause, the Village has the right to revoke or suspend any permit
issued in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)    Wastewater Discharge Permit Disclosure. All industrial users
proposing to connect to, or to discharge sewage, industrial wastes and other
wastes to, the sewage works shall complete and file with the Village, a permit
application in the form prescribed by the Village. Existing industrial users
shall file the necessary forms within thirty (30) days after receiving an
official request by the Administrator to do so, and a proposed new user shall
file its forms at least ninety (90) days prior to connecting to the sewage
works. No discharge permit shall be issued unless and until the user has
submitted the following required information:
      (1)    Disclosure of name, address, and location of the user;
      (2)    Disclosure of user's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)
number according to the Standard Classification Manual, Bureau of the Budget,
1972, as Amended;
      (3)    Disclosure of user's wastewater constituents and characteristics
including but not limited to those mentioned in this chapter, as determined by
bona fide chemical and biological analysis. Sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the USEPA and contained
in 40 CFR, Part 136, as amended;
      (4)    Disclosure of time and duration of user's discharges;
      (5)    Disclosure of user's average daily and instantaneous peak
wastewater flow rates, in gallons per day, including daily, monthly and

verifiable techniques are approved by the Village due to cost or non-
feasibility;
      (6)    Disclosure of the user's site plans, floor plans, mechanical and
plumbing plans and details to show all sewers, sewer connections, inspection
manholes, sampling chambers and appurtenances by size, location and elevation;
      (7)    Description of user's activities, facilities and plant processes
on the premises including all materials which are or may be discharged to the
Village’s sewage works;
      (8)    Disclosure of the nature and concentration of any pollutants or
materials prohibited by this chapter in the user's discharge, together with a
statement regarding whether or not compliance is being achieved with this
chapter on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance activities and/or additional pretreatment is required for the user
to comply with this chapter;
      (9)    Where additional pretreatment and/or operations and maintenance
activities will be required to comply with this chapter, the user shall provide
a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional operational and
maintenance activities according to Section
925.07 (c);
      (10)    Disclosure of each product produced by the user by type, amount,
process or processes, and rate of production;
      (11)    Disclosure of the type and amount of raw materials utilized by
the user (average and maximum per day);
      (12)    All disclosure forms shall be signed by a principal executive of
the user and a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the State of Ohio;
      (13)    For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate shall be
included. For all other industrial users subject to categorical regulations in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production the report shall
include the users' actual production during the period sampled as per 40 CFR
403.12(d);
      (14)    Permit applications shall include a certification statement as
required in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and amendments thereto.
   The Administrator will evaluate the complete application and data furnished
by the user. Within thirty (30) days, and after full evaluation, the Village
will: notify the user of acceptance and if deemed necessary, issue a Wastewater
Discharge Permit subject to terms and conditions provided for herein; or reject
the application and state the basis therefor.
   (c)    Permit Conditions. Wastewater Discharge Permits shall specify no less
than the following:
      (1)    Fees and charges to be paid upon initial permit issuance;
      (2)    Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics regulated thereby;
      (3)    Limits on average and maximum rate and time discharge and/or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization;
      (4)    Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities;
      (5)    Special conditions, as the Village may reasonably require under
particular circumstances, of a given discharge including sampling locations,

      (7)    Requirements for submission of special technical reports or
discharge reports where the same differ from those prescribed by this chapter.
   (d)    Permit Duration. All Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued for a
specified time period not to exceed five (5) years.
   (e)    Permit Continuation. An expired permit will continue to be effective
and enforceable until the permit is reissued if:
      (1)    The user has submitted a completed permit application at least
ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the user's current permit; and
      (2)    The failure to reissue the permit prior to its expiration is not
due to any act or failure to act on the part of the user.
   (f)    Permit Modification. The Village reserves the right to amend any
Wastewater Discharge Permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Any request for modification filed by the user
does not stay the existing permit. Within nine (9) months of the promulgation
of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the Wastewater Discharge
Permit of each user subject to such standards shall be revised to require
compliance with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such
standards. All National Categorical Pretreatment Standards adopted after the
promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the Village as part of this
chapter. Where a user, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard,
has not previously submitted an application for a Wastewater Discharge Permit
per subsection (a) hereof, the user shall apply for a Wastewater Discharge
permit from the Village within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
promulgation of the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard by
the USEPA. In addition, the user with an existing Wastewater Discharge Permit
shall submit to the Village within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the
information required by subsections (b)(8) and (9) hereof. The user shall be
informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. In addition the
Village will forward pertinent information regarding changes in the National
Pretreatment Categorical Standards to industries affected if the information
received by the Village from the EPA does not indicate that the industry has
already been informed by the EPA.
   (g)   Permit Appeals. The Administrator will provide all interested persons
with notice of final permit decisions. Upon notice by the Administrator, any
person, including the industrial user, may petition to appeal the terms of the
permit within thirty (30) days of the notice. All such appeals are subject to
the following conditions:
      (1)    Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to
be a waiver of the appeal;
      (2)    In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the permit
provisions objected to, the reason for this objection, and the alternative
condition, if any, it seeks to be placed in the permit;
      (3)    The permit shall be in effect and shall not be stayed pending a

or transferred to any other location, without the prior written approval of the
Administrator.
(Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.07 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   (a)   Reporting Requirements for Industrial User. Any user subject to a
Pretreatment Standard set forth in this chapter shall submit to the Village
within ninety (90) days following the final compliance date of such
Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a new user, within ninety (90) days
after commencement of the discharge to the Village's sewage works, and
thereafter during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by the Village, a report indicating the nature and concentration of
prohibited or regulated substances in its discharge which are limited by the
Pretreatment Standards hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record
of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows during the
reporting period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement,
provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Village
may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable
techniques. The Administrator, for good cause shown and considering such
factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other
extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of such reports on months
other than those specified above.
      (1)    Reports of users shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the Village. The frequency of
monitoring by the user shall be as prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment
Standard of this chapter. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with 40
CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a
sampling and analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
EPA publication, “Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants” April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the USEPA. Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the user responsible for the discharge, or his
qualified agent as approved by the Administrator. The results of the analysis
shall be reported to the Village on a periodic basis on forms provided for by
the Village. The Village shall make its own analysis on the wastes, and this
determination shall be binding as a basis for charges, except as follows:
          A.   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village
result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the
industry to collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own
samples. The results of the analyses of the samples collected by the Village
and the industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures and the
differences negotiated.
      (2)    Reports shall state whether applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
facilities and/or pretreatment is necessary to gain compliance with applicable
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.
      (3)    If an industrial user's sampling data indicates a violation, the
industrial user shall notify the Administrator within twenty-four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the violations as per 40 CFR 403.12(g)(2) and amendments
thereto. The user shall re-sample and submit to the Administrator the results
of the re-sampling within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the initial
violation. Any violation of this chapter revealed by the industrial user's
sampling shall be considered to continue until a subsequent sampling shows the
results to be in compliance.
      (4)    Required reports shall be based on data outlined during the period
covered by the report and on an amount of sampling appropriate for that
industrial user as per 40 CFR 403.12(g)(3) and amendments thereto.
       (5)    Results of additional monitoring, at Village designated
monitoring sites beyond the minimum required, shall be included in the reports
required during the same period as per 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) and amendments
thereto.
   (b)    Wastewater Volume Determinations. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste charges shall be the metered water consumption of
the person as shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by the
Village, except as herein provided in this section.
      (1)   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the Village
water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the
person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type
approved by the Administrator for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from those other sources.
       (2)    The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his own expense metering devices for determining
the volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial waste charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a
type acceptable to the Village.
       (3)    The Village may require the installation of devices for the
measuring of the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (4)    Any metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged
to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person.
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the
consent of the Administrator.
 
   (c)    Compliance Schedule. The schedule shall contain milestone dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to comply with the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to, dates relating to
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, and all other acts to achieve compliance with this chapter. Under
no circumstances shall the Village permit a time increment for any single step
directed toward compliance which exceeds nine (9) months. Not later than
fourteen (14) days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final
date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
Administrator. This report shall include no less than a statement as to whether
or not the user has complied with the increments of progress represented by
that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with
this increment of progress, or the reason for delay, and the steps being taken
by the user to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event
shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the
Village.
   (d)    Signatory Requirements. All reports under this section shall include
a certification statement as required in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and amendments
thereto. Additionally all reports are to be signed by:
      (1)    A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice president of a
corporation;
      (2)    A general partner or proprietor if the industrial user is a
partnership or sole proprietorship respectively; or
      (3)    A duly authorized representative of the above if the authorization
is previously made in writing to the Administrator.
   (e)    Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the
Village with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Village that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or
secret processes or proprietary information of the user. When requested by a
user furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System permit and/or the
Pretreatment Programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall
be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review or
enforcement involving the user furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
Information accepted by the Village as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any governmental agency or to the general public by the Village until and
unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user.
   (f)    Changes in the Wastewater. All industrial users shall promptly notify
the Administrator at least two (2) weeks in advance of any substantial changes
in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user is
required to submit notification under 40 CFR 403.12(e). For the purpose of this
section, substantial change shall mean a change in either discharge flows or
mass of pollutants of more than twenty (20) percent above or below daily
average flow or mass.
   (g)   Monitoring Facilities. The Village may require any industrial user to
provide and operate at the user's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the
Village sewage works. All monitoring and sampling facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction
standards and specifications. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the
user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user. The Village may permit the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility
is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, and such
sampling and measuring equipment as may be required, shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Plans and specifications for proposed monitoring facilities shall be submitted
for approval to the Village within sixty (60) days of receipt of request for
installation by the user. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90)
days of receipt of permit by the user.
   (h)    Inspection and Sampling. 
      (1)    The Village may inspect the facilities of any user to determine
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The user shall allow the duly
authorized employee(s) of the Village bearing proper identification to enter
upon the premises of the user at all reasonable hours, without delay, for the
purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, or records
examination. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The duly authorized employee
(s) of the Village shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations, and to make copies of such records as deemed
necessary. The powers and authority herein granted shall be in addition to
powers of inspection otherwise granted by law to the Village.
      (2)    All information in the possession of the owner bearing on the
industrial, commercial, or other processes which, in the judgment of the
Administrator, affect the sewage works or system, shall be made available to
the Administrator or his authorized representative.
   (i)    Record Retention. All users subject to this chapter shall retain and
preserve for no less than three (3) years, any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries thereof, relating
to monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis made by or on behalf of a user in
connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment, or any other enforcement or
litigation activities brought by the Village pursuant hereto, shall be retained
and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and
all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.08 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Notification of Violation, Administrative Adjustment. 
      (1)   Whenever the Village finds that any user has violated, or is
violating provisions of this chapter or engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of a wastewater treatment service, pursuant to subsection (c)
hereof, the Administrator may serve or cause to be served upon such user, a
written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.
       (2)    Within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the notice the
user shall respond personally or in writing to the Village Administrator,
advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter the
parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (b)    Orders. The Administrator may issue orders to any user as deemed
necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. No user
shall violate any order issued to that user. Orders shall be served upon the
affected user directly or by certified mail. Any user issued an order by the
Village may appeal that order according to subsection (e) hereof. The
Administrator may issue, but is not limited to the following type of orders:
      (1)    Consent orders. The Administrator may enter into consent orders
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such
orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
non-compliance within a specified time period.
      (2)    Compliance orders. When the Village finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate this chapter, the Administrator may issue an
order to that user, directing the user that, following a specified time period,
sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities have
been installed and properly operated. The orders may also contain other
requirements as deemed necessary and appropriate to address the non-
compliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring, and management practices.
      (3)    Cease and desist orders. When the Village finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate this chapter, the Administrator may issue an
order to cease and desist such violations and direct those users in non-
compliance to: comply forthwith; and/or take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
   (c)    Revocation of Treatment Services. The Village may seek to suspend or
terminate the water and/or wastewater treatment services, and where applicable,
revoke the discharge permit of any user which fails to:
      (1)   Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of
its discharge;
      (2)    Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)    Permit reasonable access to the user's premises by a
representative of the Village for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)    Observe and comply with the conditions of this chapter, their
permit, or any final judicial order entered with respect thereto.
   Reissuance of a discharge permit shall be at the discretion of the
Administrator, and may be subject to such conditions as deemed appropriate.
   (d)    Show Cause Hearing. Where the violation of a subsection hereof is not
corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the
Village may order any user which causes or allows conduct prohibited by
subsection (c) hereof, to show cause before the Administrator or his duly
authorized representatives, why the proposed service enforcement action should
not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the user either personally or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time
and place of a hearing to be held by the Administrator, or his designee,
regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken,
the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before
the Administrator why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of hearing shall be served no less than ten (10) days before the
hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized
representative of a user. The Administrator shall conduct the hearing and take
evidence. At the hearing, all testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded
stenographically. The transcript shall be make available to the public or any
party to the hearing upon full payment of the costs of the transcript. Within
ten (10) days of the hearing, the Administrator shall transmit to the Village
Council his written recommendations for enforcement action against the
discharger, together with his written report of the evidence and a complete
transcript or the hearing. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the

and policy of this chapter. The Administrator shall give written notice to the
user of the date, time, and place of each meeting of the Village Council at
which the recommendations of the Administrator shall be considered.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the Village and the user
may enter into an agreement to correct the violations and to accomplish the
purpose and policy of this chapter, subject to the following:
      (1)    The agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Administrator
and the agent or officer of the user;
      (2)    If the Administrator has transmitted his recommendations to the
Village Council, the agreement must be approved by Village Council;
      (3)    The agreement must provide that all violations of this chapter
will be corrected;
      (4)    All costs of the hearing to show cause and all costs incurred by
the Village must be paid in full by the user; and
      (5)    The user must agree to any additional reporting requirements that
the Village Council deems necessary to protect the Sewer Works from further
misuse.
   Any user who fails to appear at a Show Cause Hearing shall be deemed to have
agreed to whatever action is taken by the Village Council as a result of the
Show Cause Hearing. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the user in
accordance with applicable local or State law.
   (e)    Right of Appeal. Any user or any interested party shall have the
right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Village Council
on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written
reply. The request shall be filed within ten (10) days of action resulting from
this chapter. In the event that such inquiry is by a user and deals with
matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement
activity relating to an alleged violation is pending, receipt of the user's
request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid
written reply. The Village Council shall convene a hearing to discuss the
matter within thirty (30) days of receipt of said request. The Village Council
may grant continuances if deemed necessary. A written decision on the request
shall be issued within ten (10) days of the hearing. Appeal of any final order
entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and
State law.
   (f)    Emergency Suspension of Service. The Village Council may, for good
cause shown, suspend an industrial user’s waste discharge permit and/or suspend
the wastewater treatment service to a user when it appears to the Village
Council that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an
imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or to the
environment, interferes with the operation of the sewage works, or violates any
pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any user notified of the
suspension of the Village's wastewater treatment service shall immediately
cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the user to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Village may commence judicial proceedings to
compel compliance with such order. The Village shall have such remedies to
collect all fees incurred from such proceedings as it has to collect other
sewer service charges. The Village Council shall reinstate the wastewater
treatment service and terminate judicial proceedings upon proof by the user of
the elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the
threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
   (g)   Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication. At least annually, the
Administrator shall publish a list of all industrial users which at any time
during the previous twelve (12) months were in significant non-compliance (SNC)
with applicable pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision,
an industrial user is in significant non-compliance if its violations meet one
of the following criteria:
      (1)    Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty (60) percent or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit
or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)    Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period equal or exceed the
product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the
applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD5, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH);
      (3)    Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer term average) that the Administrator determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of WWTP personnel or the general public);
      (4)    Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare, or to the environment or has resulted in the
Village's exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)    Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days after the schedule date,
a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)    Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day
compliance reports, periodic self monitoring reports, and reports on compliance
with compliance schedules;
      (7)    Failure to accurately report non-compliance; or
      (8)    Any other violation, or group of violations, which the
Administrator determines will or has adversely affected the operation or
implementation of the Village's pretreatment program.
   (h)    Administrative Fines. Any user who violates this chapter or any
orders or permit issued hereunder, may be assessed, on a strict liability
basis, administrative fines not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1000) per
violation. Each day a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate
violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled service
charge and the Village shall have such other collection remedies as it has to
collect other service charges.
   (i)    Recovery of Costs Incurred by the Village. Any user violating any of
the provisions of this chapter or who discharges or causes a discharge
producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the Village
sewage works shall be liable to the Village for any expense, loss, or damage
caused by such violation or discharge, including any EPA fines incurred by the
Village as a result of the violation. The Administrator shall bill the user for
the costs incurred by the Village for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work
caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall
constitute a violation of this chapter enforceable under the provisions of
subsection (c) hereof.
(Ord. 10-96. Passed 3-25-96.)
925.09 JUDICIAL REMEDIES.
   (a)    Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the
Administrator with respect to the conduct of a user contrary to the provisions
of Section

a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or both
of two constituents of the water or wastes:
      (1)   Total suspended solids, and/or
      (2)   Five day BOD at twenty (20) degrees centigrade and as herein
provided.
   (c)   When either or both the total suspended solids and the BOD of a water
or waste accepted for admission to the system exceed the values of their
constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as
the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
      (1)   Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.23/lb. = suspended
solids surcharge.
      (2)   Pounds of excess BOD per day x $0.28/lb. = BOD surcharge.
   (d)   In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the user charges as
defined in Section
929.02.
   (e)   The pounds of BOD per day and/or pounds of suspended solids per day,
above the concentrations previously described for normal strength sewage that
are discharged to the sewerage system, shall be determined by the Village of
Plain City or its authorized representative.
   (f)   In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the Village
shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other
pollutant into the sewage system or for any other reason that it deems
necessary and appropriate, such as excessively high rates of discharge. (Ord.
25-98. Passed 1-11-99.)
929.031 SURCHARGE FEE FOR DEBT RETIREMENT.
   (a)   Fee Imposed. There is hereby enacted a Waste Water Treatment Plant
Upgrade and Expansion Surcharge Fee in the amount of seven dollars ($7.00) per
month per unit or unit user.
   (b)   Definitions. The terms “unit” or “unit user” as used in this section
shall be defined to mean each individual trailer or lot within a mobile home
trailer park, or each individual unit or area of a building, land or structure
separately owned, occupied or rented and to which water service is furnished by
the Village of Plain City, Ohio. The terms “sewer plant” and “waste water
treatment plant” have equal meaning.
   (c)   Placement and Use. The Sewer Surcharge Fee shall be placed in the
Enterprise Debt Service Reserve Fund of the Village, designated and used for
recovery of the costs incident to the OWDA debt incurred for the previous
upgrade and expansion of the existing municipal sewer plant of the Village of
Plain City, Ohio. (Ord. 2-17. Passed 1-30-17.)
929.04 SEWER TAPPING CHARGES.
   (a)   Except as hereinafter provided, all residential sewer customers who
connect to or tap on to the sewage collection system of the Village, for the
purpose of receiving sewage treatment service shall pay a tapping charge. The
residential sewer tapping charge shall be the sum of the cost of the sewer
parts, inspection, labor, equipment and street repair provided by the Village.
   The residential sewer tapping charge shall be calculated by the Village
Administrator in accordance with the following formula:
TC = SP + I + L + E + SR
TC   Tapping Charge
SP   Sewer Parts (1)
I   =Inspection (2)
L   =Labor (3)
E   =Equipment (4)
SR   Street Repair (5)
      (1)   Sewer parts. The sewer parts portion of the residential sewer
tapping charge shall consist of the cost of the following parts, when provided
by the Village:
         A.   Wye saddle;
         B.   Pipe (on a per foot basis); and
         C.   Tap machine charge.
   For the purpose of imposing a cost for these parts, the Village
Administrator shall periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but no less
than annually, contact a minimum of three parts suppliers and obtain cost
quotations for the provision of such individual parts and machine usage. The
Village Administrator shall then average the three quotations, and such average
shall be imposed as the sewer parts portion of the residential sewer tapping
charge until such time as the next average shall be calculated.
      (2)   Inspection. The inspection portion of the residential sewer tapping
charge shall consist of the cost to the Village of providing such service. For
the purpose of imposing a cost for this service, the Village Administrator
shall periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but no less than annually,
calculate the average hourly period required to inspect and approve a
residential sewer tap and the hourly cost of the employee involved. Such hourly
cost shall include the hourly wage of such employee and the hourly cost of
benefits provided to such employee by the Village. The average hourly period
shall then be multiplied by the hourly cost of the employee, and the resulting
product shall be the inspection portion of the residential sewer tapping
charge.
      (3)   Labor. When labor is provided by the Village in the installation of
a residential sewer tap, the labor portion of the residential sewer tapping
charge shall consist of the cost to the Village of providing such labor. For
the purpose of imposing a cost for this labor, the Village Administrator shall
periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but no less than annually,
calculate the average number of employees required to complete a residential
sewer tap, the average hourly period required for them to perform such work,
and the hourly cost to the Village of the type of employees involved. Such
hourly cost shall include the hourly wage of such an employee and the hourly
cost of benefits provided to such an employee by the Village. The average
number of employees needed shall then be multiplied by average hourly period
necessary to complete the work. The resulting product shall then be multiplied
by the hourly cost of such an employee, and the resulting product shall be the
inspection portion of the residential sewer tapping charge.
      (4)   Equipment. When equipment is provided by the Village in the
installation of a residential sewer tap, the equipment portion of the
residential sewer tapping charge shall consist of the cost to the Village of
providing such equipment. For the purpose of imposing a cost for this
equipment, the Village Administrator shall periodically, when deemed
appropriate by him, but no less than annually, calculate the types of equipment
used and the average hourly period of time during which equipment is in use in
the making of a residential sewer tap. He shall then contact a minimum of three
commercial firms engaged in the provision of equipment with operators and
obtain cost quotations for the hourly cost of providing the various types of
such equipment with operators. The Village Administrator shall then average the
three quotations for each type of equipment. He shall then multiply the average
hourly cost of providing the various types of equipment by the average hourly
period of use. He shall then total the resulting products, and such sum shall
be imposed as the equipment portion of the residential sewer tapping charge
until such time as the next average shall be calculated.
      (5)   Street repair. When street repair services are to be provided by
the Village in the installation of a residential sewer tap, the street repair
portion of the residential sewer tapping charge shall consist of an estimate of
the cost to the Village of providing such street repair. In making such
estimate the Village Administrator shall apply the hourly labor, equipment and
inspection rates stated above to the estimated time and quantities necessary to
complete such repair. To this amount the Village Administrator shall add a
charge for estimated quantities of asphalt and bedding material to be used at
the current unit price then in force under the annual Village contract for road
materials. The resulting sum for labor, equipment, inspection and materials
shall be imposed as the street repair portion of the residential sewer tapping
charge. Upon the completion of the street repair work, the Village
Administrator shall determine the actual expense to the Village for labor,
equipment, inspection and materials in accordance with the above, and either
collect any difference due or refund any surplus funds received as the street
repair portion of the residential sewer tapping charge.
   (b)   The purpose of the tapping charge is to recover the cost of installing
the local sewer service connection which terminates at the customer’s property
line. Other (non-residential) sewer tapping charges shall be determined by
Council. In those areas where no service taps have been previously installed,
the foregoing fees may be waived by the Village Administrator, and the property
owner allowed to install the service tap and line at said customer’s own
expense. In such cases, the customer shall pay an inspection fee determined by
the Village Administrator in the manner set forth in subsection (a)(2) above.
The tapping charge and/or inspection fee is payable at the time service is
provided. (Ord. 25-98. Passed 1-11-99.)
929.05 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.
   Recognizing that there are no industrial users, as defined in 40 CFR 35.905,
connected to and/or discharging to the sewer system of the Village at the
present time, it is hereby resolved that if, in the future, industrial users do
discharge to the Village sewage system an industrial cost recovery system will
be established in accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
requirements. (Ord. 25-98. Passed 1-11-99.)
929.06 CAPACITY CHARGE FEE.
   (a)    A Sanitary Sewer Capacity Charge Fee, being a tap-in or connection
fee representing a reasonable relationship to the entire cost of having
provided and created an adequate sanitary sewer system, including wastewater

   (a)   Single Family Residential. Except as hereinafter provided, all single
family residential water customers who connect to or tap on to the water system
of the Village, for the purpose of receiving water service shall pay a tapping
charge. The single family residential water tapping charge shall be the sum of
the cost of the water parts, inspection, labor, equipment and street repair
provided by the Village. The single family residential water tapping charge
shall be calculated by the Village Administrator in accordance with the
following formula:
TC = WP + I + L + E + SR
TC   Tapping Charge
WP   Water Parts (a)
I   =Inspection (b)
L   =Labor (c)
E   =Equipment (d)
SR   Street Repair (e)
      (1)   Water parts. The water parts portion of the single family
residential water tapping charge shall consist of the cost of the following
parts, when provided by the Village:
         A.   Meter (inside);
         B.   Meter (outside);
         C.   Setter;
         D.   Meter pit;
         E.   Meter pit extension;

         J.   Curb stop;
         K.   Crop stop;
         L.   Gaskets; and
         M.   Tap machine charge.
   For the purpose of imposing a cost for these parts, the Village
Administrator shall periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but no less
than annually, contact a minimum of three parts suppliers and obtain cost
quotations for the provision of such individual parts and machine usage. The
Village Administrator shall then average the three quotations, and such average
shall be imposed as the water parts portion of the single family residential
water tapping charge until such time as the next average shall be calculated.
      (2)   Inspection. The inspection portion of the single family residential
water tapping charge shall consist of the cost to the Village of providing such
service. For the purpose of imposing a cost for this service, the Village
Administrator shall periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but no less
than annually, calculate the average hourly period required to inspect and
approve a single family residential water tap and the hourly cost of the
employee involved. Such hourly cost shall include the hourly wage of such
employee and the hourly cost of benefits provided to such employee by the
Village. The average hourly period shall then be multiplied by the hourly cost
of the employee, and the resulting product shall be the inspection portion of
the single family residential water tapping charge.
      (3)   Labor. When labor is provided by the Village in the installation of
a single family residential water tap, the labor portion of the single family
residential water tapping charge shall consist of the cost to the Village of
providing such labor. For the purpose of imposing a cost for this labor, the
Village Administrator shall periodically, when deemed appropriate by him, but
no less than annually, calculate the average number of employees required to
complete a single family residential water tap, the average hourly period
required for them to perform such work, and the hourly cost to the Village of
the type of employees involved. Such hourly cost shall include the hourly wage
of such an employee and the hourly cost of benefits provided to such an
employee by the Village. The average number of employees needed shall then be
multiplied by average hourly period necessary to complete the work. The
resulting product shall then be multiplied by the hourly cost of such an
employee, and the resulting product shall be in the inspection portion of the
single family residential water tapping charge.
      (4)   Equipment. When equipment is provided by the Village in the
installation of a single family residential water tap, the equipment portion of
the single family residential water tapping charge shall consist of the cost to
the Village of providing such equipment. For the purpose of imposing a cost for
this equipment, the Village Administrator shall periodically, when deemed
appropriate by him, but no less than annually, calculate the types of equipment
used and the average hourly period of time during which equipment is in use in
the making of a single family residential water tap. He shall then contact a
minimum of three (3) commercial firms engaged in the provision of equipment
with operators and obtain cost quotations for the hourly cost of providing the
various types of such equipment with operators. The Village Administrator shall
then average the three quotations for each type of equipment. He shall then
multiply the average hourly cost of providing the various types of equipment by
the average hourly period of use. He shall then total the resulting products,
and such sum shall be imposed as the equipment portion of the single family
residential water tapping charge until such time as the next average shall be
calculated.
      (5)   Street repair. When street repair services are to be provided by
the Village in the installation of a single family residential water tap, the
street repair portion of the single family residential water tapping charge
shall consist of an estimate of the cost to the Village of providing such
street repair. In making such estimate the Village Administrator shall apply
the hourly labor, equipment and inspection rates stated above to the estimated
time and quantities necessary to complete such repair. To this amount the
Village Administrator shall add a charge for estimated quantities of asphalt
and bedding material to be used at the current unit price then in force under
the annual Village contract for road materials. The resulting sum for labor,
equipment, inspection and materials shall be imposed as the street repair
portion of the single family residential water tapping charge. Upon the
completion of the street repair work, the Village Administrator shall determine
the actual expense to the Village for labor, equipment, inspection and
materials in accordance with the above, and either collect any difference due
or refund any surplus funds received as the street repair portion of the single
family residential water tapping charge.
    (b)   Purpose. The purpose of the single family water tapping charge is to
recover the cost of installing the local water service connection which
terminates at the customer’s property line.
   (c)   Replacement Meter or Parts - Single Family Residential. The charge for
the replacement of a single family meter, or any other water part for a single
family residential service, shall be calculated and applied by the Village
Administrator in the same manner as the water parts portion of the single
family water tapping charge, and shall recover the cost for the water parts
(including meter) provided. This charge shall apply whether the replacement is
the result of a non-functional meter or an owner request for replacement. In
the case of a frozen meter, the charge shall be for the replacement of the
bottom of the meter only.
   (d)   Other Than Single Family Water Tapping Charge or Replacement. The
water tapping charges to be imposed for a water tap or for replacement of a
tap, or a meter or any other water part to property other than “single family
residential” shall be determined by Council.
   (e)   Waiver. In those areas where no water service taps have been
previously installed, the foregoing fees may be waived by the Village
Administrator, and the property owner allowed to install the water service tap
and line at said customer’s own expense. In such cases, the customer shall pay
an inspection fee determined by the Village Administrator in the manner set
forth in subsection (a)(2) hereof.
   (f)   Payment. The water tapping charge and/or inspection fee are payable at
the time service is provided.
   (g)   Meters; Ownership. Each water meter shall remain the property of the
property owner, subject to the right of the Village to inspect and/or calibrate
the same. Such meter shall be subject to access by the Village during all
regular business hours and shall not be unreasonably obstructed from inspection
by the Village. All meters shall be of a type approved by the Village
Administrator and obtained through the Village. (Ord. 20-98. Passed 11-9-98.)

   The terms “unit” or “unit user” as used in this chapter shall be defined to
mean each individual trailer or lot within a mobile home trailer park, or each
individual unit or area of a building, land, structure or use which is
separately owned, occupied or rented and to which water is furnished by the
Village. (Ord. 20-98. Passed 11-9-98.)
933.06 SERVICE AREA.
   Excepting those properties located outside of the Village Limits which are
currently receiving water service, no water service shall be extended to
properties located outside of the Village of Plain City. However, Village
Council may grant special permission for water service extension outside of
Village limits via legislative approval of the majority of Council and subject
to agreements for the provision of such service extension that may be required.
Properties receiving special permission for connection to Village water service
outside of Village limits shall be charged ten percent (10%) greater than those
rates established for properties within Village limits. (Ord. 09-2022. Passed
5-23-22.)

   The Village Administrator may adjust billings arising from leakage.
(Ord. 20-98. Passed 11-9-98.)
933.08 CAPACITY CHARGE FEE.
   (a)   A Water Capacity Charge Fee, being a tap-in or connection fee
representing a reasonable relationship to the entire cost of having provided
and created an adequate water system, including water treatment plant and
wells, shall be imposed upon all future users of the currently unused service
capacity of the Village Water System.
   (b)   Such Water Capacity Charge Fee shall be imposed upon the basis of the
size of the water tap servicing the property. Such fee shall be collected, and
water capacity reserved for the user, in the following manner:
      (1)   In the case of a future user connecting to the water system for the
first time, the Water Capacity Charge Fee shall be paid and water capacity
reserved for the user, as follows:
         A.   As regards development which has completed the final plat
procedure of the Subdivision Regulations, water capacity shall be reserved for
its use at the time this water capacity charge fee and the sanitary sewer
capacity charge fee imposed by Section
929.06 are paid, together with the RPM capacity charge fee imposed by Ordinance
6-98, if applicable.
            If not paid sooner, this Water Capacity Charge Fee shall be paid no
later than the time the tap request for individual water service to a lot is
made. No reservation of capacity shall occur at such time unless the sanitary
sewer capacity charge fee imposed by Section
929.06 is also paid, together with the RPM capacity charge fee imposed by
Ordinance 6-98, if applicable.
   Once reserved, the water capacity shall be allocated to the development for
which the fees were paid, and shall not be transferable to another development.
   Development which is required to undergo the final plat procedure of the
Subdivision Regulations, but which has not completed that procedure, shall not
be eligible to reserve water capacity or to pay the necessary capacity charge
fees.
   If the water tap connections are not made within three years of the payment
of the fees, water capacity may, at the option of the Village, no longer be
reserved and may be made available for use by others. In such event, and at the
option of the payor, a refund of the capacity charge fees may be made,
provided, however, that in the refund no interest shall be paid upon the amount
of the fees paid. No other refund of Water Capacity Charge Fees shall be made
once such fees are paid.
         B.   As regards development which is not required to undergo the final
plat procedure of the Subdivision Regulations, this Water Capacity Charge Fee
shall be paid prior to final approval of its construction plans. Water capacity
shall be reserved for its use upon such payment of this Water Capacity Charge
Fee and the sanitary sewer capacity charge fee imposed by Section
929.06, together with the RPM capacity charge fee imposed by Ordinance 6-98, if
applicable.
   Once reserved, the water capacity shall be allocated to the development for
which the fees were paid, and shall not be transferable to another development.
   If the water tap connections are not made within three years of the payment
of the fees, water capacity may, at the option of the Village, no longer be
reserved and may be made available for use by others. In such event, and at the
option of the payor, a refund of the capacity charge fees may be made,
provided, however, that in the refund no interest shall be paid upon the amount
of the fees paid. No other refund of capacity charge fees shall be made once
such fees are paid.
      (2)   In the case of an enlargement in the size of the water tap
servicing the property of an existing or future user, the capacity charge fee
shall be immediately paid at such time as the Village becomes aware of an
enlargement in the size of the water tap servicing the property;
      (3)   In the case of future water connections made for fire purposes
only, the capacity charge fee shall be immediately paid at such time as the
Village becomes aware of such water tap servicing the property.
   (c)   The amount of the capacity charge fee shall be as follows:
      (1)   The capacity charge fee for future users connecting to the water
system for the first time shall be set forth within the Village Water and Sewer
Rate, Surcharge and Capacity Fee Schedule maintained in the Village Water
Office and published on the Village website at www.plain-city.com.
   The Water Capacity Charge Fee for a Water Tap Size greater than 6" shall be
separately determined by Council acting by ordinance or resolution.
      (2)   The Water Capacity Charge Fee for existing or future users
enlarging the size of the water tap servicing their property shall be the
difference between the amount established for the size of the enlarged water
connection and the amount established for the size of the prior water
connection. The values to be used are those set forth above, or in cases where
one or both of the involved Water Tap Size(s) are greater than 6", the value(s)
established by Council acting by ordinance or resolution for the water
connection(s) greater than 6".
      (3)   The Water Capacity Charge Fee for future connections to the Village
water system for fire protection purposes shall be one-half (½) of that amount
established above for the size of the water connection being made. All water
service for fire protection purposes must have its own dedicated line which
cannot be used for any other purpose.
      (4)   No user, current or future, shall be entitled to any rebate or
refund of the Water Capacity Charge Fee from the Village in the event that the
size of the water tap servicing their property is decreased.
   (d)   Such capacity charge fee shall be imposed and collected by the Village
Administrator at the time set forth in subsection (b) hereof, and under no
circumstance shall the permit for a water and/or sewer connection tap be issued
if such capacity charge fee is not paid.
   In the event that an unauthorized water tap is discovered by the Village
Administrator which provided initial service to the property, enlarged the
authorized water tap, or connected for fire purposes only, water service to the
property may be terminated until such time as the appropriate capacity charge
fee is paid together with an amount equal to ten percent (10%) interest upon
the unpaid capacity charge fee from the date such unauthorized water tap was
made and all reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in
enforcing such capacity charge fee.
   (e)   The proceeds of the capacity charge fee shall be paid into the Water
Capital Improvement Fund.
(Ord. 13-17. Passed 5-8-17.)
   (f)   (1)   The water capacity charge fee for fire suppression purposes
under Section
933.08(c)(3) of the Village of Plain City Municipal Code of Ordinances is
hereby eliminated for future fire suppression water line installation within
the Uptown District whose boundaries are depicted in Exhibit A attached to
Ordinance 22-20 and incorporated herein.
      (2)   The elimination of the water capacity charge fee above does not
amend those charges and fees referenced under Section
933.04 of the Village of Plain City Municipal Code of Ordinances related to
water tapping charges. Installation of future water lines for fire suppression
purposes will still be subject to all other applicable inspections and other
conditions set forth by the Village’s regulations. (Ord. 22-20. Passed 11-23-

the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. On demand the
owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Administrator any information which he may request regarding the piping system
or systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when
demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Administrator, be deemed evidence
of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to discontinue,
after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service to any
property wherein any connection in violation of this section is known to exist,
and to take such other precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to
eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply distribution
mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored until such

   This Ordinance shall be known and may hereafter be referred to as the "The
Village of Plain City Development Impact Fee Procedures Ordinance" (hereinafter
"Procedures Ordinance").
(Ord. 14-20. Passed 9-14-20.)
961.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purposes and intent of this Ordinance are as follows:
   (a)   To establish uniform and consistent procedures for the development,
implementation, imposition, calculation, collection, deposit, expenditure and
administration of all development impact fees adopted by the Village.
   (b)    To be consistent with, and to facilitate the implementation of, the
goals, objectives and policies of the Village of Plain City Comprehensive Plan,
and all elements
thereof relating to the provision of public facilities needed to meet the
demands created by new growth and development, and relating to appropriate,
fair and equitable cost sharing of such public facilities.
   (c)    To ensure that new development pays, at the time of development
approval or issuance of a zoning permit, a proportionate share of the cost of
system improvements needed to serve the projected new development.
   (d)    To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are
properly incorporated and will be met by the Village.
      (Ord. 14-20. Passed 9-14-20.)
  
961.03 DEFINITIONS. 
   The words or phrases used in Sections
961.01 through

that no such amendment shall be adopted without a written report detailing the
reasons and need for the amendment; and further provided however that no such
amendment shall be undertaken to any particular category of capital
improvements pursuant to this Ordinance if the same would have the result of

review of substantially all of the criteria set forth in subsection (c) hereof
unless the then proposed amendment includes such a review.
   (c)    Annual Review and Report. At least once every year not later than
March 1st of each year, beginning in 2021, the Village Administrator or his/her
designee shall coordinate the preparation and submission of an Annual Report to

         N.    Such other facts as may be deemed relevant by the Village
Council.
      (3)    The Village Administrator or his/her designee shall submit the
Impact Fee Annual Report to the Village Council, which shall receive the Annual
Report and which may take such actions as it deems appropriate, including, but
not limited to, requesting additional data or analyses and holding public
workshops and/or public hearings.
         (Ord. 14-20. Passed 9-14-20.)
961.05 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)    Development Subject to Impact Fees. Impact fees shall be imposed on
new land development in the Village which, for purposes hereof, may be divided
into impact fee districts by the Village Council. All development, both
residential and nonresidential, as defined in
Appendix A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, may be
subject to the imposition of one (1) or more development impact fees for
particular public facilities; provided, however, that the type and nature of
the development project must create an additional demand and need for system
improvements for the public facility in order to maintain the adopted level of
service (LOS) standard, and is not otherwise exempt.
   (b)    Municipal Planning Areas. Impact fees imposed by the Village shall,
if necessary and appropriate, be collected by other municipalities or by the
County on new land development within the Village's municipal planning area,
but outside of the Village limits, pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
which provides that the impact fees collected be transferred to the appropriate
Village fund for expenditure in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance.
   (c)    Development Not Subject to Impact Fees. The following structures and
activities, which might otherwise be construed as development are exempt from
the imposition of development impact fees:
      (1)   Previously-issued zoning permits or development plan approvals. No
impact fee shall be imposed on land development for which a zoning permit and/
or a development plan approval has been issued prior to January 1, 2021. In the
event that a zoning permit and/or development plan approval has been issued
prior to January 1, 2021, but construction has not commenced within 6 months
from the date of issuance of the permit, then the impact fee shall be imposed
and paid prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.
      (2)    Previous Payment of Impact Fees. Subject to the requirements of
Section
961.06 of this Ordinance, no impact fees shall be due at a later stage of the
development permit or approval process if impact fees have been paid for such
category of capital improvements at an earlier stage in the development permit
or approval process, unless said fees were reimbursed to the original payor or
subsequent property owner.
      (3)    No net increase in dwelling units. No impact fee shall be imposed
on any new residential development which does not add a new dwelling unit
(service unit).
      (4)    No net increase in non-residential square footage. No impact fee
shall be imposed on any new non-residential development which does not add
square footage, unless the new non-residential development increases the demand
for capital improvements (service units) for which impact fees are being
imposed.
      (5)    Other uses. No impact fee shall be imposed on a use, development,
project, structure, building, fence, sign or other activity, whether or not a
zoning permit is required, which does not result in an increase in the demand
for capital improvements (service units). Except upon a determination by the
Village Administrator pursuant to Section
961.06(b)(4), no impact fee shall be imposed on any new development or use not
listed in Sections
962.04,
963.04, or
964.04.
      (6)    New land developments which are the subject of a Development
Agreement containing provisions in conflict with this Ordinance, but only to
the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.
   (d)    Effect of Imposition/Payment of Development Impact Fees on Village
Planning and Zoning Code.
      (1)    The payment of development impact fees shall not entitle the fee
payor to development approval nor a zoning permit unless all other applicable
requirements, standards and conditions of the Village Zoning Ordinance and all
other applicable Village codes, ordinances and/or procedures, have been met.
Such other requirements, standards and conditions are independent of the
requirement for payment of a development impact fee.
      (2)    Neither this Ordinance nor a specific development impact fee
ordinance shall affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, the
permitted density/intensity of development, the applicable design and
improvement standards, or any other applicable standards or requirements of the
Village of Plain City Code or Zoning Ordinance which shall be operative and
which shall remain in full force and effect without limitation.
   (e)    Exclusive Method to Impose Development Impact Fees. Requirements for
developers to pay, as a condition of development approval or issuance of a
development permit, in whole or in part, for system improvements may be imposed
by the Village only by way of development impact fees imposed pursuant to this
Ordinance and individual public facility development impact fee ordinances
adopted by the Village.
   (f)   Other Methods of Requiring Capital Improvements. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Ordinance, the Village retains its power, to the extent
authorized, to impose fees, to require contributions and to require dedication
of land for capital improvements.
(Ord. 14-20. Passed 9-14-20.)
961.06 IMPOSITION, CALCULATION; COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES; OFFSETS
AND REFUNDS.
   (a)    Imposition. Impact fees shall be calculated by the Village
Administrator at the time of application for a zoning permit and shall be paid
by the applicant prior to the issuance of a zoning permit.
   (b)    Calculation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of an application for a zoning permit, the Village
Administrator shall determine:
         A.    Whether it is a residential or non-residential use;
         B.    The specific category (type) of residential or non-residential
development, if applicable;
         C.    If residential, the number of new dwelling units;
         D.    If non-residential, the number of new or additional square feet
of gross floor area (rounded up to the nearest square foot) and the proposed
use; and
         E.    The impact fee district in which the new land development is
located (if applicable).
      (2)    Upon receipt of an application for a zoning permit, the Village
Administrator shall determine whether it is for a change in use. In such cases,
the impact fee due shall be based only on the incremental increase in the fee
for the additional service units added by the change in use.
      (3)    After making these determinations, the Village Administrator shall
calculate the demand for the capital improvements (service units) added by the
new land development for each capital improvements category for which an impact
fee is being imposed and calculate the applicable impact fee by multiplying the
demand (service units) added by the new development by the amount of the
applicable impact fee per service unit, incorporating any applicable offset if
set forth in the particular impact fee calculation methodology.
      (4)    If the type of land use proposed for land development is not
expressly listed in the particular impact fee ordinance and schedule, pursuant
to a generally-accepted land use classification system and methodology, the
Village Administrator shall:
         A.    Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the
impact fee based on that land use; or
         B.    Identify the broader land use category within which the
specified land use would fit and calculate the impact fee based on that land
use category; or
         C.    At the option of the applicant, or the Village, determine the
basis used to calculate the fee pursuant to an independent impact analysis of
service units added. The independent fee calculation shall comply with the
following:
            1.    The applicant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for
preparing the independent impact analysis, which shall be reviewed for approval
by the Village Administrator, and, if appropriate, other Village staff or
officials, prior to payment of the fee.
            2.    The independent impact analysis shall measure the impact (in
service units) that the proposed development will have on the particular
category of capital improvements at issue, and shall be based on the same
methodologies used in the impact fee calculation methodology report, and shall
be supported by professionally acceptable data and assumptions.
            3.    After review of the independent impact analysis submitted by
the applicant, the Village Administrator shall accept or reject the analysis
and provide written notice to the applicant of its decision on a form provided
for such purpose within thirty (30) days. If the independent impact analysis is
rejected, the written notice shall provide an explanation of the
insufficiencies of the analysis.
      (5)    An applicant may request a non-binding estimate of impact fees due
for a particular land development at any time by filing a request on a form
provided for such purpose by the Village; provided, however, that such estimate
may be subject to change when a formal application for a zoning permit for land
development is made. Such non-binding estimate is solely for the benefit of the
prospective applicant and shall in no way bind the Village nor preclude it from
making amendments or revisions to any provisions of this Ordinance, the
specific impact fee implementing ordinances or the impact fee schedules. The
Village's non-binding estimate will not constitute a final decision and may not
be appealed pursuant to Section
961.08, herein.
      (6)    The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple-use land
development shall be based upon the aggregated demand (in service units) for
each category of capital improvements generated by each land use type in the
land development.
      (7)    The calculation of impact fees due from a phased land development
shall be based upon the demand (in service units) generated by each specific
land use within the phase of development for which a separate zoning permit is
requested.
      (8)    Impact fees shall be calculated based on the impact fee amount in
effect at the time of application for a zoning permit.
      (9)    Any appeal from a final decision of a Village official made
pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be to the Village Council pursuant to
Section
961.08, herein.
   (c)    Offsets.
      (1)    Offsets against the amount of an impact fee due from a land
development shall be provided for, among other things, contributions made or to
be made in the future in cash, or by dedication of land or by actual
construction of all or part of a capital improvement by the affected property
owner for capital improvements meeting or exceeding the demand generated by the
land development and the contribution is determined by the Village to be an
acceptable substitute for the cost of capital improvements which are included
in the particular impact fee calculation methodology and/or the Village's
capital improvement plan. The amount of the offset shall be determined as
follows:
         A.    Land dedications. Land dedications shall be valued at one
hundred percent (100%) of the most recent assessed value for the land to be
dedicated or the land's fair market value based on its appraised value on the
date of transfer to the Village. Appraisals shall be conducted by an appraiser
certified by the State of Ohio, selected and paid for by the applicant.
Appraisals shall be performed using generally-accepted appraisal practices. If
the Village disagrees with the appraisal, the Village may engage another
appraiser at the Village's expense and the offset shall be equal to the average
of the two appraisals. If either the applicant or the Village rejects the
average of the two appraisals, a third may be obtained (costs to be shared by
the parties) and shall be binding on the parties. The third appraiser shall be
selected by the first two appraisers.
         B.    Capital Facilities. Offsets for capital facilities constructed
by the applicant shall be based upon the actual cost of construction as
verified by receipts.
      (2)    Based upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the amount of the excess contribution shall be determined by the
Village Council upon receipt of an application form requesting an offset;
provided, however, that (i) the Village will make no reimbursement for excess
contributions unless and until the particular capital improvements fund has
sufficient revenue to make the reimbursement without jeopardizing the
continuity of the Village's capital improvements program and (ii) the excess
contribution may not be transferred or credited to any other type of impact
fees calculated to be due from that development for other type of capital
improvements. The determination of the eligibility for and the amount of the
credit shall be made by the Village Council, based upon the recommendation of
the Planning Commission, on a form provided for such purposes. Appeals from a
final decision of the Village Council pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be
to the Court of Common Pleas for Plain City County.
      (3)    No offset shall be allowed unless the Village Council has approved
the contribution or expenditure before it is made.
      (4)    Offsets for dedication of land or provision of capital
improvements shall be applicable only as to impact fees imposed for the same
types of capital improvements which are proposed to be dedicated or provided.
Even if the value of the dedication of land or provision of a capital
improvement exceeds the impact fee due for the type of capital improvement, the
excess value may not be transferred to impact fees calculated to be due from
the applicant for other types of capital improvements. Offsets may, however, be
transferred to other applicants within the same development for the same type
of capital improvement.
   (d)    Refunds. 
      (1)    Eligibility for refunds.
         A.    Expiration or Revocation of Zoning Permit. An applicant who has
paid an impact fee for a land development for which the necessary zoning permit
has expired or for which the zoning permit has been revoked prior to
construction shall be eligible to apply for a refund of impact fees paid on a
form provided by the Village for such purposes.
         B.    Failure of Village to Appropriate Impact Fee Funds Within Time
Limit. The current property owner may apply for a refund of impact fees paid by
an applicant if the Village has failed to appropriate the impact fees collected
from the applicant within the time limit established herein. The refund
application shall be made on a form provided by the Village for such purposes.
         C.    Abandonment of Development or Reduction in Impact After
Initiation of Construction. An applicant who has paid an impact fee for a new
land development for which a zoning permit has been issued and pursuant to
which (i) construction has been initiated, but which construction is abandoned
prior to completion or (ii) has a reduced number of dwelling units or
nonresidential square footage upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall
be eligible for a refund. No refund shall be available to abandoned projects
unless the uncompleted structure is completely demolished.
      (2)    An administrative fee established by the Fee Schedule in Section
965.02, shall be deducted from the amount of any refund granted and shall be

appropriate impact fee funds for relevant capital improvements.
      (7)    The Village may, at its option, make refunds of impact fees by
direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other impact fees due for
the same category of capital improvements for new land development on the same
property, or by other means subject to agreement with the property owner.
      (8)    Any appeal from a final decision of a Village official made
pursuant to this subsection (d) shall be to the Village Council pursuant to

Village Attorney and Finance Director, has been posted with the Village.
      (2)    The Village Administrator shall collect an impact fee at the time
of issuance of a zoning permit even if impact fees were paid by the applicant
at an earlier time in the development permit or approval process if the amount
of the impact fees have increased since such prior approval. Except as provided
for in Section
961.05(c), the applicant shall only be liable for the difference between the
impact fees paid earlier and those in effect at the time of issuance of the
subsequent zoning permit.
   (f)    Enforcement. 
      (1)    The Village may withhold the requested development approval or
development permit, including but not limited to a certificate of occupancy, or

   (a)    Impact Fee Accounts. An impact fee account shall be established by
the Village for each category of capital improvements for which impact fees are
imposed. Such account shall clearly identify the category, account, or fund for
which the impact fee has been imposed. Subaccounts may be established for
individual impact fee districts. All impact fees collected by the Village shall
be deposited into the appropriate impact fee account or subaccount, which shall
be interest bearing. All interest earned on monies deposited to such account
shall be credited to and shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of
each such account shall be capable of being accounted for separately from all
other Village funds, over time. The Village shall establish and implement
necessary accounting controls to ensure that the impact fee funds are properly
deposited, accounted for and appropriated in accordance with this Ordinance and
any other applicable legal requirements.
   (b)    Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds. 
      (1)    Impact fee funds may be appropriated for capital improvements and
capital improvement expenditures and for the payment of principal, interest and
other financing costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by

shall be detailed on a form provided for such purposes and filed with the
Village Fiscal Officer.

         A.    For the particular category of capital improvements for which
they were imposed, calculated and collected;
         B.    Within the impact fee district where collected unless the impact
fee funds will be appropriated for a capital improvement necessitated by or
serving the new land development as provided herein; and
         C.    Within five (5) years of the beginning of the Fiscal Year
immediately succeeding the date of collection, unless such time period is
extended as provided herein.
      (3)    Development impact fees may not be appropriated for:
         A.    Funding maintenance or repair of capital improvements nor for
operational or personnel expenses associated with the provision of the capital
improvements;
         B.    A purpose other than system improvement costs to create
additional improvements to serve new growth;
         C.    A category of system improvements other than that for which they
were collected; or
         D.    The benefit of service areas other than for which they were
imposed.
      (4)    Impact fee funds may be appropriated for a capital improvement
located outside of the district where collected only if the demand for the
capital improvement is generated in whole or in part by the new land
development or if the capital improvement will actually serve the new land
development.
      (5)    Impact fee funds may be appropriated beyond five (5) years from
the beginning of the Fiscal Year immediately succeeding the date of collection
if the appropriation is for a capital improvement which requires more than five
(5) years to plan, design and construct, and the demand for the capital
improvement is generated in whole or in part by the new land development, or if
the capital improvement will actually serve the new land development. Such
appropriations shall be fully documented on forms provided by the Village for
such purposes.
   
   (c)    Procedure for Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds.
      (1)    The Village shall each year identify capital improvement projects
anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The capital
improvement recommendations shall be based upon the impact fee annual review
set forth herein and such other information as may be relevant, and may be part
of the Village's annual budget and capital improvements programming process.
      (2)    The recommendations shall be consistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance, the particular impact fee ordinances, or other applicable legal
requirements and any guidelines adopted by the Village Council.
      (3)    The Village Council may include impact fee-funded capital
improvements in the Village's annual budget and capital improvements program.
If included, the description of the capital improvement shall specify the
nature, location, capacity to be added, service area, need/demand for, and the
anticipated timing of completion of the capital improvement.
      (4)    The Village Council may authorize impact fee-funded capital
improvements at such other times as may be deemed necessary and appropriate by
the Village Council.
      (5)    The Village Council shall verify that adequate impact fee funds
are or will be available from the appropriate impact fee account for the
particular category of capital improvements.

   (a)    Appeal from Decision of Village Official. An appeal from any final
decision of a Village official pursuant to this Ordinance shall be made to the
Village Council by filing a written appeal on the appropriate Village form with
the Village Administrator, with a copy to the Village Clerk, within thirty (30)
days following the decision which is being appealed. The burden of proof shall

erroneous. All appeals shall detail the specific grounds therefor and all other
relevant information and shall be filed on a form provided by the Village for
such purposes.

   (c)    Permit Issuance and Payment under Protest. If the appeal is
accompanied by a bond or other sufficient in a form satisfactory to the Village
Attorney and the Finance Director in an amount equal to the impact fee
calculated to be due, a zoning permit may be issued to the new land
development. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the imposition or the
collection of the impact fee as calculated by the Village unless a bond or
other sufficient surety has been provided.
   (d)    Mediation. In order to address any disagreement between the fee payor
and the Village relative to the imposition of a development impact fee, the
Village and the fee payor may, upon voluntary agreement, enter into mediation
conducted by a qualified independent party. Participation in mediation does not
preclude the fee payor from pursuing any other available remedies provided
herein, in the Act, or otherwise available by law.
   (e)    Incidental Benefit. The receipt of "incidental benefit" by a third
party property owner or developer within the service area resulting from the
payment of a development impact fee by a fee payor or developer shall not be
considered grounds for exercising the remedies set forth herein.
(Ord. 14-20. Passed 9-14-20.)
961.09 EXEMPTIONS; WAIVERS. 
   (a)    Filing of Application. Petitions for exemptions to the application of
the provisions of this Ordinance or waivers from specific impact fees, or a
portion thereof, shall be filed with the Village Administrator on forms
provided by the Village. The Village Administrator shall verify the accuracy of
the exemption application and forward same to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for its consideration. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
recommend to the Village Council that the exemption application be approved,
denied, or approved with conditions, based on the criteria set forth below.

exempt from the payment of development impact fees.
      (1)    Governmental Entities. Governmental entities proposing development
within the Village may be exempt from the payment of development impact fees
required pursuant to this Ordinance. In order to be exempt, the governmental
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed use either creates no impact on
the capital improvements for which impact fees are collected or that the
applicant is entitled to an exemption by law. Village Council will grant an
exemption only pursuant to a written finding that the applicant has adequately
demonstrated that an exemption is due under this paragraph.
      (2)    Economic Development. Land development projects that will promote
the long-term economic development of the Village may be exempt from the
payment of some or all of the development impact fees required pursuant to this
Ordinance. Projects that promote the long-term economic development of the
Village may be exempt only upon a specific finding by the Village Council that
the proposed project will advance the goals and policies for economic
development as set forth in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)    Effect of Grant of Exemption/Waiver. If the Village Council grants an
exemption or waiver in whole or in part of impact fees otherwise due, the
amount of the impact fees exempted or waived shall be provided by the Village
from non-impact fee funds, as may be provided in the particular impact fee
ordinances establishing such fees for particular capital improvements, and such
funds shall be deposited to the appropriate impact fee account within a
reasonable period of time consistent with the applicable Village capital
improvements program.
   (d)    An appeal from a decision of the Village Council under this section
shall be to the Court of Common Pleas for Madison County, Ohio.
   (e)    Development Agreements. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
Village's authority or ability to enter into Development Agreements with
applicants for new land development which may provide for dedication of land or
actual infrastructure improvements. In lieu of making development impact fee
payments, the fee payor/developer and the Village, by mutual agreement, may
enter into an agreement for the provision, construction and installation of
capital improvements.
      (1)   The Agreement may additionally provide for credits or reimbursement
for costs incurred by a fee payor or developer, including interproject
transfers of credits or reimbursement for "project" improvements which are used
or shared by more than one development project.
      (2)    A development impact fee for system improvements for a specific
capital improvement category may not be imposed on a fee payor or developer who
has entered into a development agreement providing for the provision of capital
improvements for that same capital improvement category. Provided, however,
that development impact fees may still be imposed on the fee payor or developer
for system improvements for another capital improvement category.
      (3)    The development agreement shall include a provision addressing
increases in development impact fees over the life of the development agreement
as well as the applicability of subsequently adopted development impact fees
for other capital improvements over the life of the development agreement and
the development project.

961.11 SEVERABILITY.
   (a)    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of
this Ordinance is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such section, subsection, sentence, clause,
phrase or portion of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions of this Ordinance nor impair or nullify the remainder of
this Ordinance which shall continue in full force and effect.
   (b)    If the application of any provision of this Ordinance to any new
development is declared to be invalid by a decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction, the intent of the Village Council is that such decision shall be
limited only to the specific new development expressly involved in the
controversy, action or proceeding in which such decision of invalidity was
rendered. Such decision shall not affect, impair, or nullify this Ordinance as
a whole or the application of any provision of this Ordinance to any other new
development.

comfort, prosperity, and general welfare.
(Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1101.06 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
   This Subdivision Ordinance is adopted in whole and is a replacement of the

(Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1101.07 RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING.
   It is the intention of the Village Council that this Subdivision Ordinance
shall implement the subdivision policies adopted by the Village Council for the
Village of Plain City, as reflected in a comprehensive plan, land-use plan, and
all other planning documents formally adopted by the Village Council. While the
Council reaffirms its commitment that this Ordinance and any amendment to it be

(Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   Each chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other

the degree necessary to accomplish the objective and standards required for
planned districts. Nothing within this section, however, shall exempt the

street, road or access point and involving an existing tract of land from which
no more than five lots can be created, that meet the current lot requirements
for such zoning district, after the original tract has been completely
subdivided, may be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval
without plat. If the commission is satisfied that such proposed subdivision
complies with applicable zoning requirements, that the subdivision will not
necessarily preclude anticipated future development or redevelopment, and the
proposed subdivision does not interfere with the provision of Village services,
the Commission may direct the Village Administrator to stamp conveyances for
Lots within the Subdivision "Approved by Planning and Zoning Commission. No
Plat Required." The Commission may also establish reasonable necessary
procedures and requirements to be met by the owner desiring to subdivide
property pursuant to this section. This may include: requirements for the
extension or improvement of public infrastructure to support the subdivision or
possible growth or development for the area; additional specific provisions
required by the Commission, of the subdivision requirements, or other
requirements that are in the interest of the Village to be included as a
provision of the approval of the subdivision without plat. No Zoning permit of
Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued until all provisions
stipulated by the Commission have been completed and accepted by the Village in
accordance with the site development process.
 
   (b)    Districts other than RS 1, RS2, RS2A, RS3. A proposed Subdivision of
a parcel of land along an existing Public Street in all districts other than RS
1, RS2, RS2A, RS3, not involving the opening, widening or extension of any
street, road or access point and involving a tract of land from which no more
than five Lots can be created after the tract has been completely subdivided,
may be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval without
Plat. If the Commission is satisfied that such proposed Subdivision complies
with applicable Zoning requirements, the proposed subdivision does not
interfere with the provision of Village services and that the subdivision is
not contrary to the interest of the Village and the subdivision does not
necessarily preclude anticipated future development or redevelopment, the
Commission shall recommend to Council approval, or approval with modification
of such request, for Subdivision without Plat. Otherwise the Commission shall
disapprove the request for Subdivision without Plat. After approval or,
approval with modification of the Subdivision without Plat by the Commission,
Council may either approve or reject such request by resolution. A Super
Majority is required for Council to reject the recommendation of the
Commission. If Council elects to approve the Subdivision, it shall authorize
the Village Administrator to stamp the conveyance of such parcel "Approved by
Village Council: No Plat Required." The Commission and/or Council may establish
reasonable necessary procedures and requirements to be met by the owner
desiring to subdivide property pursuant to this section. This may include:
requirements for the extension or improvement of public infrastructure to
support the subdivision or development for the area; additional specific
provisions required by the Commission, of the subdivision requirements, or
other requirements that are in the interest of the Village to be included as a
provision of the approval of the subdivision without plat. No Zoning permit of
Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued until all provisions
stipulated by the Commission have been completed and accepted by the Village in
accordance with the site development process.

interest. If the State Director of Transportation notifies the Planning and
Zoning Commission that the State shall proceed to acquire the land needed, then
the Planning and Zoning Commission may refuse to approve the plat, according to
provisions of Section 5511.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)   At the request of the subdivider, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may give conditional approval and allow the developer to proceed
with completion of the plat. However, it shall be clearly at the subdivider's
own risk and the conditional approval shall be withdrawn if the State Director
of Transportation proceeds to acquire the land.
      (2)   If the State Director of Transportation notifies the Planning and
Zoning Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest,
or upon expiration of a 120-calendar day period from date of notice to the
State Director or any extension thereof agreed upon by the State Director of
Transportation and the property owner, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall, if the plat is in conformance with all provisions of this Subdivision
Ordinance, approve the plat.
      (3)   A copy of correspondence to the State Director shall be mailed to
the Zoning Inspector. The correspondence to the State Director shall indicate
the 120-calendar day notification deadline.

Council approve the final plat, the subdivider shall deliver to the Village
Fiscal Officer a bond and other items as required by Section
1129.02,
1129.03, and Chapter
1133. Upon review and approval of said items by the Village Engineer, the
Village Mayor and the Fiscal Officer shall sign the final plat and it may be
recorded. The placement of the Mayor's signature on the plat shall constitute
final approval of the subdivision. The required bonds shall be posted and the
plat placed on record within 6 months from the date of Council's approval or
the plat shall be null and void. Provided, however, the said time may be
extended by Village Council for good cause.
   If the plat is disapproved by Council, it shall be returned to the Planning
and Zoning Commission with recommendations for modification. A two-thirds
majority vote is required by Council to overturn a recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (h)    A "hard" copy of the final plat as recorded shall be submitted to the
Zoning Inspector. The developer may then begin constructing the infrastructure
improvements. Upon satisfactory completion of the subdivision as determined by

prepared by the developer shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector in mylar
form. Acceptance of the improvements shall occur upon adoption by Council of an
ordinance stating such acceptance.
   (i)    Application for building permits for lots within the subdivision
shall not be submitted until after the plat is recorded, all additional
engineering fees incurred by the Village for review have been paid, and a bond
is posted for 100 percent of the estimated construction and inspection cost of
the improvements, and other items as required by Sections
1129.02,
1129.03, and Chapter
1133. (Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)

(single family, residential density) with a per capita flow of 100 gallons per
day (gpd).
      (2)   For areas of greater population density than 12 persons per acre,
the design flow shall be determined on a basis of population instead of area
using the same per capita flow criteria.
      (3)   The sanitary sewer design shall be in accordance with the
"recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities," 2004 edition, by the Great

that the maximum overland drainage area tributary to any yard inlet or curb
inlet shall not exceed 1.5 acres. The maximum spacing for curb inlets shall not
exceed 400 feet unless approved by the Village Engineer. The maximum spread of
flow during a 2-year storm shall not exceed 8 feet for 30-foot wide streets and
9 feet for streets wider than 30 feet. Spread calculations may be required at
the discretion of the Village Engineer.
      (10)   The flow lines of pipes shall be set such that either the crown or
the 0.8 depth points at junctions are at the same elevation. However, the crown
of the outlet pipe may be lower.
      (11)   Where a 72-inch pipe is inadequate for a 2-year storm, an open
watercourse may be permitted. When so permitted, an easement shall be provided
at least equal to the area required for the 100-year rainfall. Also, the
easement shall be shown on the final plat as a "Watercourse and Utility
Easement." Restrictions as to the use of this easement shall be shown on the
final plat. No buildings, plantings, or other improvements shall be permitted
within that easement.
      (12)   No water will be allowed to cross a street intersection unless it
is carried in storm sewer.
   (c)   Storm Sewer Design Criteria.
      (1)   The method outlined herein will provide a general guide as to the
criteria and procedures to be used for storm sewer design.
         A.   The Rational Method shall be used for all stormwater drainage
design for areas up to 200 acres. Storm sewers shall be designed to carry a 2-
year storm flowing full Q = CIA, in which:
            Q =    Quantity of stormwater runoff in cubic feet per second
            C =    Coefficient of runoff (0.4 for single-family residential
areas)
            I =   Average rainfall intensity in inches per hour for the period
of concentration to the point under consideration. The minimum length of time
of concentration is 10 minutes to a curb inlet or 15 minutes to a ditch catch
basin.
            A =    Drainage area in acres tributary to the point of
concentration.
         B.   For drainage areas over 200 acres, the method explained in "Urban
Hydrology for Small Watershed, Technical Release No. 55" (known as TR-55) dated
June 1986 and the "Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release No. 55" dated April 1981 (can be obtained from the Soil
Conservation Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture) shall be used.
      (2)   The minimum time of concentration to the first curb inlet shall be
10 minutes. The minimum time of concentration to the first catch basin shall be
15 minutes. The elevations at the curb line shall be provided to the Village in
order to assure that this requirement is met.

conditions warrant or where necessary to retain fill or cut slopes within the
right-of-way. Such improvements shall require the approval of the Village
Engineer.
(Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1125.14 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Relationship to Comprehensive Plan. Where a proposed conservation
area, park or school site as shown in the Plain City Comprehensive Plan, or
other officially adopted planning documents is located in whole or in part
within a proposed subdivision, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require
the following:
      (1)   The dedication to the public of part or all of the proposed site,
as discussed below, and/or
      (2)   Reservation of the site for a period of up to 3 years to enable
acquisition by the appropriate agency.
   (b)    Minimum Dedication Requirements for Open Space. The subdivider shall
be required to reserve a minimum of twenty percent (20%), or such greater
standards as may be required by the development standards of the district, of
the total gross site area as permanent open space within the following
districts: RS1, RS2, RS2A, and MFR. The open space shall either be dedicated to
the Village of Plain City or other public agency which has expressed a desire
to accept and maintain the open space, or shall be transferred to a private
association or entity. The Village of Plain City shall be given the right of
first refusal. If the open space is transferred to a private association or
entity, acceptable provisions for the perpetual maintenance of the open space
shall be stated on the plat.
   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the authority to determine
whether or not
the proposed open space and maintenance provisions are acceptable.
   (c)   Payment in Lieu of Open Space Dedication. When the Planning and Zoning
Commission determines that open space dedication is not desirable within a
proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to pay a park fee in
lieu of open space dedication. The fee shall be collected at the time final
plat approval is requested.
      (1)   As to residential property the fee shall be calculated as follows:
         A.   Total land dedication required in acres = A
         B.   Value of land per acre = B
         C.   Value of land donation = AxB.
         D.   Determining value of land per acre. This amount shall be
determined in the following manner:
            1.   If the property has been sold within the past two (2) years,
and if the Village does not exercise its ability to independently appraise the
property, this value shall be determined by dividing the most recent sales
price by the total number of acres of the property;
            2.   If the property has not been sold within the past two (2)
years, and if the Village does not exercise its ability to independently
appraise the property this value shall be determined by a fair market valuation
provided by the subdivider and performed by a qualified land appraiser
acceptable to the Village;
            3.   If the Village so elects, and notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this section, this value shall be determined by a fair market
valuation performed by a qualified land appraiser employed by the Village. If
such an appraisal is elected, it shall be final and dispositive of the
valuation issue.
   (d)   Residential Dwelling Units Which Are Not Constructed as Part of a
Planned Development or Subdivision. In those instances where residential
dwelling units are constructed not as part of a subdivision or planned
development, each such residential unit shall pay the required park fee
established by Council.
   (e)   Minor Subdivision. Minor subdivisions shall not be exempt from open
space dedication or payment in lieu of dedication requirements.

   (a)   Hardships and Findings of Fact.
      (1)   Criteria. Where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that
extraordinary hardships may result from strict compliance with this Subdivision
Ordinance and/or the purposes of this Subdivision Ordinance may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to this
Subdivision Ordinance so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying any intent or purpose of this Subdivision Ordinance; and further
provided the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not approve variances unless
it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:
         A.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
         B.   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property;
         C.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of this Subdivision Ordinance are carried out;
         D.   Variances contrary to other applicable guidelines and ordinances
shall not be granted.
      (2)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this
Subdivision Ordinance. (Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1125.17 PLATTED EASEMENTS.
   The following standards shall govern the provision of easements:
   (a)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway,
channel, storm conduit, or stream, there shall be provided to the Village, a
stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the
lines of such water course and containing additional width as required for
maintenance.
   (b)   Easements, a minimum of 10 feet in width shall be provided adjacent to
each side of and contiguous with all proposed rights-of-way. Such easements
shall be used for any and all public or private underground utilities.
   (c)   Easements across lots or along side or rear lot lines shall be a
minimum 20 feet in width. The Village Engineer may require additional width
where appropriate, based on the proposed usage. If a proposed utility is
outside the right-of-way, a minimum of 7½ feet of clearance must be provided
between the centerline of the proposed utility and the edge of the easement. If
a proposed utility is within the right-of-way, an easement must be provided
adjacent to the right-of-way if the utility is less than 7½ feet from the
right-of-way line.
   (d)   Where subdivisions are adjacent to schools, parks, or other public
facilities, access easements shall be provided to those facilities where deemed
appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such access easement shall
be a minimum of 20 feet in width and side yard setbacks for adjacent lots shall
be measured from the easement. (Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1125.18 PRIVATE UTILITIES.
   (a)   All proposed utilities (including, but not limited to, gas, electric,
telephone, and CATV cables) shall be located underground throughout the
subdivision. Aboveground appurtenances such as electric pad mount transformer
boxes, telephone and cable pull boxes, etc., shall be located behind the set-
back line. Wherever existing utility facilities are above ground, unless
otherwise stipulated by the Village Engineer, they shall be placed underground.
(Ord. 06-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1125.19 PROTECTION OF WELLS.
   (a)   Where a subdivision is proposed to be located in an area in which
there are existing water wells within 300 feet of proposed sanitary sewers or
other potential pollution sources, the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or
Village Engineer may require that information be provided by the developer
sufficient to determine the potential impact of the installation of underground
utilities within the subdivision on the water table servicing said wells. The
Village Engineer shall determine if a high probability for impact exists. If
so, the Village Engineer may require that an approved barrier method be placed
on underground lines in such locations as the Village Engineer shall designate
to control said impact.
   (b)   A permanent easement is required within 300 feet of a public water
supply well to provide a sanitary control radius of protection.
   (c)   Furthermore, the Village may require wellhead protection easements in
accordance with the Wellhead Protection Plan report on file with the Village
Administrator.

in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of the improvements (storm
sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, pavements, sidewalks, curb and gutter,
and landscaping, etc.) based on the then current State of Ohio prevailing wage
rates. Said security shall be in favor of the Village of Plain City who shall
have sole control of disbursement. The local bank shall be directed to pay out
portions of the cash security towards the completion of said improvements to
the subdivider only with the approval of the Village Administrator, who may
require a balance to be maintained which in his opinion is sufficient to
complete said improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications of
the Village and shall authorize the release of any balance to the subdivider
only upon acceptance of said improvements by Council.
      (2)   The Village Administrator, Zoning Inspector, and Village Engineer,
in consultation with the subdivider, shall establish a time period for the
completion of required improvements. In the event said improvements are not
constructed within the designated time period and not maintained, the Village
shall have the option after 30 days' written notice to the subdivider to
complete and maintain said improvements and to collect and receive from the
local bank any remaining balance of said deposit to be applied toward payment
of costs and expenses of completing said improvements, or
   (b)   (1)   The subdivider may furnish corporate surety bond in the
principal amount of the estimated cost of said improvements with surety to the
satisfaction of the Mayor and Council, in such a form approved by the Village
Solicitor, guaranteeing completion and maintenance of said improvements
according to plans, profiles, and specifications and to the satisfaction of the
Village Engineer. Said bond shall remain in effect until said improvements have
been completed and maintained as provided in these regulations and until
released by authority of Council. Said bond shall provide that upon default of
performance by the subdivider the Village may complete the same after 30 days'
written notice.
      (2)   The subdivider shall maintain all improvements in the subdivision
and provide for snow removal in the same until final acceptance of all
improvements is granted. Concurrent with acceptance of the subdivision, the
subdivider shall submit a warranty/maintenance surety in an amount of ten

for two years following acceptance of any required improvements and shall
guarantee satisfactory performance of the said improvements.
      (3)   For a period of two years from the date the constructed
improvements are accepted by Council, the subdivider shall make such repairs or
replacements as may be required by reason of defective workmanship or material.
      (4)   In addition to the required performance bond, the Village Engineer
may require a restoration bond. Said bond shall be to insure repair of any
damage done to existing curb, gutter, sidewalk, driveways, street pavement,
landscaping, or other items within the right-of-way adjacent to a subdivision,
and damages as a result of a poorly executed erosion and sedimentation control
plan. The amount of said bond shall be as determined by the Village
Administrator based on his estimate of potential damage. Restoration bonds
shall be released when all damaged facilities, if any, have been restored to
the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. Where the subdivider is aggrieved by
a decision of the Village Engineer, he may appeal said decision to the Planning
and Zoning Commission.

times except from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. where one lane may be closed to
traffic during those working hours.
18.   All trenches shall be backfilled or securely plated during non-working
hours.
19.   Access to all adjoining properties shall be maintained at all times.
20.   The developer/owner shall, prior to any construction operation, deposit
with the Village of Plain City a retainer for inspection, supervision, and
testing of materials in the amount of ten (10) percent of the estimated
construction cost as approved by the Village.
21.   If the Village Police Chief determines proper provisions for traffic
control are not being provided by the contractor, the Village Police Chief
shall assign off-duty police officers to the project at the contractor's
expense.
22.   All site clearing (tree removal) shall be performed by the owner at his
expense prior to construction of this project.
23.   All areas within the public right-of-way that are disturbed by this
project shall be re-stored to original or better condition, per Item 659
(Seeding and Mulching) or other applicable specifications.
24.   At all utility crossings where the existing utility is exposed in the
trench, the backfill shall consist of compacted granular material in accordance
with Item 912 between the deeper and shallower pipe. Where proposed utilities
or services cross proposed or existing pavement areas, backfill shall be
compacted granular material in accordance with Item 912 extending at least
three (3) feet beyond the back of curb or edge of pavement. Cost is to be
included in the price bid for related pipe.
25.   In the event excavation for the street is from 0" to 6" below that called
for on the plans, the Contractor shall replace this excess excavated material
with Item 304 aggregate, and shall be paid for by the Contractor.
26.   Curb inlets, manholes, and catch basins shall be channeled as directed.
27.   The contractor shall provide two roof drain openings in the curb for each
lot, each opening located not more than four (4) feet in from each lot line.
28.   It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to adequately barricade
the street in the vicinity of all expansion joints until such time as the
street is open to traffic.
29.   The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Village of Plain
City prior to constructing any utility extensions.
30.   Where necessary to disturb pavements or drives, the pavement shall be saw
cut in neat, straight lines. The depth of saw cut shall be at least two (2)
inches.
31.   If the Contractor refuses or fails to perform work of an immediate nature
(such as the placement of barricades or replacement of signs or other devices)
required by this contract in a reasonable time, the Village will perform such
work. The contractor shall re-imburse the Village at the rate of 2.5 times the
actual cost of labor, materials, and equipment necessary to perform such work.
The Village shall notify or attempt to notify the Contractor of the necessity
to perform such work. The Village shall be reimbursed by the Contractor in the
amount provided herein. Reasonable time for all streets involved on this
contract is one (1) hour from the time of notification by the Village.
32.   Prior to the construction of the streets, soil tests shall be made on all
sanitary sewer and designated storm sewer trenches which cross the proposed
pavements or which lie such that the proposed pavements are located within any
part o the influence line of said trench. Where said results indicated that the
trench backfill does not meet the compaction requirements of Item 912,
paragraph 912.03, all backfill material shall be removed, replaced, and re-
tested until compaction meets requirement of Item 912, paragraph (j) 912.03.
(Ord. 03-09. Passed 4-13-09.)
33.   Erosion control measures in accordance with the requirements of the soil
conservation handbook Water Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing
Areas are required. Straw bales at storm sewer inlets shall be maintained until

      (4)   Determination of use. In the case of any use of land or structure
which cannot readily be determined to be a permitted, conditional or prohibited
use within a zoning classification or within any zoning classification, any
person may submit to the Zoning Inspector an application for determination
whether the use is either a permitted or conditional use in a specific zoning
classification or in any zoning classification of the zoning regulations. A
decision shall be made by the Zoning Inspector who in turn shall notify the
Planning and Zoning Commission prior to their next regular meeting of the
action he has taken and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the right
to override that decision, if it should find that the decision is arbitrary,
unreasonable or capricious. The determination by the Zoning Inspector shall be
for the purpose of enabling the applicant to otherwise comply with the zoning
regulations regarding necessary applications or permits to be obtained and the
decision shall in no way act as a commitment by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or any other agency of the Municipality as to future zoning,
approval of conditional uses or any other zoning matter.
 
   (b)    Existing Conforming Lots, Structures or Uses. Lots, structures or the
use of lots and/or structures which conform with the regulations of the zoning
district in which they are located may be continued, and may be altered,
extended or changed in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Conforming lots. A conforming lot may be changed, altered, enlarged
or reduced in dimension, provided however, that the remaining lot and/or
resulting lots shall conform to the development standards for the zoning
district in which the lot is located.
      (2)   Conforming structure. A conforming structure may be altered,
reconstructed or extended only in such manner as will comply with the
development standards of the zoning district in which the structure is located.
       (3)    Conforming use. A conforming use may be expanded, modified or
changed only in such a manner as will comply with the permitted use, or
conditional use (if previously approved) regulations and with the development
standards of the zoning district in which the conforming use is located.
   (c)    Existing Nonconforming Lots, Structures, or Uses. Lots, structures,
or the use of lots and/or structures which do not conform with the regulations
of the zoning district in which they are located may be continued, and may be
altered, extended or changed in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Nonconforming lots. The construction of a conforming structure and/
or the conduct of a permitted use shall be allowed on any lot of record which
has an area and/or lot width less than that required for such structure or
permitted use in the zoning district in which the lot is located. Variance of
any development standard other than minimum lot area and/or minimum lot width
shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1138. Additionally the requirements of Section
1183.10  apply.
      Such nonconforming lots must be in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other land in the same ownership on the effective date
of the Zoning Ordinance. Otherwise, development shall be permitted only in
accordance with the development standards of the zoning district in which such
ownership is located. Additionally, the requirements of Section
1183.10  apply.
      (2)   Nonconforming structures and development. Structures and/or
accessory development, which by reason of size, type, location on the lot, or
otherwise in conflict with the regulations of the zoning district in which they
are located may be altered, reconstructed or extended only in such manner that
the alteration, reconstruction or extension will comply with the development
standards of the zoning district in which the structure and/or accessory
development is located.
      Such alteration, reconstruction or extension shall include such
additional development and compliance with the development standards of the
zoning district as would be required of a new structure and/or accessory
development to the extent practicable and so that the spirit and intent of the
development standards are accomplished.
      (3)   Nonconforming uses. The nonconforming use of a lot and/or a
structure may be continued, expanded or changed subject to the following:
         A.   Change of a nonconforming use shall be allowed to a permitted use
of the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located.
         B.   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals a
nonconforming use may be changed to a use found to be more nearly in character
with the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located.
         C.   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals a
nonconforming use may be expanded within an existing structure manifestly
arranged or developed for such use.
         D.   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals a
nonconforming use may be extended provided that such will make the
nonconforming use substantially more in character with its surroundings. A
nonconforming use shall not be extended by more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the size of the nonconforming use that existed at the time of the passage of
this Zoning Ordinance.
         E.   No nonconforming use may be reestablished where such
nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of at least two years. The
nonconforming use of any structure damaged by fire, explosion, flood, riot or
act of God maybe continued and used as before any such calamity, provided
reconstruction is started within twelve months of such calamity, does not
enlarge or expand the structure as it existed immediately prior to such
calamity and is continued in a reasonable manner until completed.
         F.   On approval of an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, a
nonconforming use consisting of a "manufactured home park," as the same is
defined in O.R.C. Section 3733.01(A), may be improved if the improvement
consists of all of the following:
            1.    The replacement of all existing manufactured homes by
installation of a lesser number of new, larger manufactured homes; and
            2.    The installation of new underground electric and gas
utilities servicing all manufactured homes within the manufactured home park,
provided that such installation is in accordance with all federal, state and
local requirements; and
            3.    The installation of a new underground water distribution
system servicing all manufactured homes within the manufactured home park,
provided that such installation is in accordance with all federal, state, and
local requirements.
   (d)    Existing Conditional Use Permits. Nothing contained in this Zoning
Ordinance shall affect the validity or effectiveness of an existing Conditional
Use Permit issued under the prior Zoning Ordinance, Ordinance No. 25-73, as
codified by Ordinance No. 24-83, and as thereafter amended and effective prior
to the enactment of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)    Annexed Territory. Territory annexed to the Municipality after the
effective date of the Zoning Ordinance shall continue to be governed by the
zoning regulations which governed the territory annexed immediately prior to
the annexation, as enacted by a Board of County Commissioners under Ohio R.C.
303.01 to 303.25, or enacted by a Board of Township Trustees under Ohio R.C.
519.01 to 519.25, as the case may be.
   As soon as practicable after the annexation of territory to the
Municipality, proceedings shall be instituted by the Planning and Zoning

districts defined in the Zoning Ordinance, as amended.

Zoning permits shall be issued only in conformity with the provisions of this
Zoning Code unless the Zoning Inspector receives a written order from the Board

proposed for such building.
   A Zoning Permit is not required for re-roofing (including replacing
sheathing), window and door replacement without changing dimensions, or
remodeling where no walls or floors are added, changed, or removed.

of sales of the lots therein, or upon expiration of the Temporary Use Permit,
whichever occurs sooner.
   Temporary offices including mobile offices for contractors and equipment
sheds incidental to construction projects may be permitted within any district.
The permit shall not be valid for more than one (1) year but may be renewed for
six month extensions if construction is substantially underway. Such uses shall
be removed immediately upon completion of the construction project, or upon
expiration of the Temporary Use Permit whichever occurs sooner.
      (2)   In circumstances where building permits are issued by Union County
no such building permit shall be issued prior to the issuance of the proper
Zoning Permit by the Village Zoning Inspector. No building shall be occupied

of Plain City.
   (c)    Contents of Application for Zoning Permit. Each application for a
Zoning Permit shall be made in writing and be signed by the owner or applicant
attesting to the truth and exactness of all information supplied on the

application in conformance with the provisions of this Zoning Code. All zoning
permits shall, however, be conditional upon the commencement of work within one
year from date of approval. One copy of the plans shall be returned to the

be issued within three days after the request for same has been made in writing
to the Zoning Inspector, and after the erection or alteration of such building
or part thereof has been completed in conformity with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance. Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary
Certificate of Zoning Compliance may be issued by the Zoning Inspector for a
period not exceeding one year, during the completion of alterations or during
partial occupancy of a building pending its completion. Such temporary
certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective
rights, duties, or obligations of the owners or of the tenants relating to the
use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by the Zoning
Ordinance, and such temporary certificate shall not be issued except under such
restrictions and provision as will adequately ensure the safety of the
occupants.

shall hold a public hearing within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a
complete application and act on an application for a variance. At such hearing
the applicant shall present a statement and adequate evidence in such form as
the Board of Zoning Appeals may request. Failure to appear means the
application will be deemed dismissed or withdrawn by the applicant.
      (1)   Notice of Public Hearing in Newspaper. Before conducting the public
hearing required in Section
1138.05 (c) herein, notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality at least fifteen (15)
days before the date of said hearings. The notice shall set forth the time and
place of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.
      (2)   Notice to Parties in Interest. Before conducting the public hearing
required in Section
1138.05 (c) herein, written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the
Zoning Inspector by first class mail, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing to all property owners within 250 feet of the parcel at issue. Failure
of delivery of notice does not invalidate notice. This notice shall contain the
same information as required of notices published in newspapers as specified in
Section
1138.05 (c)(1) above. Failure of delivery of notice does not invalidate said
notice.
      (3)   Approval of Variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Within forty-
five (45) days after the public hearing required in Section
1138.05 (c), the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve, approve with
supplementary conditions, or disapprove the request for variance. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall only approve a variance or modification thereof if the
following findings are made:
         A.    That said area variance will not be contrary to the public
interest.
         B.    That said area variance is justified due to special conditions.
         C.   That the literal enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance will result
in practical difficulties. The factors to be considered and weighed in
determining whether practical difficulties have been encountered shall include,
but not be limited to the following:
            1.   Whether there can be any beneficial use of the property
without the variance;  
            2.    Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g. water, sewer, garbage);
            5.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction; and
            6.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance.
         D.    That the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance will be observed and
substantial justice done if the area variance is granted.
         E.   That the variance is based on need not convenience or profit.
      (4)   Use Variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals will not approve a use
variance. A change in use requires a rezoning consistent with the amendment
procedures outlined in Chapter
1136.
   (d)   Zoning Permit. A Zoning Permit may be issued for an approved variance.
   (e)    Building Permit. A building permit may be obtained only for the
development in accordance with the approved plot plan.

1141.03 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
    (a)    Generally. The boundaries of the zoning districts are shown upon the
Zoning District Map. The Zoning District Map and all notations, references and
other information shown thereon are a part of the Zoning Ordinance and have the
same force and effect as if the Zoning District Map and all the notations,
references and other information shown thereon were all fully set forth or
described herein, a certified copy of which district map is properly attested
and is on file with the Village Fiscal Officer of the Municipality.
    (b)    Rules for Determination. When uncertainty exists with respect to the
boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the Zoning District Map, the
following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Along a street or other right of way. Where zoning district
boundary lines are indicated as approximately following a center line of a
street or highway, alley, railroad easement or other right of way, or a river,
creek or other watercourse, such center line shall be the zoning district
boundary.
      (2)   Along a property line. Where zoning district boundary lines are
indicated as approximately following a lot line, such lot line shall be the
zoning district boundary.
      (3)   Parallel to right of way or property line. Where zoning district
boundary lines are indicated as approximately being parallel to a center line
or a property line, such zoning district boundary lines shall be parallel
thereto and, in the absence of specified dimension on the map, at such scaled
distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning District Map.
      (4)   Actual conflict with Map. When the actual street or lot layout
existing on the ground is in conflict with that shown on the Zoning District
Map, the party alleging that such a conflict exists, shall furnish an actual
survey for interpretation by Council.
      (5)   Right of way vacation. Whenever any street, alley or other public
way is vacated by official action of Council, the zoning district adjoining
each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended
to the center of such vacation, and all area included in the vacation shall
then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended
district or districts.

1143.01 REGULATION OF THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND AND STRUCTURES.
   Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures, and the
physical development thereof within each of the zoning districts adopted as a
standard zoning district in Chapter 1141, and as shown on the Zoning District
Map, are hereby established and adopted.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1143.02 RULES OF APPLICATION.
   The standard district regulations set forth in Chapters
1143 to
1175 shall be interpreted and enforced according to the following rules:
   (a)   Identification of Uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except where they are specifically defined or
limited in the Zoning Ordinance.
      (1)   When a listed use has a number preceding the name, it is the code
number and activity title as listed in the Standard Industrial Classification
Manual 1987.
      (2)   Industry code and title (four digits) shall include all activities
listed under the industry code other than those specifically excepted.
      (3)   The full text of the listings in the Standard Industrial
Classification Manual shall be a part of the definition of the use listed in
the Zoning Ordinance and is hereby adopted as a part of Chapters
1143 to
1175.
   (b)   Permitted Uses. Only a use designated as a permitted use shall be
allowed as a matter of right in a zoning district. Any use not so designated
shall be prohibited. When in character with the zoning district, additional
uses may be added to the permitted uses of a zoning district by amendment of
the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in a zoning district when such conditional use, its location, extent
and method of development will not substantially alter the character of the
vicinity or unduly interfere with the use of adjacent lots in the manner
prescribed for the zoning district. To this end the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall, in addition to the development standards for the zoning district, set
forth such additional requirements as will, in its judgment render the
conditional use compatible with the existing and future use of adjacent lots
and the vicinity.
   (d)   Development Standards. The development standards set forth shall be
the minimum allowed for development in a zoning district. If the development
standards are in conflict with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rules, regulations or laws, the more restrictive or higher standard shall
govern.

1181.01 OBJECTIVES FOR A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (a)    General Objectives. A planned unit development (PUD) shall be
classified as a unique zoning district or combination of districts that is
subject to the provisions of this chapter. The purpose is to encourage and
allow more creative and imaginative design of land development than is possible
under standard zoning district regulations. A PUD is intended to allow
flexibility in planning and design and overall benefits to the Village. A PUD
also permits the establishment of a variety of uses brought together as parts
of a compatible and unified plan. This flexibility should result in a
development that has unique characteristics and features that are not found in
a development produced in accordance with standard zoning district and
subdivision regulations.
   (b)   Specific Objectives.
      (1)    To encourage unified projects that exhibit creative planning and
design in ways that cannot be achieved through a standard zoning district, yet

   (a)    Minimum Lot Size and Zoning Requirements. Lot area, width, setbacks,
height, lot coverage, minimum floor area, parking, landscaping, lighting, and
other requirements for the district specified in the following table for the
proposed use shall apply to all such uses within a Planned Unit Development,
unless modified in accordance with the provisions of Section
1181.04 (c). Within a PUD, the minimum buffer requirements specified in Chapter
1175, between uses shall not apply; provided, the Planning Commission or
Village Council may require separation or buffering of uses as a condition of
preliminary plan approval.
   (b)    Modification of Minimum Requirements. Regulations applicable to a
land use in the Planned Unit Development district may be altered from the
requirements specified in Table
1181.03 (b), including the following: modification from the lot area and width,
building setbacks, height, lot coverage, signs, and parking. However, a
reduction in lot size shall not result in an increase in the number of
dwellings otherwise permitted by the applicable zoning district. Land gained by
the reduction in lot sizes shall be added to the open space required within the
PUD. The applicant for a Planned Unit Development shall identify, in writing,
all proposed deviations from the zoning district requirements. Modifications
may be approved by the Village Council during the preliminary development plan
review stage, after Planning Commission recommendation. Adjustments to the
minimum requirements may be permitted only if they will result in a higher
quality and more sustainable development, consistent with the purpose of the
Planned Unit Development district, as expressed in Section
1181.01.
    (c)    Density Bonus. In addition to the modification of minimum
requirements permitted in Section
1181.04 (b), the Planning Commission may permit an increase in the total number
of residential units otherwise allowed within a Planned Unit Development,
according to the requirements in Table
1181.04(g). The Planning Commission may grant a density bonus up to twenty-five
percent (25%) if the proposal meets all of the applicable criteria described
below and where it is demonstrated that:
      (1)    The appearance and construction will result in a development of
high quality, as evidenced by the innovative design and use of building
materials such as stone, masonry, wood and hardie- plank, but not including
vinyl; and
      (2)    Dedicated common open space is provided in excess of the minimum
required, per Section
1181.04(d).
      (3)    At least two of the following will be included within the
development:
         A.   Amenities, beyond the minimum required open space, will be
provided to create a more sustainable community and desirable living
environment.
         B.   Significant natural features, including stands of mature trees,

is proposed within the PUD.
         E.   Three or more public benefits, as identified in Section
 1181.02 (a)(10), will be achieved.
   (d)    Common Open Space. For purposes of the Planned Unit Development
requirements, "common open space" is defined as an area of land or water, or a
combination of land and water, designed and intended for the perpetual use and
enjoyment of the users of the development and/or the general public. Common
open space may contain accessory structures and improvements necessary or
desirable for educational, noncommercial, recreational, or cultural uses. A
variety of open space and recreational areas is encouraged such as: children's
informal play areas in close proximity to neighborhoods or dwelling unit
clusters; formal parks, picnic- areas and playgrounds; pathways and trails;
scenic open areas and communal, noncommercial recreation facilities; and
natural conservation areas. At a minimum, the following regulations shall apply
to all common open space within a Planned Unit Development.
      (1)    The area of common open space shall not be less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the total land area of a Planned Unit Development containing
only residential units. Not less than twenty percent (20%) of the total land
area of a Planned Unit Development containing only non-residential units. The
area of common open space requirement for mixed use Planned Unit Developments
will be determined by the Planning Commission. Land dedicated for recreation
use, in accordance with Section
1181.04(d)(3), shall count toward the common open space requirement.
      (2)    All common open space shown on the final development plan must be
reserved or dedicated by conveyance of title to a corporation, association, or
other legal entity, by means of a restrictive covenant, easement or through
other legal instrument. The terms of such legal instrument must include
provisions guaranteeing the continued use in perpetuity of such open space for
the purposes intended and for continuity of proper maintenance of those
portions of the open space requiring maintenance.
      (3)    The open space shall meet the following minimum dimensions,
contiguity, and connectivity requirements:
         A.   The required open space shall be centrally located, established
along the street frontage of the development to protect or enhance views,
located to preserve significant natural features, adjacent to dwellings, and/or
located to interconnect other open spaces throughout the development or on
contiguous properties.
         B.   Required open space areas shall be of sufficient size and
dimension and located, configured, or designed in such a way as to achieve the
applicable purposes of these regulations and enhance the quality of the
development. The open space shall neither be perceived nor function simply as
an extension of the rear yard of those lots abutting it.
         C.   If the site contains a lake, stream or other body of water, the
Village may require that a portion of the required open space shall abut the
body of water.
         D.   Open space shall be sufficiently aggregated to create large
useable areas of planned open space. All required open space areas shall be
configured so the open space is reasonably accessible to and usable by
residents, visitors, and other users of the development. The minimum size of
any individual open space area shall be sufficient to achieve the visual and
functional intent of the open space provisions and not simply be a remnant
piece of land; and, further provided, that the Planning Commission, may approve
other open space areas designed and established as pedestrian or bicycle paths
or are otherwise determined to be open space reasonably usable by residents,
visitors, and other users of the development.
         E.   Open space areas are encouraged to be linked with adjacent open
spaces, public parks, bicycle paths, or pedestrian paths.
         F.   Grading in the open space shall be minimal, with the intent to
preserve existing topography, trees, and other natural features, where
practical.
         G.   A sign, structure, or building may be erected within the required
open space if it is determined to be accessory to a recreation or conservation
use or an entryway. These accessory structure(s) or building(s) shall not
exceed, in the aggregate, five percent (5%) of the open space area. Accessory
structures or uses of a significantly different scale or character than present
in abutting residential districts shall not be located near the boundary of the
development if they may negatively impact the residential use of adjacent
lands. Pathways or sidewalks shall be exempt from this limitation.
         H.   The following areas shall not qualify as required common open
space for the purposes of this section.
            1.   The area within any public street right-of-way.
            2.   The area within private road easements.
            3.   The area within a subdivision lot.
            4.   Land within any required yard or setback area.
            5.   Parking and loading areas.
            6.   Fifty percent (50%) of any steep slopes (twelve percent (12%)
or over).
            7.   Seventy-five percent (75%) of any lake, stream, detention
pond, or floodplain that is not generally accessible within the development.
Accessible shall mean that the feature is bordered by a substantial open space
area, park, playground, pathway, or reasonable means of access for enjoyment of
all owners, visitors, or others, which will be determined and approved by the
Planning Commission.
            8.   Fifty percent of the area of any golf course.
            9.   Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way, unless
such land and rights-of-way are to be used for trail or other public purposes.

incorporated throughout the Planned Unit Development and along all perimeter
streets to ensure connectivity between uses and adjacent properties. Pathways
and sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the Village design
standards.
   (f)    Minimum Dimensions. Within a Residential Planned Unit Development
District, the minimum front setback will be determined for each street by the
zoning district in which the development is located. The setback should be
varied among adjacent lots by at least five feet. No more than one- third of
the lots within the subdivision may employ the minimum setback line, and the
varied setbacks should be reasonably dispersed throughout the subdivision. The
Planning Commission has the discretion to waive or modify this requirement
within PUD zoned areas provided it determines such action is warranted to
maintain a desired development style or design.
      (1)    Variation in lot width shall be required for all residential
subdivisions with more than eight lots, including those within Planned Unit
Development Districts. No more than six lots in a row may have the same lot
width. There must be a minimum variation of five (5) feet. Lots of varying
width must be dispersed throughout the subdivision. No more than fifty percent
(50%) of the lots contained within the preliminary plat shall be of the minimum
width. When all of the lots within a development are seventy (70) feet or
wider, then the varied lot width requirement shall not apply. The Planning
Commission has the discretion to waive or modify this requirement within PUD
zoned areas provided it determines such action is warranted to maintain a
desired development style or design.
      (2)    The minimum distance between single-family detached dwellings
shall not be less than fourteen (14)feet to any other main dwelling.
      (3)    The minimum distance between dwelling and side lot line is five
(5) feet.

family.
   (h)    Arrangement of Use Areas.
      (1)    Buildings and uses within the proposed development shall be
located to reduce any adverse influences and to protect and enhance the
character of areas adjacent to the development.
      (2)    Whenever a proposed development includes areas of a higher
intensity than that permitted in adjacent areas, the location and arrangement
of use areas shall include appropriate buffers, open spaces, setbacks, or other
transitional areas to ensure compatibility with the lower intensity areas.
      (3)    Buildings, structures, and parking areas shall be designed and
located within the PUD in ways that conserve environmentally sensitive or
unique natural, historic, or cultural features, and minimize environmental
impacts.
      (4)    When commercial, office or industrial uses are being proposed,
such buildings and establishments shall be planned to have shared common
parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the
number of potential conflict points.
      (5)    All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvements of development shall be landscaped or otherwise
maintained in a neat and orderly manner as may be specified by the Planning
Commission.
   (i)    Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering.
      (1)    In addition to Chapters
1187 and

twenty (20) feet in width measured from the edge of the delineated bank of a
river or perennial stream shall be provided along the entire length of
waterway. Walkways may be permitted to be located within riparian buffers when
the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such will create minimal
change to the riparian buffer.
      (2)    Wetlands that are to be retained in their natural state within the
PUD shall be protected. A buffer area not less than twenty (20) feet in width
measured from the edge of the delineated wetland shall be provided along the
entire perimeter of the designated wetland. The buffer area shall not be
disturbed and shall be retained in its natural state. Minimum building and
pavement setbacks to protect such wetlands and buffer areas shall be
established and shall be measured from the edge of such wetlands.

submit the request for extension in writing, prior to the expiration of the
original approval period, to the zoning administrator who shall make a written
determination regarding his decision to extend or deny the extension. Both the
request and the determination shall be made part of the record.

application, the applicant shall schedule a meeting with the zoning
administrator to discuss the applicable requirements and materials, compliance
with conditions that may have been imposed as part of the preliminary plan
approval, review procedures and conformance of the final development plan with
the approved preliminary plan. The zoning administrator shall notify other
appropriate staff. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the proposed
project and provide relevant information to the applicant. However, no
statements or representations made at this meeting shall be construed to be a
commitment or an assurance of approval on the part of the Village.
      (3)    Application. An application tor approval of the final development
plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator by the property owner or

         C.   Phased Projects. If a proposed Planned Unit Development is to be
constructed in two or more phases, final development plan approval may be
granted for individual phases; provided, a complete plan for the entire
development was first given preliminary plan approval and that each subsequent
phase shall be submitted for final development plan approval and is consistent
with the approved preliminary plan. The Planning Commission may require
additional information beyond what is otherwise required if, in its judgment,
more detailed information is necessary due to the size of the development;
number of phases proposed; or the interrelationship of roads, utilities or
drainage systems within the total site.
         D.   Planning Commission Action. Following receipt of a complete
application package, the zoning administrator shall cause the application

1184.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to identify land uses which require a Special
Permit due to unique characteristics relative to location, design, size,
operation, traffic circulation or need for public services and to provide
supplemental criteria which shall be applied by the Board of Zoning Appeals
when reviewing the proposed use. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1184.02 SPECIAL PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Within the Municipality, no building, structure or premises shall be used
and no building or structure shall be erected which is arranged, intended or
designed to be used for any use specified in this chapter unless a Special
Permit has been issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1184.03 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers and duties in
addition to those defined elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   To grant Special Permits for uses listed in this chapter where it is

    (a)    Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to regulate the proper
development and use of satellite dish antenna systems. In addition to
protecting from distractions and obstructions, it is the intent of these
regulations that satellite dish antennas are as much subject to control as
noise, odors, debris and like characteristics of a use that, if not controlled
and regulated, can become a nuisance factor to adjacent properties or the
community in general. To protect the general health, safety and welfare, and to
protect and encourage a more attractive economic, business and overall physical
appearance of the community, all satellite dish antennas are subject to the
regulations set forth in this section. This section shall not apply to
satellite dish antennas less than two feet in diameter.
    (b)    Permit Process. A Zoning Permit for the installation of all dish
antennae shall be issued to the owner of the property by the Zoning Inspector
or appropriate designee after approval of a Special Permit by the Board of
Zoning Appeals through the procedure described in Section
1138.07 . An accessory use permit will not be required. The Board will base its
approval upon a site plan submitted by the applicant and the extent to which
the plan demonstrates that the installation of the dish antenna is in
conformance with the guidelines of this Section.
   (c)   Fee. A fee in such amount as may be established by the Council acting
by ordinance or resolution shall be paid to the Municipality for each
application for a Special Permit to install a dish antenna.
   (d)   Regulations. No Zoning Permit shall be issued, and no satellite dish
antenna shall be installed or maintained, unless the satellite dish antenna

   (a)    General. The following four districts - Corridor Development Overlay
District, Central Development Overlay District, Wellhead Protection Overlay
District, and Resource Protection Overlay District are herein designated as
overlay districts. These districts are superimposed over other districts; their
requirements are accumulative with those of the underlying district in an
additive manner. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of the
overlay zone and those of the zone over which it is superimposed, as related to
a location situated in both districts, the more stringent requirement of the
two districts shall govern unless specified to the contrary except special
instances in the Central Overlay District when the less stringent of the
requirements may apply, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (b)    Relation to the Zoning District Map. The inclusion of land in an
overlay district shall be in addition to the zoning district as established on
the Zoning District Map. Nothing herein is intended to amend, modify, or
otherwise change the zoning district boundaries as shown on the Zoning District

   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of the Resource Protection Overlay District is
to protect stream valley habitat and stream water quality. In particular, the
purposes of this district are to:
      (1)   Preserve floodplain areas in a natural or improved state;
      (2)   Preserve wetlands associated with floodplain areas;
      (3)   Preserve significant special habitat areas associated with stream
valleys;
      (4)   Prevent soil erosion and sedimentation by protecting steep slopes
adjoining stream valleys;
      (5)   Protect persons and property from environmental hazards such as
unstable or highly erodible soils and flooding;
      (6)   Filter nutrients, toxics and sediment from stormwater;
      (7)   Protect scenic values of natural resources;
      (8)   Provide recreational opportunities and pedestrian access to
waterway resources; and
      (9)   Minimize public investment and maintenance in floodplain stormwater
management.
   (b)   Scope. These regulations shall apply to all proposed developments
within (partially or entirely) the boundary of the overlay district, including
projects for which subdivision, site plan, and building permits or approvals
are necessary.
   (c)   Application. The Resource Protection Overlay District shall apply to
all perennial, intermittent and ephemeral streams within Plain City.
   (d)   District Boundaries. The Resource Protection Overlay District shall
encompass stream valleys, steep slopes, associated wetlands and floodplains, if
present; and a buffer, as called for in
1185.05(e) and
 1185.05(f) herein. Except as provided for in this chapter, the land within
this district is to remain in an undisturbed natural statege, and the outer
edge of this district shall constitute the limits of clearing and grading.
   (e)   Design Standard Stream Buffer Widths.
      (1)   The following design standard buffers shall be as follows:
         A.   Three hundred feet on each side of all perennial streams as
measured from the stream centerline at the time of design.
         B.   One hundred feet on each side of all intermittent and ephemeral
streams as measured from the stream centerline.
         C.   Fifty feet on each side of all agricultural drainage and road
ditches, as measured from the ditch centerline.
      (2)   The buffer shall extend outward from both sides of the stream
channel centerline. The buffer shall be measured horizontally from the stream
channel centerline without regard for the lay of the land.
   (f)   Buffer Adjustments for Adjacent Nontidal Wetlands, One-hundred-year
Floodplains and Steep Slopes.
      (1)   The buffer shall be expanded beyond the design buffer to account
for nontidal wetlands regardless of the wetland classification when adjacent to
the stream as follows:
         A.   Within the development district, to include all lands 25 feet
from the outer edge of nontidal wetlands adjacent to the stream channel.
         B.   Outside the development district, to include all lands measured
from the edge of nontidal wetlands adjacent to the stream channel measuring 50
feet for intermittent or ephemeral streams or 100 feet for perennial streams.
       (2)   Where the one-hundred-year floodplain extends beyond the design
buffer adjusted for nontidal wetlands, if applicable, the extent of the one-
hundred-year floodplain shall become the extent of the design buffer.
      (3)   The design buffer shall be further increased to account for steep
slopes that are contiguous with or within 25 feet of the design buffer.
         A.   The design buffer width shall be increased by 50 feet for
intermittent or 100 feet for perennial streams or shall extend to the top of
the slope, whichever is less, where average slopes greater than 15% adjoin the
design buffer or are within 25 feet of the design buffer limits.
         B.   Percentage of average slopes shall be determined by plotting a
transect from the outer edge of the design buffer to the top of the adjoining
slope, defined as the point at the top of slope where the slope falls below
15%, and calculating an average slope from the slope percentages crossed by the
transect. The number of transects will vary depending on the uniformity of
slopes adjoining a particular reach of a stream. Transects may be spaced up to
100 feet apart, regardless of slope uniformity. However, transect spacing
exceeding 100 feet shall be based on slope uniformity.
   (g)   Use Restrictions. The following uses shall be prohibited in the
Resource Protection Overlay District:

be constructed, altered, or expanded unless the minimum landscaping required by
the provisions of this chapter is provided. In the case of an alteration or
expansion, such landscaping shall be provided to the extent required only by
the alteration or expansion, unless the alteration or expansion is substantial.
If the alteration or expansion is substantial, then the minimum landscaping
required shall be provided to the entire property. An alteration or expansion
to an existing property is substantial when:
      (1)   In the case of a building or structure expansion which does not
involve additional land, the square footage of the alteration or expansion
exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the square footage of the existing
building exclusive of the alteration or expansion; and
      (2)   In the case of an alteration or expansion involving both an
existing building or structure and additional land, and, if applicable,
additional structures or buildings, the area or square footage of the expanded
or altered land or structure or building, respectively, exceeds twenty-five
percent (25%) of the area or square footage of the existing land or structure
or building, respectively, exclusive of the alteration or expansion.
      (3)   "Land" as use herein, includes land used for space, parking, or
building purposes. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1187.04 MINIMUM LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS.
    (a)    This section describes the minimum landscape requirements that shall
be met in regard to perimeter landscaping for noncompatible land use areas,
landscaping or service areas, and interior landscaping for businesses,
buildings, structures, or other new developments of the land. For the purposes
of this section, the following shall be considered "noncompatible":
      (1)   The location of a residential land use area adjacent or contiguous
to a business, commercial, or industrial land use area;
      (2)   The location of a business or commercial land use area adjacent or
contiguous to a residential or industrial land use area; or
      (3)   The location of an industrial land use area adjacent or contiguous
to a residential, business, or commercial land use area;
      (4)   The location of a multi-family residential land use area adjacent
or contiguous to a single family residential land use area.
   (b)    Perimeter Landscaping Requirements. Unless otherwise provided,
landscape materials, fences, or walls used to meet this requirement shall be
installed to provide one hundred percent (100%) year round opacity within four
years after installation. Landscape materials must be an evergreen species. The
required landscaping shall be provided either in easements in certain zones or
adjacent to vehicular use areas.
      (1)   Property perimeter requirements. Refer to Table 1.
      (2) Vehicular use area perimeter requirements.  Refer to Table 2.
 
Table 1. Property Perimeter Requirements
Key to Chart Below:
(1)   Six feet shall be the least dimension for any commercial or industrial
zone, with three feet as the least dimension for any other zone.
(2)   Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the easements
not occupied by other landscape material.
(3)   Tree sizes are as defined in Section
1187.09 . 
(4)   "OFT" means "or fraction thereof". Trees do not have to be equally
spaced, but may be grouped.

Table 2. Vehicular Use Area Perimeter Requirements
Key to Chart Below:
(1)   Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all portions of the easements
not occupied by other landscape material.
(2)   "Vehicular Use Area" is defined in Section
1187.09.
(3)   Tree sizes are as defined in Section
1187.09.
(4)   "OFT" means "or fraction thereof"
(5)   The intent of these requirements is to improve the appearance of
vehicular use areas and property abutting areas. The vehicular use area
perimeter requirement for vehicular sales facilities allows creation of
"picture frame(s)" along streets for vehicular sales display. The following
formula shall be used to determine the display area allowed per street
frontage: Linear distance of street frontage (from lot line to lot line or lot
line to corner in feet) x .25 = display area (in feet). Vehicles in the display
area shall be located behind the 12 inch planting and all vehicles shall be
parked at grade. Screening requirements for the remaining vehicular use areas
that adjoin a street frontage shall be similar to those for other uses with two
exceptions. The size of trees at installation is increased and the spacing
between trees is reduced. These requirements will help to mitigate the glare
from artificial lights.

                                        right of way
 
 
      (3)   Landscape buffer zone. The landscape buffer zone and material
required adjacent to any street under this chapter shall be provided by the
property owner adjoining street, unless the authority building the street has
fully met all requirements on the street right of way. When adjacent to other
common boundaries, the landscape buffer zone and materials:
         A.   May be placed on either adjoining parcel, or astride the
boundary, if both are owned and being processed by the same owner; or
         B.   Generally shall be placed on the activity listed under column B
in Table 1 or Table 2 of this chapter, when adjoining parcels have different
owners; or
         C.   May be placed astride the boundary of adjoining parcels having
different owners if a written agreement, signed by both owners, is filed with
the Zoning Inspector, as a public record; or
         D.   Shall be placed on the activity or parcel being processed when
adjoining property is already developed, with the exception of lines 5 and 6 in
Table 1 of this chapter; or
         E.   Shall not be required along the common boundary if the
requirements of this chapter have been fully complied with on the adjoining
property, in fulfillment of the requirements of this chapter.
      (4)   Requirements conflict. Whenever a parcel or activity falls under
two or more of the categories listed in Table 1 or Table 2 of this chapter,
only one category, that with the most stringent requirements shall be enforced.
      (5)   Landscape buffer zone conflicts. The required landscape buffer zone
may be combined with a utility or other easement as long as all of the
landscape requirements can be provided in addition to, and separate from, any
other easement. Cars or other objects shall not overhang or otherwise intrude
upon the required landscape buffer zone more than two and one-half feet, and
wheel stops or curbs shall be required.
      (6)   Existing landscape material. Existing landscape material shall be
shown on the required plan, and any material in satisfactory condition may be
used to satisfy these requirements in whole or in part when, in the opinion of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, such material meets the requirements and
meets the objectives of this chapter.
 
   (c)    Interior Landscaping for Vehicular Use Areas. Any open vehicular use
area, excluding loading, unloading, and storage areas in an industrial zone or
business zone, containing more than 6,000 square feet of area, or twenty or
more vehicular parking spaces, shall provide interior landscaping in addition
to the previously required perimeter landscaping. Interior landscaping may be
peninsular or island types.
      (1)   Landscape area. For each 100 square feet or fraction thereof, of
vehicular use area, a minimum total of five square feet of landscaped area
shall be provided.
         A.   Minimum area. The minimum landscape area permitted shall be
sixty-four square feet with a four-foot minimum dimension to all trees from the
edge of pavement where vehicles overhang.
         B.   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no individual landscape area shall be
larger than 350 square feet in size, and no individual area shall be larger
than 1,500 square feet in vehicular use areas over 30,000 square feet. In both
cases, the least dimension of any required area shall be four feet minimum
dimension to all trees from the edge of pavement where vehicles overhang.
Individual landscape areas larger than the above are permitted as long as the
additional area is in excess of the required minimum total.
      (2)   Minimum trees. The following minimums are required, based upon
total ground coverage of structures and vehicular use areas:
         A.   Up to 20,000 square feet: A minimum of one tree per 5,000 square
feet of ground coverage, and a total tree planting equal to one inch in tree
trunk size for every 2,000 square feet of ground coverage.
         B.   Between 20,000 and 50,000 square feet: A minimum of one tree for
every 5,000 square feet of ground coverage, and a total tree planting equal to
ten inches plus one-half inch in tree trunk size for every 2,000 square feet
over 20,000 square feet in ground coverage.
         C.    Over 50,000 square feet: A minimum of one tree for every 5,000
square feet of ground coverage, and a total tree planting equal to twenty-five
inches plus one-half inch in tree trunk size for every 4,000 square feet over
50,000 square feet in ground coverage.
         D.   Trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five feet above the
ground, and the remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs, or ground
cover, not to exceed two feet in height.
      (3)   Vehicle overhang. Parked vehicles may hang over the interior
landscaped area no more than two and one-half feet, as long as concrete or
other wheel stops are provided to ensure no greater overhang of the landscaped
area. See the illustration in Appendix B.
   (d)    Landscaping for Service Structures. Service structures shall be
screened in all zoning districts. For the purposes of this section, service
structures shall include, but not be limited to, loading docks, propane tanks,
dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend above the
surface, and other equipment or elements providing service to a building or
site. Structures may be grouped together; however, screening height shall be
based upon the tallest of the structures.
      (1)   Location of screening. Screening shall have a one hundred percent
opacity and consist of a continuous planting, hedge, fence, or wall of earth.
Screening shall enclose the service structure on all sides, unless the service
structure must be frequently moved, in which case screening on all but one side
is required. The average height of the screening material shall be one foot
more than the height of the enclosed structure, but shall not be required to
exceed seven feet in height. Whenever a service structure is located next to a
building wall, perimeter landscaping material, or vehicular use area
landscaping material, such walls or screening material may fulfill the
screening requirement for that side of the service structure, if that wall or
screening material is of an average height sufficient to meet the height
requirement set out in this section. Whenever service structures are screened
by plant material, such material may count toward the fulfillment of the
required interior or perimeter landscaping. No interior landscaping shall be
required within an area screened for service structures.
      (2)   Curbs to protect screening material.  Whenever screening material
is placed around any trash disposal unit or waste collection unit which is
emptied or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a curb to
contain the placement of the container shall be provided within the screening
material on those sides where there is such material. The curbing shall be at
least one foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent possible
damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.
   (e)    Interior Landscaping for All New Developments. All new developments,
regardless of the type, and all alterations or expansions to existing
developments shall provide interior landscaping in addition to the previously
required perimeter landscaping. Interior landscaping shall consist primarily of
new tree planting or the preservation of existing trees or hedges within the
development site, consistent with the requirements of Chapter
1189.
      (1)   Preservation of existing landscaping materials. See Chapter
1189.    Tree planting requirements.
         A.   For all new developments, the following landscape requirements
shall apply:
New Development Landscape Requirements:

                                     shall be landscaped areas equal to 20
                                     square feet for every 1,000 square feet
Business and Community Shopping Uses of building ground coverage area, or
per lot                              fraction thereof. Such landscaped areas
                                     shall contain trees, planting beds,
                                     hedges, fences, walls, earth mounds,
                                     benches, or other materials designed and
                                     located in a manner complimentary to the
                                     overall architecture of the surrounding
                                     buildings.

diameter.
         D.   For new development or construction, if new tree plantings are
required for conformance to the landscaping requirements of this chapter, the
applicant or owner shall indicate on the landscape plan the location and size
of such tree plantings. If such landscape plan is approved, the applicant or
owner shall plant such trees as may be required within one year or the next
planting season after issuance of a zoning permit. Failure to comply with the
landscaping requirements shall be in violation of this section and be subject
to such penalties as provided in Section
1135.99 .
            (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1187.05 LANDSCAPE MATERIALS.
   The landscaping materials shall consist of the following, and should
complement the form of the existing trees and plantings, as well as the
development's general design and architecture. The type of shade or sun should
be considered in selecting plant materials.
   (a)   Walls and Fences. Walls and fences shall be structurally sound and
constructed of stone, brick, or wood.
   (b)   Earth Mounds. Earth mounds shall be physical barriers which block or
screen the view, similar to a hedge, fence, or wall. Mounds shall be
constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent erosion. A
difference in elevation between areas requiring screening does not constitute
an existing earth mound and shall not be considered as fulfilling any screening
requirement.
   (c)   Plants. Artificial plants are prohibited. All plant materials shall be
living plants and shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Quality. Plant materials used in conformance with the provision of
this chapter shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspections required under State
regulations.
      (2)   Deciduous trees. Trees which normally shed their leaves in the
fall, shall be species having an average mature crown spread of greater than
fifteen feet in Central Ohio, and having trunks which can be maintained with
over five feet of clear wood in areas which have visibility requirements,
except at vehicular use area intersections, where eight feet clear wood
requirement shall control. Trees having an average mature crown spread of less
than fifteen feet may be substituted by grouping of the same so as to create
the equivalent of a fifteen foot crown spread. A minimum of ten feet overall
height or a minimum caliper (trunk diameter measured at four feet above the
ground) of at least one and three-fourths inches immediately after planting
shall be required. Trees of species whose roots are known to cause damage to
public roadways or other public works shall not be planted closer than fifteen
feet to such public works, unless the root system is completely contained
within a barrier for which the minimum interior containing dimensions shall be
five feet square and five feet deep and for which the construction requirements
shall be four inch thick, reinforced concrete.
      (3)   Prohibited trees. No silver maple, poplar, box elder, basswood,
willow or honey locust shall be permitted.
      (4)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of five feet
high with a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches immediately after
planting.
      (5)   Shrubs and hedges. Shall be at least two feet for Section
1187.04  (b)(2), and three feet for Section 
1187.04  (b)(1), in average height when planted and shall conform to the
opacity and other requirements within four years after planting.
      (6)   Vines. Shall be at least twelve or fifteen inches high at planting,
and generally used in conjunction with walls or fences.
      (7)   Grass or ground cover. Grass of the fescue (Gramineae) or bluegrass
(Poaceae) family shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns
in Central Ohio, and may be sodded or seeded, except in swales or other areas
subject to erosion, where solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch
shall be used. Nurse-grass seed shall be sown for immediate protection until
complete coverage otherwise is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and free of
weeds and noxious pests or diseases. Ground cover shall be planted in a manner
as to present a finished appearance and seventy-five percent (75%) of complete
coverage after two complete growing seasons, with a maximum of eight inches on
center. In certain cases, when approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission,
ground cover may consist of rocks, pebbles, sand, and similar approved
materials.
   (d)    Maintenance and Installation. All landscaping materials shall be
installed in a sound, workmanship-like manner and according to accepted, good
construction and planting procedures. The owner of the property shall be
responsible for the continued proper maintenance of all landscaping materials,
and shall keep them in a proper, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse
and debris at all times. All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced
within one year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first, while
other defective landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within three
months. Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be
grounds for the Zoning Inspector to refuse to issue a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance or to institute legal proceedings.
   (e)   Pruning. Landscaping materials used to fulfill code requirements, or
conditions of approval, as authorized by Council, Planning and Zoning
Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, or other appropriate body may not be
pruned or otherwise treated so as to reduce height or level of opacity to less
than required by this chapter. Landscape materials are intended to grow,
spread, and mature over time, and pruning or other inhibiting measures,
including removal, may only be practiced to ensure the public safety, to
maintain a neat and attractive appearance, and to preserve the health of the
material involved.
      (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1187.06 PLAN SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL.
   Whenever any property is affected by these landscape requirements, the
property owner or developer shall prepare a landscape plan for submittal to the
Zoning Inspector for review. Where such plans are part of an application for
rezoning, variance, conditional use, or other matters which must be approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals, such plans
shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector fifteen business days before the
first meeting of the approving body, or along with the application if there are
other required plans. All other landscape plans shall be approved by the Zoning
Inspector prior to issuance of a building permit.
   (a)    Plan Content. The contents of the plan shall include the following:
      (1)   Plot plan, drawn to an easily readable scale no smaller than one
inch equals twenty feet, showing and labeling by name and dimensions:
         A.    All existing and proposed property lines;

installation size, on center planting dimensions where applicable, and
quantities for all plants used;
         H.    All existing trees.
         I.   Such other documentation as may be necessary to determine
conformance.
      (2)    Typical elevations and/or cross sections as may be required;
      (3)   Title block with pertinent names and addresses, property owner,
person drawing plan, scale, date, north arrow (generally orient plan so that
north is to top of the plan), and zoning district.
   (b)   Zoning Permit and Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
      (1)   Where landscaping is required, no Zoning Permit shall be issued
until the required landscaping plan has been submitted and approved, and no
Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be issued until the landscaping is
completed as certified by an on-site inspection by the Zoning Inspector, unless
a performance bond, or irrevocable letter of credit from a banking institution,
has been posted.
      (2)   If the required landscaping has not been completed and a temporary
Certificate of Zoning Compliance is issued, a performance bond or irrevocable
letter of credit from a banking institution shall be posted at that time.
      (3)   All trees and plantings shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.04 , including the restrictions of Tables 1 and 2, and a written
certification to this effect shall be submitted by the landscaper upon

irrevocable letter of credit has been posted, the landscaping material required
in the approved landscaping plan shall be installed within six months after the
date of posting the bond or irrevocable letter of credit. A one-month extension
of the planting period may be granted by the Zoning Inspector upon a
demonstration by the property owner or developer that such an extension is
warranted because of adverse weather conditions or unavailability of required
plant materials. No more than three such one-month extensions may be granted.
Foreclosure proceedings shall be brought against the performance bond or
irrevocable letter of credit if the required landscaping plans have not been
complied with by the end of the approved planting period.
(Ord. 13-11. Passed 10-24-11.)
1187.07 VARIANCES.
   Any landscape plan submitted to, and disapproved by the Zoning Inspector may
be appealed according to the procedure provided for in Chapter
1138 for appeal from decisions by administrative officers and the Planning and

planting of streets trees by adjacent property owners provided that the
selection and location of the trees is in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
   (e)    Dead or Diseased Tree Removal on Private Property. The Village shall
have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased tree(s) located on
private property within the Village, and/or cause the removal of branches of
trees located on private property within the Village which overhang public
property, when such trees constitute a hazard to life or property, or harbor an
epiphytotic disease which constitutes a potential threat to other trees within
the Village, as determined by a professional arborist. The Zoning Inspector
shall notify, in writing, the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by
such owners at their own expense within sixty days after the date of service of
written notice, unless a longer period is agreed to in writing by the Zoning
Inspector, to allow time to attempt to treat and cure a salvageable diseased
tree. In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the
Village shall have the authority to remove any such tree(s) and charge the cost
of removal to the owner's property tax notice.
   (f)   Reducing Treelawn. No person shall by any type of construction reduce
the size of a treelawn without first procuring permission from the Zoning
Inspector.

frontage, or fraction thereof, along each road.
      (3)   The minimum spacing between trees shall be 40 feet for large trees,
30 feet for medium trees and 20 feet for small trees.
      (4)   The maximum spacing between trees shall be 45 feet for large trees,
35 feet for medium trees, and 25 feet for small trees.
      (5)   The minimum distance between the tree and the edge of the street
shall be two and one-half feet for a large tree, two feet for a medium tree and
one and one-half feet for a small tree. In areas where a sidewalk exists or is
proposed, the minimum distance between the tree trunk and both the edge of the
street and the sidewalks shall be two feet for a large tree, two feet for a
medium tree and one and one-half feet for a small tree.
      (6)   The tree location shall be at least 20 feet from street
intersections and ten feet from fire hydrants or utility poles.
      (7)   A small tree shall be used when planting under or within ten
lateral feet of overhead utility wires. A small or medium tree shall be used
when planting within ten to 20 lateral feet of overhead utility wires.
      (8)   Trees are to be planted within the rights-of-way of roads within
and abutting the development as directed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (9)   Each tree at the time of installation shall have a minimum caliper
of 1.75 inches and a clear trunk height of at least six (6) feet.

1191.01 PURPOSES.
   (a)   These Regulations are adopted to establish feasible and economically
reasonable standards aimed at achieving a level of management and conservation
practices which will minimize erosion of the soil and degradation of the waters
of the State by soil sediment, caused by non-farm earth-disturbing activities.
   (b)   These Regulations are also adopted for the following purposes, but are
not limited to such purposes:
      (1)   To permit development while keeping downstream flooding, erosion
and sedimentation at minimal levels.
      (2)   To reduce damage to receiving streams which may be caused by
increases in the quantity and/or rate of water discharged, and to reduce
impairment of their capacity which may be caused by sedimentation, other
pollutants or other hydrologic modifications.
      (3)   To establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems
which will preserve the rights and options of dominant and servient property
owners, help assure the long-term adequacy of storm and drainage systems, and
ensure that post-construction water quality meets or exceeds preconstruction
levels. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.02 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.

not necessary to submit an erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan.
However, the responsible person must comply with other provisions of these
Regulations. Submittal of specific information may be required to determine
compliance.
   (b)   When a proposed development area consists, when submitted, of one or
more acres and earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or
any part thereof, the owner of record shall develop an erosion, sediment and
stormwater control plan and submit the same for review of its adequacy. Such a
plan shall contain sufficient information, drawings and notes to describe how
soil erosion and off-site sedimentation will be kept to a minimum, both during
and after construction. No earth-disturbing activities shall commence prior to
review and approval of the erosion, sediment and stormwater control plan by the

1191.09 PROTECTION OF ADJACENT PROPERTIES.
   (a)   Properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be
protected from sediment deposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a
well-vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance,
by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters or dikes,
or sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
   (b)   Vegetated filter strips may be used alone only where runoff in sheet
flow is expected. Filter strips should be at least fifteen (15) feet in width.
If at any time it is found that a vegetated filter strip alone is ineffective
in stopping sediment movement onto adjacent property, additional perimeter
controls shall be provided.

   Construction entrances shall be established prior to the start of
construction and shall be the sole entrances on and off the property. The
location of the construction entrance(s) shall be shown on the erosion,
sedimentation control plan.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.11 TIMING AND STABILIZATION OF SEDIMENT TRAPPING MEASURES.
   Sediment basins and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other
measures intended to trap sediment on-site shall be constructed as a first step
in grading and be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place.
Earthen structures such as dams, dikes and diversions shall be seeded and
mulched within 48 hours of completion of installation. These structures will be
inspected every seven days or within twenty-four hours of a rain event greater
than 0.5 inch and will be maintained until vegetative cover sufficient enough
to control erosion is established.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.12 SEDIMENT BASINS.
   (a)   Where five acres or more of the development area is disturbed,
stormwater runoff shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable
sediment trapping facility with equivalent or greater storage capacity.
Sediment basins or traps may be required for smaller disturbed areas if deemed
necessary. The sediment basin requirement may also be waived, by variance, if
the approving agency agrees that site conditions do not warrant its
construction.
   (b)   The sediment settling basin shall be sized to provide at least 67
cubic yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When
determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site area and areas,
which remain undisturbed by construction, must be included unless runoff from
these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling basin and is not co-
mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment settling basin
must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration between inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two (2) units of length for each
unit of width (>2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the
sediment settling basin when the design capacity has been reduced by 40% (this
typically is reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth). When
designing sediment basins, you must consider public safety, especially as it
relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin. Alternative
sediment controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe
design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion control measures in
order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
   (c)   For drainage locations serving less than five (5) acres, smaller
sediment basins, and/or sediment traps shall be used.
   (d)   Unless otherwise designed, sediment basins are temporary and shall be
removed following final stabilization of the site when vegetation is sufficient
enough to control erosion.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.13 CUT AND FILL SLOPES.
   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will
minimize erosion. Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of
the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and
other applicable factors. Slopes which are found to be eroding excessively
during the first year after construction shall be provided with additional
slope stabilizing measures by the developer until the problem is corrected. The
following guidelines are provided to aid in the development of and adequate
design for the site.    (a)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred
to smooth surfaces on slopes.
   (b)   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes which
have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces may
also be used to reduce slope length.
   (c)   Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut and
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope drain
structure.
   (d)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided. A geotechnical engineer may be utilized to evaluate the site in
questionable situation.
      (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.14 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CRITERIA.
   (a)   To control pollution of public waters by soil sediment from
accelerated stream channel erosion, and to control floodplain erosion caused by
accelerated stormwater runoff from development areas, the increased peak rates
and volumes of runoff shall be controlled such that:
      (1)   The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the development area does not exceed the peak rate
of runoff from a two-year frequency, twenty-four hour storm occurring on the
same area under predevelopment conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm up to the 100-year storm have peak runoff rates no greater than
the peak runoff rates of equivalent size storms under predevelopment
conditions. Consideration of the one, two, five, ten, twenty-five, fifty and
100-year storm will be considered adequate in designing and developing to meet
this standard.
      (3)   The critical storm for a specific development area is determined as
follows:
         A.   Use the SCS TR-55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or its
replacement, to determine the total volume of runoff from a two-year frequency
twenty-four hour storm occurring on the development area before and after
development. Other design methods approved by the approving agency can also be
used.
         B.   From the volumes determined in paragraph (a)(3)A. hereof,
determine the percentage of increase in the volume of runoff due to
development, and, using this percentage, select the twenty-four hour critical
storm.
   (b)   Methods for controlling increases in stormwater runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to, the following: (Listed in order of
preference)
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction. (For example,
using grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
and discharging roof water to vegetated areas or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.)
      (2)   Grading and construction of terraces and diversions to slow runoff
and use of grade control structures to provide a level of control in flow paths
and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased stormwater runoff into the soil
where practical. (For example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be re-vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.)
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention. (For example, utilizing
permanent ponds and lakes with proper drainage; multiple use areas for
stormwater detention, recreation, wildlife, fire protection and aesthetics; or
subsurface storage areas.) (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.15 STABILIZATON OF WATERWAYS AND OUTLETS.
   All on-site stormwater conveyance channels except roadway ditches shall be
designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a ten-
year frequency storm without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion
shall also be provided at the outlet of all pipes and paved channels. (Ord. 05-
08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.16 STORM SEWER INLET PROTECTION.
   All storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment. Said
inlet protection cannot be removed from the inlet until the section of the site
surrounding it has been deemed sufficiently stable by the site inspector.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.17 WORKING IN OR CROSSING OF WATERCOURSES.
   (a)   Construction vehicles should be kept out of a watercourse to the
extent possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken
to stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel
(including bed and banks) shall always be restabilized immediately after in-
channel work is completed.
   (b)   Where a live (wet) watercourse will be crossed by construction
vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be
provided.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.18 DISPOSITION OF TEMPORARY MEASURES.
   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of
within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved, as determined by
the inspecting agency or after temporary measures are no longer needed, unless
otherwise authorized by the inspecting agency. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall
be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.19 MAINTENANCE.
   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their
intended function. The developer will be responsible for such maintenance until
the final inspection. For long-term maintenance, see Section
1191.26. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.20 PUMPING WATER.
   Under no circumstance shall water be directly pumped into the receiving
stream or other waterways. There shall be no turbid discharges to surface
waters of the State resulting from de-watering activities. If trench or ground
water contains sediment, it must pass through a sediment settling basin or
other equally effective sediment control device, prior to being discharged from
the construction site. Alternatively, sediment may be removed by settling in
place or by de-watering into a sump pit, filter bag, or comparable practice.
Groundwater de-watering which does not contain sediment or other pollutants is
not required to be treated prior to discharge. However, care must be taken when
discharging ground water to assure that it does not become pollutant-laden by
traversing over disturbed soils or other pollutant sources.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.21 DUST CONTROL.
   A water truck equipped with suitable sprinkling devices and street-sweeping
equipment shall be on-site during periods of dry weather for dust control.
Water shall be applied at least 4 times a day to all unpaved surfaces during
periods of dry weather to help control the dust. The County Engineer may
require additional measures as covered by ODOT CMS 616. Streets shall be swept
daily to remove material from paved streets onto which such material has been
deposited by trucking, earth-moving, erosion by water, or other means.
Evaluations shall be performed during representative, normal working conditions
by the contractor. No evaluation shall be necessary if the area is covered with
snow, ice, or if precipitation has occurred that is sufficient for dust
control. The following information shall be recorded by the contractor for dust
control maintenance.
   (a)   The date and reason any required inspection was not performed,
including those evaluations that were not performed due to snow and/or ice
cover or precipitation.
   (b)   The date of each evaluation where it was determined that it was
necessary to implement the control measures.
   (c)   The dates and the type of control measures that were implemented.
      (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)

compliance of a revised plan, earth-disturbing activities shall proceed only in
accordance with conditions outlined by the approving agency.
(Ord. 13-11. Passed 10-24-11.)
1191.24 INSPECTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   The Approving Agency, as designated by the Village of Plain City,
shall inspect development areas to determine compliance with these Regulations.
If periodic inspections or other information indicates a control has been used
inappropriately or incorrectly, the contractor must replace or modify the
control for the site conditions.
      (1)   When a practice requires repair or maintenance; If the inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of sediment basin clean-out, or sediment basin removal, it must be
repaired or maintained within 48 hours of the inspection. Sediment basin clean-
out or removable must occur within seven (7) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function: If the
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
sediment and erosion control plan must be amended and a new control practice
must be installed within seven (7) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the sediment and erosion control plan
are not installed: If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not
been implemented in accordance with the schedule contained on the plan, the
control practices must be implemented prior to the next storm event, which
produces runoff from the site, but in no case later than seven (7) days from
the date of inspection. If the inspection reveals that a planned control
practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   If the deficiency or non-compliance has not been corrected or the plans have
not been approved by the Zoning Inspector for its correctness, said deficiency
or non-compliance shall be reported to the Village Solicitor for action. If it
is determined at the time of inspection that the magnitude of the violation is
such that the issue requires immediate resolution, the inspecting agency may
define the time frame in which such violation must be resolved.
 
   (b)   If the Zoning Inspector determines that a violation exists and
requests the Village Solicitor, in writing, to take action, the Zoning
Inspector shall seek an injunction or other appropriate relief to abate
excessive erosion and sedimentation and to secure compliance with these
Regulations. In granting relief, the court may order the construction of
sediment control improvements or implementation of other control measures.
   (c)   A final inspection shall be made to determine if the criteria of these
Regulations have been satisfied.
(Ord. 13-11. Passed 10-24-11.)
1191.25 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by an order, requirement, determination or any other
action in relation to these Regulations may appeal to the Court of Common
Pleas. Such an appeal shall be made within twenty calendar days of an order or
decision and shall specify the grounds for appeal.
(Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1191.26 MAINTENANCE.   
   (a)   Permanent Runoff Control Installations. When permanent runoff control
installations are necessary, the maintenance responsibility shall be determined
by the approving agency. The maintenance responsibility of said installation(s)
will be either the Village, through appropriate sections of the Ohio
Constitution, or privately by the property owner or a group of property owners.
   (b)   Maintenance by Union or Madison County. When determined appropriate by
the inspecting agency or Village, the person(s) developing a site shall
petition the County for maintenance of permanent runoff control installations
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 6131, provided that such required installations:
      (1)   Benefit two or more property owners; and
      (2)   Are designed for cost-effective maintenance.
   (c)   Maintenance by the Property Owner or Group of Property Owners. When
determined appropriate by the approving agency, permanent runoff control
installations which are to be privately maintained by the property owner or a
group of property owners shall be:
      (1)   Designed and constructed by the person(s) developing the site with
easements or agreements sufficient to allow adequate access for inspections and
corrective actions, if necessary, by the approving agency;
      (2)   Regularly inspected by the Approving Agency to ensure that
privately maintained installations are properly maintained and, if not,
maintained at the expense of the responsible owner(s) by order of the approving
agency. In any controversy arising between the owner(s) and the approving
agency regarding the maintenance of said installations, the decision of the
approving agency shall be final.
      (3)   Maintained and installed by the person(s) developing the site
according to the approved design and not altered unless approved by the
approving agency. In the event of a change in ownership, the new party is
responsible for compliance.
   (d)   Maintenance Within Subdivisions. Should the maintenance of any
permanent runoff control installations be within a subdivision plat, the
maintenance responsibilities shall be described on the recorded plat of the
said subdivision.

1197.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to encourage lighting practices
and systems which will minimize light pollution, glare, and light trespass;
conserve energy and resources while maintaining nighttime safety, utility, and
security; and reverse the degradation of the nighttime visual environment. It
is recognized that the topography, atmospheric conditions, and nature of the
Village are unique and valuable to the community. The Village, through the
provisions contained in this title, promotes the reduction of light pollution
that interferes with enjoyment of the night sky. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)
1197.02 CONFORMANCE WITH APPLICABLE CODES.
   All outdoor electrical lighting systems shall be installed in conformance
with the provisions of this title, the latest adopted versions of the Village
Building Code, the National Electrical Code, any additional requirements of the
Ohio Industrial Commission, and all other applicable laws. If there are
conflicts between any code requirements, the more restrictive requirements will
apply. (Ord. 05-08. Passed 2-25-08.)

business shall be considered terminated if it has ceased operations for at
least 30 consecutive days. Seasonal businesses are exempted from this
determination.
      (3)    When the sign on its immediate premises is not maintained in
accordance with Section
1199.09(b)(l).
      (4)    The sign is not repaired as directed by the Zoning Inspector in
accordance with the standards of Section
1199.09(b)(2).
   (b)    The Zoning Inspector shall notify the property owner and the owner of
the sign if they can be located, of the determination that said sign is
abandoned. Upon determination that the sign is abandoned, the right to maintain
and use such sign shall terminate immediately. The Zoning Inspector or designee
shall issue an order for the sign to be removed within thirty days. Any
abandoned sign still standing after thirty days following an order for removal
may be removed by the Municipality and the cost of the removal certified to the
County Auditor for collection as a special assessment against the property upon
which such sign is located. The property owner or sign owner may appeal such
decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in Chapter
1138. The Zoning Inspector shall maintain a photograph of said sign along with
a written report of any finding in a permanent file.

1309.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Plain City has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Plain
City as identified in Section
1309.01 (f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Village of Plain City.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of this chapter, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Madison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Madison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective June 18, 2010.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Study Union County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Union County, Ohio and incorporated Areas, both
effective December 16, 2008.
      (3)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways, or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (4)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Plain City as required by Section
1309.04 (c) Subdivisions and Large Developments; and
      (5)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. Such maps and/
or studies are on file at the office of the Zoning Inspector, 213 S.
Chillicothe Street, Plain City, Ohio 43064.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between this
chapter and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall be
followed. This chapter shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by this
chapter.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over this
chapter.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of Plain City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 10-10. Passed 4-12-10.)
1309.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" means a request for a review of the Zoning Inspector's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   (c)   "Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation," or "BFE" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one (1) to three (3) feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.

   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)" means the Executive
Order issued by President Carter in 1977, which order requires that no
federally assisted activities be conducted in, or have the potential to affect,
identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable
alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency," or "FEMA" means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood," or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map," or "FHBM" usually means the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map," or "FIRM" means an official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one-hundred
(100) year flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the one-hundred (100) year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one-hundred
(100) year flood; with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually sheet
flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one-hundred
(100) year flood; flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one-hundred
(100) year flood to be protected from the one-hundred (100) year flood by a
Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations
are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of five-hundred (500) year flood;
areas subject to the one-hundred (100) year flood with average depths of less
than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than one (1) square
mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
five-hundred (500) year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study," or "FIS" means the official report in which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation," or "FPE" is the base flood elevation
plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Zoning Inspector.
   (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one (1) foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)    "Historic Structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Plain City whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change," or "LOMC" means an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of Map Amendment," or "LOMA" which is a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of Map Revision," or "LOMR" which is a revision based on
technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric
features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning
whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood
elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision," or "CLOMR" which is a formal
review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the
minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A
CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in this chapter for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or
more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle". For the purposes of this chapter, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park" means, as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three (3) or more
manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or
enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three (3) or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the Village of Plain City.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program," or "NFIP" means the Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after October 3, 2006 December 15, 1983, the
initial effective date of the Village of Plain City Flood Insurance Rate Map,
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" or "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," means
the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" means the date the Certificate of Zoning
Compliance was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the certificate date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its condition before
the damage would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   "Variance" is a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this chapter. (Ord. 12-06. Passed 9-11-06.)

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1309.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Plain City, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Plain City have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Plain City's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Plain City boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Plain City suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Plain City has

   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this chapter.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot (1') at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot (1') increase in the base flood elevation
may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an in-
crease of one foot (1') or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation
why these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1309.04(i)(1)B, items 1 and 3-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of this chapter, a

diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with The
Village of Plain City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the

         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Determination of Variance. Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this chapter
does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this chapter,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (5)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1309.05(d)(3)A to Section
1309.05(d)(3)K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reason-able time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Court of Common Pleas of the county
within which the property which is the subject of the decision is located, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of this chapter and shall be punishable in accordance with Section
1309.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,

1309.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines

of this chapter that have been violated, and order remedial action which, if
taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,

the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a
strict liability offense, and shall constitute a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the Village of Plain City. Each day such violation continues

which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations or
processes which have been adopted or are in use, unless the person did not and

the violation.
